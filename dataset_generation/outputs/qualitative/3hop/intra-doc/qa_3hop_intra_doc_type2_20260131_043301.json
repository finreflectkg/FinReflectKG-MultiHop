      "question": "How does Texas Instruments' use of total return swaps to hedge deferred compensation liabilities align with their broader market risk exposure and hedging strategy, particularly in light of the $393 million deferred compensation liability and the $12 million in mutual fund hedges recorded as long-term investments?",
      "answer": "Texas Instruments utilizes total return swaps to economically hedge against variability in compensation charges tied to deferred compensation obligations, which totaled $393 million as of December 31, 2023. These swaps are used alongside $12 million in mutual fund investments to offset changes in the fair value of deferred compensation liabilities. This aligns with their broader market risk management strategy, where they also use forward currency contracts to hedge balance sheet exposures and recognize changes in the fair value of these instruments in SG&A. The use of total return swaps reflects a targeted approach to managing exposure to employee-related liabilities while maintaining a broader framework of financial instrument hedging.",

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching sav ings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to v arious inv estment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are prov ided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after Nov ember 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan prov ides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receiv e the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 5 million shares in both periods v alued at $852 million and $873 million, respectiv ely. Div idends paid on these shares in 2024 and 2023 were $26 million and $27 million, respectiv ely. Effectiv e April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $76 million, $75 million and $70 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue serv ice-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of serv ice and the highest fiv e consecutiv e years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants.",

The contribution rates are based upon v arious factors, the most important of which are an employee's date of hire, date of retirement, years of serv ice and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan's participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement.\n\n## Non-U.S. retirement plans\n\nWe provide retirement cov erage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee's years of serv ice and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an indiv idual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as a result of employees' elections, TI's non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock v alued at $34 million in both periods.

      "answer": "TI strategically aligns its R&D investments with its competitive advantages in manufacturing and market reach to support long-term free cash flow per share growth. The company emphasizes manufacturing innovation\u2014such as its 300mm wafer technology, which reduces costs by ~40%\u2014as a core differentiator that enhances supply chain control and lowers structural costs. This manufacturing strength is complemented by a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, allowing TI to leverage R&D investments across a wide range of customer applications. Additionally, TI's direct sales model, which accounts for ~80% of revenue, gives the company deeper access to customer design projects, enhancing the return on R&D by aligning innovation with real-world demand. These combined advantages are explicitly tied to TI\u2019s long-term capital allocation strategy, which included $20 billion in capital expenditures from 2015 to 2024, reinforcing the integration of R&D, manufacturing, and customer engagement to drive sustainable free cash flow per share growth.",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that competitiv e performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on sev eral factors, including the breadth of a company's product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innov ation, product dev elopment execution, technical support, customer serv ice, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that prov ide differentiated lev els of performance and a structural cost adv antage are competitiv e factors for our analog products, and customers' prior inv estments in software dev elopment is a competitiv e factor for our embedded processing products.\n\n## Market cycle\n\nThe 'semiconductor cycle' refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inv entories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inv entory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur rev enue is subject to some seasonal v ariation. Historically, our sequential rev enue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters.\n\n## Customers, sales and distribution\n\nWe sell our products to ov er 100,000 customers. Our customer base is div erse, with about half of our rev enue deriv ed from customers outside of our largest 50.\n\nWe market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and marketing team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Ov er the past sev eral years, we hav e been inv esting in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. In 2024, about 80% of our rev enue was direct, which includes TI.com. Our inv estments in new and improv ed capabilities to directly support our customers include order fulfillment serv ices, inv entory programs, business processes and logistics and website and e-commerce capabilities. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel adv antage and giv e us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access giv es us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n\nIn addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each dev ice on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial inv estments.\n\nWe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.\n\nWe invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitiv e adv antage prov ides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain, offering our customers geopolitically dependable capacity. We hav e focused on creating a competitiv e manufacturing structural cost adv antage by inv esting in our adv anced 300mm capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300mm wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200mm wafer.\n\nWe continue to inv est to strengthen our competitiv e adv antage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity plan to meet demand over time. Semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotiv e markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Progress and inv estments include:",

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objectiv e and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share ov er the long term.\n\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitiv e adv antages. The four sustainable competitiv e adv antages are powerful in combination and prov ide tangible benefits:\n2. (a)    A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that prov ides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n3. (b)    A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more v alue for our inv estments.\n4. (c)    T he reach of our market channels that giv es access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and giv es us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n5. (d)    Div ersity and longev ity of our products, markets and customer positions that prov ide less single point dependency and longer returns on our inv estments.\n\nTogether, these competitiv e adv antages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our inv estments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and lev eraging of these adv antages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, dev elop new capabilities, inv est in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striv ing for more output for ev ery dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitiv e adv antages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will inv est to strengthen our competitiv e adv antages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate v alue.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:\n\n- Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.\n- When we discuss our results:\n- Unless otherwise noted, changes in our rev enue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are ev idenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.\n- New products do not tend to hav e a significant impact on our rev enue in any giv en period because we sell such a large number of products.\n- From time to time, our rev enue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the 'mix' of products shipped.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we hav e design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. In 2024, we generated $15.64 billion of rev enue.\n\nFor decades, we hav e operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from v acuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation has become more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors are used by a growing number of customers and markets. Our passion continues to be aliv e today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications.\n\nFor many years, we hav e run our business with three ov erarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ev er changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable and env ironmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achiev ing these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innov ate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objectiv e and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.\n\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\nThe first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitiv e advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made ov er the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitiv e adv antages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and div ersity and longev ity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitiv e advantages prov ide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitiv e adv antages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our inv estments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and lev eraging of these adv antages.\n\nThe second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, dev elop new capabilities, inv est in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Ov er a 10-year period from 2015 to 2024, we allocated $101 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation ov er this period was to driv e organic growth, which includes inv estments in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inv entory. In this period, we allocated about $20 billion to capital expenditures. Our increased capital expenditures are to support future rev enue growth, which will be a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to div idends and share repurchases. Div idends are designed to appeal to a broad set of inv estors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretiv e capture of future free cash flow for long-term inv estors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectiv es.\n\nThe third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striv ing for more output for ev ery dollar spent. This is about getting our inv estments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improv ement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to rev enue growth, improv ed gross margins, disciplined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's treatment of Volume Licensing Programs in revenue recognition align with the auditor's focus on revenue recognition complexity and the company's cash flow dynamics related to unearned revenue?",
      "answer": "Microsoft recognizes revenue from Volume Licensing Programs, including Enterprise Agreements and Software Assurance (SA), either upfront or ratably over the contract period depending on the distinct performance obligations involved. The auditor specifically highlighted the complexity of revenue recognition for multi-element customer agreements under these programs, indicating that this area required significant judgment and scrutiny. Additionally, the company reported a significant increase in unearned revenue tied to these programs, with a $31.0 billion rise in cash from operations driven by customer payments, particularly for multi-year licensing contracts invoiced annually. This alignment shows that Volume Licensing Programs are a critical and complex component of Microsoft's revenue model, with material impacts on both financial reporting and cash flow.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MSFT (page_62) \u2192 Volume Licensing Programs: Revenue from Volume Licensing Programs, including SA, is recognized ratably over the contract period as SA comprises distinct performance obligations satisfied over time.",

        "Hop 3: MSFT (page_49) \u2192 Volume Licensing Programs: Unearned revenue, largely from Volume Licensing Programs, is typically invoiced annually at the start of each contract period and recognized over time, contributing to a $31.0 billion increase in cash from operations."

      "question": "How does Microsoft's inclusion and optional treatment of Software Assurance across different licensing programs reflect its financial recognition strategy and partner-driven sales model?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's treatment of Software Assurance (SA) reflects a nuanced alignment between its licensing programs, financial reporting, and go-to-market strategy. Across its licensing programs, SA is variably positioned as either included, optional, or required, depending on the agreement type \u2014 for example, it is included in Open_Value agreements, optional in Microsoft Products and Services Agreements and Select Plus, and required with certain volume licensing agreements. This variability is mirrored in the financial reporting, where SA contributes to unearned revenue that is recognized ratably over the contract period, indicating a long-term revenue recognition model tied to multi-year licensing commitments. Additionally, the sales model reinforces this structure, as SA is often transacted through partners such as LSPs and VARs, especially for large and medium-sized organizations, showing that SA is not only a product but also a leveraged component in Microsoft\u2019s broader partner ecosystem.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_16) \u2192 [Software Assurance]: SA is described as a licensing benefit included in or optional with volume licensing agreements, and it is a required purchase with certain programs.",
        "Hop 2: [MSFT](page_49) \u2192 [Software Assurance]: SA is listed as part of unearned revenue, which is invoiced annually at the beginning of the contract period and recognized ratably over the coverage period.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](page_17) \u2192 [Software Assurance]: SA is included in Open_Value agreements, optional in Microsoft Products and Services Agreements and Select Plus, and part of the Enterprise Agreement structure, showing varied deployment across licensing models."

      "answer": "Microsoft positions Copilot as a transformative AI product that is deeply embedded across its strategic priorities. In the AI strategy section, Copilot is described as a key driver of a 'new era of AI transformation' that enhances productivity across roles and industries. Within the product ecosystem, Copilot is integrated into Windows (as Copilot in Windows), developer tools like GitHub Copilot, and security offerings such as Copilot for Security. In the advertising context, Copilot is tied to Bing Search and Microsoft Edge, where it enhances search capabilities and content generation, supporting user acquisition and engagement. This multi-faceted positioning illustrates Copilot's role as a unifying AI assistant across enterprise, developer, and consumer domains.",

References herein to AMD or the Company mean Adv anced Micro Dev ices, Inc. and its  consolidated  subsidiaries. AMD's  products  include Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) Accelerators,  x86  microprocessors  (CPUs)  and  graphics  processing units  (GPUs),  as  standalone  dev ices  or  as  incorporated  into  accelerated  processing  units  (APUs),  chipsets,  data  center  and  professional  GPUs, embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, microprocessor and SoC development services and technology, data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), System on Modules (SOMs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs), and Adaptiv e SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\n\n## NOTE 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nFiscal Year .  T he  Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 ended on December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2022 consisted of 53 weeks.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company's accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\nReclassification  and  Change  in  Presentation. Unbilled  receiv ables  of  $1.1  billion  as  of  December  30,  2023  were  reclassified  from  within  Accounts receiv able, net to within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Statements of Cash Flows to conform to current period presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rev enues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely  to  differ  from  those  estimates,  and  such  differences  may  be  material  to  the  financial  statements. Areas  where  management  uses  subjectiv e judgment include, but are not limited to, rev enue allowances, inv entory v aluation, v aluation of goodwill and long-liv ed and intangible assets, and income taxes.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or serv ices and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or serv ices. Sales, v alue-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the prov ision  of  goods  or  serv ices  are  excluded  from  rev enue.  Shipping  and  handling  costs  associated  with  product  sales  are  included  in  cost  of  sales. Substantially all of the Company's rev enue is deriv ed from product sales.\n\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and serv ices within the Company's standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30  to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not hav e significant financing components in its contracts with customers.\n\n## Non-custom products\n\nThe  Company  transfers  control  and  recognizes  rev enue  when  non-custom  products  are  shipped  to  customers,  which  includes  original  equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under  OEM  agreements.  The  Company  also  sells  to  distributors  under  terms  allowing  the  majority  of  distributors  certain  rights  of  return  and  price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of v ariable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a prov ision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.",

Our  technologies  adv ance  the  future  of  data  centers,  powering  the  cloud  serv ices  that  hav e  become  an  essential  part  of  how  we  work,  game,  and connect  to  network,  PCs,  edge  computing,  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  We  driv e  innov ation  through  high-performance  and  adaptiv e  computing technology, software and product leadership.\n\nWith our high-performance product portfolios, we deliv er differentiated solutions, such as our semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoCs), Adaptiv e SoCs, and accelerated processing units (APUs), and platform lev el client computing dev ices, embedded platforms and serv ers for our customers. We offer a deep portfolio of data center computing solutions including AI accelerators, microprocessors (CPUs), graphic processing units (GPUs), data processing units (DPUs),  Smart  Network  Interface  Cards  (SmartNICs),  and  field  programmable  gate  arrays  (FPGAs),  to  meet  the  v ast  computing  performance requirements  of  today's  data  centers,  supercomputers, AI  and  Machine  Learning  (ML)  data  center  env ironments  and  cloud  env ironments.  We  driv e innov ation  with  our  line-up  of  CPUs, APUs  and  chipsets  for  desktops  and  notebooks,  to  bring  performance,  efficiency, AI  capabilities  and  modern security features to gamers, creators, consumers and enterprises. AMD was the first company to integrate a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) on the same SoC as an x86 CPU for AI PCs. Our GPUs, including discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services, work together with software to power immersiv e gaming experiences for PCs, game consoles and cloud gaming serv ices. We are a leader in embedded computing, where we deliv er high-performance and scalability across a full portfolio of CPUs, APUs, FPGAs, system on modules (SOMs) and Adaptiv e SoCs that are  used  in  a  v ariety  of  markets,  including  automotiv e,  industrial,  healthcare,  storage  and  networking.  We  also  incorporate  dedicated AI  processing capabilities into our embedded portfolio.\n\nWe  develop  world-class  software  stacks  that  are  used  to  enable  our  high-performance  products.  Our  software  stacks  include  dev elopment  tools, compilers, and driv ers for our CPUs, APUs, GPUs and FPGAs. We work closely with our customers to define and dev elop customized solutions to precisely match their requirements. We enable this by combining our broad portfolio of high-performance IP with our leadership design and packaging to deliv er world-class customized solutions to our customers. We inv est in innov ativ e technology and solutions such as our custom-ready chiplet platform and AMD Infinity Architecture to maintain our leadership position as a custom-design silicon prov ider of choice.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nWe believe that AI is defining the next era of computing and that the full potential of AI will be realized when the technology is perv asiv e across cloud, edge and end devices. We believ e AMD has the compute engines, intellectual property, software capabilities and expertise to be a leader in this next computing era with a broad, portfolio of high-performance compute engines spanning across supercomputing, cloud, edge, embedded and end dev ices. We believe we hav e a unique opportunity to make AMD the end-to-end AI leader based on the breadth of our technology and product portfolios.\n\nOur AI strategy is focused on three priorities. T he first is deliv ering a broad portfolio of high-performance adaptiv e hardware and software solutions. T he second is expanding the deep and collaborativ e partnerships we hav e established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD based AI solutions at scale. And the third is prov iding compelling user experiences to extend the open and prov en software platform we hav e established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed more broadly and easily.\n\nOne of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our Data Center segment. The demand for our data center AI accelerator products was v ery strong as large hyperscaler customers, OEMs and ODMs deployed our AMD Instinct\u2122 MI300X  GPUs. During the year, we announced that we have accelerated our AMD AI accelerator roadmap to deliv er an annual cadence of leadership AMD  Instinct solutions.  We announced our 5th  Gen AMD EPYC\u2122 family of server processors, prov iding leadership performance and capabilities for a wide range of data center workloads.\n\nDuring the year, we completed the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI expanded our capability to accelerate dev elopment and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has also dev eloped a software stack used to train multiple state-of-theart large language models (LLMs) on AMD Instinct accelerators that can accelerate the dev elopment of highly-performant AMD training solutions.",

Our  software  stacks  include  dev elopment  tools, compilers, and driv ers for our CPUs, APUs, GPUs and FPGAs. We work closely with our customers to define and dev elop customized solutions to precisely match their requirements. We enable this by combining our broad portfolio of high-performance IP with our leadership design and packaging to deliv er world-class customized solutions to our customers. We inv est in innov ativ e technology and solutions such as our custom-ready chiplet platform and AMD Infinity Architecture to maintain our leadership position as a custom-design silicon prov ider of choice.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nWe believe that AI is defining the next era of computing and that the full potential of AI will be realized when the technology is perv asiv e across cloud, edge and end devices. We believ e AMD has the compute engines, intellectual property, software capabilities and expertise to be a leader in this next computing era with a broad, portfolio of high-performance compute engines spanning across supercomputing, cloud, edge, embedded and end dev ices. We believe we hav e a unique opportunity to make AMD the end-to-end AI leader based on the breadth of our technology and product portfolios.\n\nOur AI strategy is focused on three priorities. T he first is deliv ering a broad portfolio of high-performance adaptiv e hardware and software solutions. T he second is expanding the deep and collaborativ e partnerships we hav e established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD based AI solutions at scale. And the third is prov iding compelling user experiences to extend the open and prov en software platform we hav e established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed more broadly and easily.\n\nOne of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our Data Center segment. The demand for our data center AI accelerator products was v ery strong as large hyperscaler customers, OEMs and ODMs deployed our AMD Instinct\u2122 MI300X  GPUs. During the year, we announced that we have accelerated our AMD AI accelerator roadmap to deliv er an annual cadence of leadership AMD  Instinct solutions.  We announced our 5th  Gen AMD EPYC\u2122 family of server processors, prov iding leadership performance and capabilities for a wide range of data center workloads.\n\nDuring the year, we completed the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI expanded our capability to accelerate dev elopment and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has also dev eloped a software stack used to train multiple state-of-theart large language models (LLMs) on AMD Instinct accelerators that can accelerate the dev elopment of highly-performant AMD training solutions.",

Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.

      "question": "How does AMD's historical legal settlement and licensing agreement with Intel, referenced in its contractual obligations, align with the competitive pressures described in its risk factors and the ongoing market rivalry outlined in its segment competition analysis?",
      "answer": "AMD's historical relationship with Intel is defined by a Settlement Agreement and Patent Cross License Agreement dated November 11, 2009, which governs intellectual property and legal disputes between the two companies. This legal framework contrasts with the competitive pressures AMD faces, as it notes in its risk factors that Intel's dominance in the microprocessor market and aggressive business practices limit AMD's ability to compete on a level playing field. Furthermore, in the Data Center and Client segments, AMD directly competes with Intel in CPUs and APUs, and acknowledges Intel as a primary rival in multiple product lines, including FPGA and Adaptive SoC server products. The cross-license agreement likely provides AMD with access to Intel's patent portfolio, which may help mitigate some legal risks, but does not neutralize Intel\u2019s market dominance or AMD\u2019s competitive challenges in key growth areas.",

In addition, we compete against Intel with our FPGA and Adaptiv e SoC serv er products. A v ariety of smaller fabless silicon companies offer proprietary accelerator solutions and Arm based CPUs targeting data center use-cases. In addition, some of our customers are internally dev eloping their own data center microprocessor products and accelerator products which could impact the av ailable market for our products.\n\n## Competition in Client Segment\n\nOur primary competitor in the supply of CPUs and APUs is Intel. A v ariety of companies prov ide or hav e dev eloped Arm-based microprocessors and platforms which could lead to further adoption of Arm-based PC solutions.\n\n## Competition in Gaming Segment\n\nIn the graphics market, our principal competitor in the supply of discrete graphics is NVIDIA, who is the discrete GPU market share leader, and Intel, who  manufactures  and  sells  integrated  graphics  processors  and  gaming-focused  discrete  GPUs.  With  respect  to  integrated  graphics,  higher  unit shipments  of  our APUs  and  Intel's  integrated  graphics  may  driv e  computer  manufacturers  to  reduce  the  number  of  systems  they  build  paired  with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost. We are the market share leader in semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical.\n\n## Competition in Embedded Segment\n\nWe expect continued competition from our primary FPGA competitors such as Intel, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and Microsemi Corporation, and from  ASSP  v endors  such  as  Broadcom  Corporation,  Marv ell  T echnology  Group,  Ltd.,  Analog  Dev ices,  T exas  Instruments  Incorporated  and  NX P Semiconductors N.V., and from Qualcomm Incorporated and NVIDIA. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. Intel is our main competitor for embedded CPUs. Other competitors include manufacturers of high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures; high-v olume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; high-speed, low-density CPLDs; high-performance DSP devices; products with embedded processors; products with embedded multi-gigabit transceiv ers; discrete general-purpose GPUs targeting data center and automotiv e applications; and other new or emerging programmable logic products.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nWe focus  our  research  and  dev elopment  (R&amp;D)  activ ities  on  designing  and  dev eloping  products.  Our  main  area  of  focus  is  on  deliv ering  the  next generation  of  processors  (CPU  and  GPU),  FPGAs  and  Adaptiv e  SoCs,  accelerators  (adaptiv e,  graphics  and  DPU),  SOMs  and  SmartNICs  and associated software. We focus on designing, with security in mind, new integrated circuits (ICs) with improv ed performance and performance-per-watt in advanced  semiconductor  manufacturing  processes,  the  design  of  logic  and  interface  IP,  adv anced  packaging  technologies,  and  heterogeneous integration  technologies.  We  also  focus  on  software  as  part  of  the  dev elopment  of  our  products,  including  design  automation  tools  for  hardware, embedded software, optimized software tools and libraries that extend the reach of our platforms to software and AI dev elopers. T hrough our R&amp;D efforts, we were able to introduce a number of new products and enhance our IP core offerings and software.\n\nWe also work with industry leaders on process technology, design tools, intellectual property, software and other industry consortia to conduct earlystage R&amp;D. We are also activ ely contributing to numerous industry open-source software initiativ es across a broad range of technologies. We conduct product and system R&amp;D activities for our products in the United States with additional design and dev elopment engineering teams located in v arious countries who undertake specific activ ities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters.",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company's product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers' prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products.\n\n## Market cycle\n\nThe 'semiconductor cycle' refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters.\n\n## Customers, sales and distribution\n\nWe sell our products to over 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than 40% of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100.\n\nWe market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and applications team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. For example, in 2021 about two-thirds of our revenue was direct, and transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of our revenue, as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n\nOur investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. We expanded the reach of our TI.com e-commerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. In addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments.\n\nWe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.\n\nWe invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage provides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced 300-millimeter capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300-millimeter wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200-millimeter wafer.",

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.\n\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:\n- i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n- ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.\n- iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n- iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.\n\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:\n\n- Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.\n- When we discuss our results:\n- Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.\n- New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.\n- From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the 'mix' of products shipped.",

          "chunk_text": "- Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.\n- For an explanation of free cash flow and the term 'annual operating tax rate,' see the Non-GAAP financial information section.\n- All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.\n\nOur results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussion of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations.\n\n## Results of operations\n\nOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 67.5% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300millimeter production.\n\nOur focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.76 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.29 billion and represented 34.3% of revenue. During 2021, we returned $4.41 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.\n\n## Details of financial results - 2021 compared with 2020\n\nRevenue of $18.34 billion increased $3.88 billion, or 27%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing.\n\nGross profit of $12.38 billion was up $3.11 billion, or 34%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 67.5% from 64.1%.\n\nOperating expenses (R&amp;D and SG&amp;A) were $3.22 billion compared with $3.15 billion.\n\nAcquisition charges were $142 million compared with $198 million and were non-cash.\n\nRestructuring charges/other was $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility partially offset by gains on sales of assets, compared with $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action in 2020.\n\nOperating profit was $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue, compared with $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue.\n\nOther income and expense (OI&amp;E) was $143 million of income compared with $313 million of income, which decreased primarily due to lower royalty income. See Note 11 to the financial statements.\n\nOur provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion compared with $422 million. This increase was due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2020, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position.",

      "answer": "The $893 million investment in the Lehi, Utah facility represents a significant capital outlay, with $526 million allocated to machinery and equipment alone, indicating a major bet on advanced manufacturing capabilities. The facility is strategically critical, as it operates in both the Analog and Embedded Processing segments, making it a dual-lever for growth across key business lines. However, the company highlights risks related to supply chain dependencies and the implementation of organizational changes, such as the integration of new manufacturing technologies and reliance on third-party suppliers for critical materials and equipment. These risks could delay or reduce the expected return on the Lehi investment, especially if disruptions occur or if the company fails to successfully integrate the facility into its broader operational strategy. Therefore, while the facility enhances production capacity and strategic positioning, its ROI is exposed to both operational execution risks and external supply chain vulnerabilities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations.\n\nFrom time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. For example, the purchase of our 300-millimeter semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah in 2021. If we do not successfully implement these changes, our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected. We may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations.\n\n## Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate.\n\nWe have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations. Climate change might exacerbate these occurrences or cause natural disasters to occur with greater frequency. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in the Properties section in Item 2, may adversely affect our results and financial condition.\n\n## Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products.\n\nRapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner. We make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed.\n\n## We face supply chain and manufacturing risks.\n\nWe rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our own or suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology.\n\nIn particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of our suppliers, require that certain key materials, natural resources, services and utilities be available. Suppliers of these items have and might continue to extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to factors beyond our control. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free.\n\nOur inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in manufacturing capacity, and we might not realize our expected return on those investments. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost-effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property.",

      "answer": "TI positions Embedded Processing Products as a key part of its long-term growth and competitive advantage strategy, emphasizing their role in strengthening the company\u2019s unique business model and generating long-term value. This strategic framing is supported by the fact that Embedded Processing contributed $3.05 billion in revenue in 2021, representing approximately 17% of total revenue, underscoring its materiality. Additionally, the products are defined as the digital 'brains' of many electronic systems, optimized for performance, power, and cost depending on the application, which aligns with TI\u2019s strategy to offer a broad portfolio that provides more value per customer. The integration of these products into customer systems, often requiring custom software investment, further supports long-term customer relationships and reinforces the strategic positioning outlined in the MD&A.",

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.\n\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:\n- i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n- ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.\n- iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n- iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.\n\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:\n\n- Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.\n- When we discuss our results:\n- Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.\n- New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.\n- From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the 'mix' of products shipped.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\n## Product information\n\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $14.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 77% of our revenue in 2021.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage references and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $3.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&amp;D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

      "answer": "From 2020 to 2021, the total assets in Texas Instruments' non-U.S. defined benefit plans increased from $3,008 million to $2,813 million, with a notable shift in allocation. In 2020, fixed income securities and cash equivalents totaled $2,278 million, while equity securities totaled $730 million. By 2021, fixed income dropped slightly to $2,220 million and equity securities decreased to $593 million. This suggests a minor rebalancing or market-driven value shift.

      "answer": "Cisco's available-for-sale debt investments declined in fair value from $15,592 million in fiscal year 2023 to $9,865 million in fiscal year 2024, a decrease of $5,727 million. During the same period, the company recorded a net loss of $67 million on these investments, up from a loss of $21 million in the prior year. This decline aligns with the sensitivity of these investments to interest rate fluctuations, as shown by the modeled valuations: a 150 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of these investments to $9,672 million in 2024 and $15,284 million in 2023, indicating that rising interest rates likely contributed to the observed drop in fair value.",

      "question": "How does Cisco's strategic positioning of its Observability Suite, as described in its product overview, align with its financial performance and revenue recognition model, particularly given the 27% year-over-year revenue growth in the Observability product category?",
      "answer": "Cisco's Observability Suite is positioned as a key component of its end-to-end visibility offerings, integrating with Splunk and AppDynamics to provide full-stack observability across applications, networks, and multi-cloud infrastructures. This strategic positioning aligns with the 27% year-over-year revenue growth in the Observability product category in fiscal 2024, indicating strong market adoption. The financial reporting further reveals that Observability Suite offerings, including Splunk, are primarily software-based with a mix of perpetual and term licenses, as well as SaaS arrangements. Revenue from perpetual software is recognized upfront, while term licenses and SaaS revenue are recognized over time, which affects cash flow timing and revenue visibility. This combination of strategic emphasis, growth metrics, and revenue recognition methodology reflects a deliberate shift toward scalable, software-driven observability solutions with recurring revenue characteristics.",

      "question": "How does Cisco's financial treatment of channel partner financing, including guarantees and receivables transfers, align with the risks highlighted around channel partner financial instability and the broader economic environment?",
      "answer": "Cisco facilitates third-party financing arrangements for channel partners, which include revolving short-term financing with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In some cases, Cisco guarantees a portion of these arrangements, with $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion subject to guarantees as of July 27, 2024, and July 29, 2023, respectively. These guarantees may result in Cisco being called upon to make payments in the event of nonpayment by channel partners, although historically such payments have been immaterial. Cisco derecognizes receivables upon transfer to third parties, as these qualify as true sales. However, the company faces risks related to the ability of channel partners to obtain financing, especially during periods of global credit market disruption or financial instability. These risks are compounded by macroeconomic challenges such as inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, which could negatively impact channel partner liquidity and, in turn, increase Cisco\u2019s exposure under these financing guarantees.",

      "answer": "Cisco's revenue recognition model for the Webex Suite aligns with its strategic positioning by reflecting the product's software-centric nature and long-term value. According to page 71, the Webex Suite falls under the Collaboration category, where perpetual software and hardware revenue is recognized upfront, while SaaS arrangements are recognized ratably over the contract term. This supports the strategic positioning described on page 5, which emphasizes the Webex Suite as a cloud-delivered, AI-enhanced solution for distributed teams, with end-to-end capabilities deployable from the cloud, on-premise, or in hybrid environments. Additionally, page 76 highlights Cisco's focus on innovation, including AI-driven productivity features, which aligns with the recurring revenue model for SaaS components, reinforcing the company's transition toward cloud-based offerings and long-term customer relationships.",

      "question": "How does Cisco's financial performance in the APJC region, as reflected in revenue and gross margin trends, align with its geographic segment structure and asset allocation patterns across recent fiscal years?",
      "answer": "Cisco's APJC segment reported $7,716 million in revenue and $5,187 million in gross margin in fiscal 2024, showing a decline from $8,417 million in revenue and $5,424 million in gross margin in fiscal 2023. This aligns with the company's geographic segment structure, which includes APJC as one of three primary regions, as noted in the financial statements. Additionally, the company's asset allocation for APJC increased slightly from $5,360 million at the start of fiscal 2023 to $5,382 million by the end of the fiscal year, indicating modest investment growth in the region despite the revenue decline.",

      "answer": "Adobe positions Sensei as a core cloud-hosted AI and machine learning framework that enables key features like automated photo-editing and optical character recognition, which are integral to the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings as stated in the MD&A section. This integration supports a seamless end-to-end workflow, justifying the ratably recognized revenue model for these offerings, as detailed in the financial notes. Additionally, Sensei is trademarked under Adobe\u2019s intellectual property, reinforcing its strategic importance and brand alignment with Adobe\u2019s broader product ecosystem. Together, these perspectives show that Sensei is not only a technological asset but also a monetizable and legally protected component central to Adobe\u2019s cloud strategy.",

      "answer": "Adobe accounts for Document Cloud subscriptions as a single performance obligation due to the deep integration between cloud-based and on-premise/on-device components, which aligns with its strategic vision of providing seamless, end-to-end document workflows. This integration is central to Adobe\u2019s positioning of Document Cloud as a platform that enhances productivity through intelligent features powered by Adobe Sensei, such as automated document tagging and responsive PDFs. KPMG\u2019s audit process specifically highlighted the subjective complexity in evaluating whether cloud services and software licenses are distinct, and they performed procedures including product demonstrations and interviews to validate Adobe\u2019s assertion that the integrated offering delivers the intended benefit only as a unified solution.",

      "question": "How does Adobe's strategic emphasis on Generative Credits in Creative Cloud subscriptions align with their commercial safety measures and usage limitations, and what does this imply about the product's role in customer monetization and retention strategies?",
      "answer": "Adobe strategically positions Generative Credits as a key differentiator within its Creative Cloud business to drive customer adoption, engagement, and monetization. On page 5, Adobe describes Generative Credits as a mechanism to increase the value of existing subscriptions, expand the customer base, and improve retention by offering AI-generated content capabilities through Adobe Firefly. These credits are embedded within a product-led growth strategy aimed at driving conversion, expansion, and loyalty. On page 12, Adobe explains that Firefly's generative AI model is trained on licensed and public domain content to ensure commercial safety, with Content Credentials providing transparency and trust\u2014an essential feature for professional users concerned with intellectual property. However, the same section notes a monthly usage limit for Generative Credits, beyond which users must purchase a Firefly paid subscription plan, indicating a monetization lever. On page 10, Adobe clarifies that Creative Cloud paid plans include a monthly allocation of Generative Credits, reinforcing their integration into the value proposition of premium offerings. Together, these perspectives reveal that Adobe is using Generative Credits not only to enhance creative workflows but also to create a recurring monetization touchpoint, where usage limits encourage incremental revenue while commercial safety assurances support broader customer acquisition. This aligns with Adobe\u2019s broader goal of growing a recurring and predictable revenue stream.",

      "question": "How does AMD's binding wafer supply agreement with GF through 2025, including minimum capacity commitments and prepayment obligations, reconcile with its strategic flexibility to engage other foundries and its exposure to supply chain disruptions documented in risk factors?",
      "answer": "AMD's wafer supply agreement with GF, as detailed in the risk factors (page 23), obligates GF to provide minimum annual capacity through 2025, with AMD committing to annual purchase targets and prepaying for wafers in 2022 and 2023. Failure to meet these targets could result in financial penalties and excess inventory, impacting gross margins. However, the agreement, amended in May and December 2021 (as disclosed in the exhibit list on page 97), removes exclusivity clauses, allowing AMD to work with other foundries. This flexibility is critical in mitigating supply chain risks, such as GF failing to meet capacity commitments, which could lead to shipment delays. Meanwhile, in the MD&A section (page 44), AMD notes that despite global supply chain disruptions from the pandemic, it secured additional capacity through long-term commitments and prepayments, including the GF amendment. This shows AMD is balancing contractual obligations with strategic adaptability to manage supply chain volatility and ensure production continuity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD (page_23) \u2192 Wafer Supply Agreement: AMD depends on GF under a binding agreement through 2025, with minimum capacity commitments and financial penalties if either party fails to meet obligations. This creates both supply assurance and financial risk.",
        "Hop 2: AMD (page_97) \u2192 Wafer Supply Agreement: The agreement is formally documented with amendments dated May and December 2021, removing exclusivity clauses and allowing AMD to work with other foundries, enhancing strategic flexibility.",
        "Hop 3: AMD (page_44) \u2192 Wafer Supply Agreement: AMD leveraged the GF agreement as part of a broader supply chain strategy during the pandemic, including prepayments and long-term commitments to secure capacity and support future growth."

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

We are also monitoring our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 also continues to impact the global supply chain, causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. Despite these challenges, we took action to maintain a stable supply of materials  to  meet  our  production  requirements  and  delivered  incremental  supply  throughout  the  year.  We  also experienced  strong  customer  demand  in  2021  and  made  strategic  investments  through  long-term  purchase commitments  and  prepayment  arrangements  in  our  supply  chain  to  secure  additional  capacity  to  support  future revenue growth. For example, we amended our Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) in May 2021 (the A&amp;R Seventh Amendment) and in December 2021 (the Amendment) to modify certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafer purchases at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes from December 23, 2021 and continuing through December 31, 2025. Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and we have corresponding annual wafer targets. We also agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and we are obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment does not affect any of the prior exclusivity commitments that were removed under the A&amp;R Seventh Amendment. We have full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node.\n\nDue to our strong financial results and growing cash flow generation, in May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (Repurchase Program) to purchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market. During the twelve months ended December 25, 2021, we repurchased 16.7 million shares of our common stock  under  the  Repurchase  Program,  for  a  total  cash  outlay  of  $1.8  billion. As  of  December  25,  2021,  $2.2  billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nAs  part  of  our  strategy  to  establish  AMD  as  the  industry's  high  performance  computing  leader,  we  announced  in October  2020  that  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  to  acquire  Xilinx,  Inc.  in  an  all-stock  transaction.  The completion  of  the  transaction  remains  subject  to  certain  closing  conditions,  including  regulatory  approval,  and  is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  based  upon  our  consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).  The  preparation  of  our  financial  statements  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  the  carrying  values  of  assets  and  liabilities.  Although  actual  results  have historically  been  reasonably  consistent  with  management's  expectations,  the  actual  results  may  differ  from  these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\n\nManagement believes the following  critical  accounting  estimates  are  the  most  significant  to  the  presentation  of  our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\n\nRevenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our OEM customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.\n\nWe base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.",

      "answer": "AMD maintained a $1.7 billion valuation allowance for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes, with the federal portion attributed to limitations under the Dual Consolidated Loss Rules, as disclosed in the tax section across multiple pages. In 2021, AMD recorded a $513 million income tax provision, a significant increase from the $1.2 billion tax benefit in 2020, primarily due to higher U.S. income and foreign taxes. Despite this improved financial performance, the company continued to carry a substantial valuation allowance, indicating that while current earnings have improved, there remains uncertainty about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, particularly those constrained by the Dual Consolidated Loss Rules.",

In  determining  taxable  income  for  financial  statement  reporting  purposes,  we  must  make  certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the  determination  of  the  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets  which  arise  from  temporary  differences  between  the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\n\nWe  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  that  we  will  be  able  to  recover  our  deferred  tax  assets.  Unless  recovery  is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is  more-likely-than-not  we  will  realize  our  deferred  tax  assets,  we  will  reverse  some  or  all  of  the  existing  valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\n\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;  (iii)  viable  and  prudent  tax  planning  strategies;  and  (iv)  future  taxable  income  exclusive  of  reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\n\nThrough  the  end  of  2021,  we  continue  to  maintain  a  valuation  allowance  of  approximately  $1.7  billion  for  certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multijurisdictional  tax  rules  and  the  potential  for  future  adjustment  of  our  uncertain  tax  positions  by  the  Internal  Revenue Service or other taxing authorities.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom.\n\nAdditional  information  on  our  reportable  segments  is  contained  in  Note  14 -Segment  Reporting  of  the  Notes  to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint  ventures  with  Higon  Information  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  a  third-party  Chinese  entity.  We  did  not  recognize  a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.\n\n## Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe  recorded  an  income  tax  provision  of  $513  million  in  2021  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.2  billion  in  2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers' compensation.\n\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the  U.S.  This  benefit  was  partially  offset  by  approximately  $10  million  of  withholding  tax  expense  related  to  crossborder transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n## International Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  portion  of  total  sales  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Substantially  all  of  our  sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  The  percentage  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held  domestically  was  91%  as  of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020.

      "answer": "AMD maintained a $1.7 billion federal valuation allowance in 2021 due to limitations under the Separate Return Loss Year Rules, among others (page_76). Despite this, the company recorded a $513 million income tax provision in 2021, reflecting higher U.S. income and foreign taxes (page_48), which suggests improved current-year profitability.

          "chunk_text": "A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nIncome  Taxes .  In  determining  taxable  income  for  financial  statement  reporting  purposes,  we  must  make  certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the  determination  of  the  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets  which  arise  from  temporary  differences  between  the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\n\nWe  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  that  we  will  be  able  to  recover  our  deferred  tax  assets.  Unless  recovery  is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is  more-likely-than-not  we  will  realize  our  deferred  tax  assets,  we  will  reverse  some  or  all  of  the  existing  valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.\n\nIn determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;  (iii)  viable  and  prudent  tax  planning  strategies;  and  (iv)  future  taxable  income  exclusive  of  reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\n\nThrough  the  end  of  2021,  we  continue  to  maintain  a  valuation  allowance  of  approximately  $1.7  billion  for  certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multijurisdictional  tax  rules  and  the  potential  for  future  adjustment  of  our  uncertain  tax  positions  by  the  Internal  Revenue Service or other taxing authorities.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom.\n\nAdditional  information  on  our  reportable  segments  is  contained  in  Note  14 -Segment  Reporting  of  the  Notes  to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of  the  year  than  in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  although  market  conditions  and  product  transitions  could  impact  these trends.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2021 and 2020:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion in 2021 increased by $453 million, or 46%, compared to $995 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint  ventures  with  Higon  Information  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  a  third-party  Chinese  entity.  We  did  not  recognize  a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.\n\n## Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe  recorded  an  income  tax  provision  of  $513  million  in  2021  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.2  billion  in  2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers' compensation.\n\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the  U.S.  This  benefit  was  partially  offset  by  approximately  $10  million  of  withholding  tax  expense  related  to  crossborder transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n## International Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  portion  of  total  sales  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Substantially  all  of  our  sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  The  percentage  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held  domestically  was  91%  as  of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.",

      "question": "Given AMD's dependency on third-party success for semi-custom SoC revenue, how does the lack of control over customer marketing efforts (as noted in risk factors) reconcile with the segment reporting that includes semi-custom SoC as a core part of the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and how might this impact the company's ability to meet forward-looking expectations tied to product demand and financial stability?",
      "answer": "AMD's semi-custom SoC revenue is directly tied to the success of third-party products that incorporate these chips, and the company explicitly states it has no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties. This lack of control introduces significant risk to revenue predictability, particularly since the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment explicitly lists semi-custom SoC products as a core offering. This dependency could directly impact AMD's ability to meet forward-looking expectations, such as those related to product demand and financial condition, especially if third-party product launches underperform. The segment reporting treats semi-custom SoC as a strategic and integral component, yet the risk disclosures emphasize the instability and lack of assurance in realizing expected revenue, creating a tension between strategic positioning and operational vulnerability.",

Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and  have  manufactured,  new  products  and  related  technologies  to  meet  evolving  industry  requirements,  at  prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target  markets.  As  consumers  have  new  product  feature  preferences  or  have  different  requirements  than  those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product  roadmap  includes  our  next-generation  AMD  Ryzen\u2122,  AMD  Radeon\u2122  and AMD  EPYC\u2122  processors.  We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause  us  to  lose  market  share  and  require  us  to  discount  the  selling  prices  of  our  products.  Although  we  make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully  implement  new  products  and  technologies  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  they  will  be  well-received  by  our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities  and  may  divert  our  limited  resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nDelays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers' product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems  or  products  until  at  least  the  next  design  configuration.  The  process  of  being  qualified  for  inclusion  in  a customer's system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers' platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in  the  demand  of  end-users,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business.  In  addition,  market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the  life  of  a  specific  product,  the  sale  price  is  typically  reduced  over  time.  The  introduction  of  new  products  and enhancements  to  existing  products  is  necessary  to  maintain  the  overall  corporate  average  selling  price.  If  we  are unable  to  introduce  new  products  with  sufficiently  high  sale  prices  or  to  increase  unit  sales  volumes  capable  of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers' products and the success of those products.\n\nThe  revenue  that  we  receive  from  our  semi-custom  SoC  products  is  in  the  form  of  non-recurring  engineering  fees charged to third parties  for  design  and  development  services  and  revenue  received  in  connection  with  sales  of  our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers' desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers' products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party's products and reflective of their  success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom  SoC  product  revenue  expected  by  us  may  not  be  fully  realized  and  our  operating  results  may  be adversely affected.",

The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\n\nOn June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP to the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more closely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax laws. The impact of  the  Domestication,  which  is  regarded  as  a  change  in  tax  status,  resulted  in  a  discrete  benefit  primarily  from  revaluing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $244 million in fiscal year 2022.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\n\nOur  effective  tax  rates  for  fiscal  years  2021  and  2020  were  lower  than  the  U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  of  21%  due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the  U.S.  federal  statutory  tax  rate,  recognition  of  U.S.  federal  research  tax  credits,  and  excess  tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.05 billion and $232 million of cumulative undistributed  earnings  held  by  certain  subsidiaries  in  Israel  and  the  United  Kingdom,  respectively.  We  have  not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\n\nAs  of  January  30,  2022  and  January  31,  2021,  we  had  a  valuation  allowance  of  $907  million  and  $728  million, respectively, related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $397 million, $345 million and $341 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $341 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $102 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.24 billion, of which $1.18 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $55 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for  changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization  of  federal,  state,  and  foreign  net  operating  losses  and  tax  credit  carryforwards  may  also  be  subject  to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign  tax  provisions.  If  any  such  limitations  apply,  the  federal,  state,  or  foreign  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $1.01 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $808 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $181 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $808 million of net unrecognized tax benefits as of January 30, 2022 consisted of $670 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $138 million reflected as a net reduction to the deferred tax assets.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment reported that CMP generated $550 million in fiscal year 2022, indicating its material contribution to the segment's 61% revenue growth. CMP is strategically positioned as a dedicated product for cryptocurrency mining, intended to channel miners away from gaming GPUs and toward a purpose-built solution. However, in the risk factors section, NVIDIA acknowledges the inherent unpredictability of cryptocurrency markets, including price volatility, regulatory shifts, and changes in mining technologies\u2014such as Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake\u2014which could reduce GPU-based mining demand and lead to increased returns or gray market activity. Furthermore, the company highlights long manufacturing lead times and the difficulty of forecasting demand in a volatile environment, which could result in inventory mismatches. This creates a tension: while CMP is being promoted as a revenue driver within the Compute & Networking segment, its success is highly contingent on unpredictable crypto market dynamics and NVIDIA's ability to accurately forecast production needs under extended lead times.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGraphics  Graphics  segment  revenue  increased  by  61%  in  fiscal  year  2022  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021.  We continue to benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during  fiscal  year  2022  resulted  from  a  combination  of  factors,  including:  the  ramp  of  new  RTX  30  Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nCompute &amp; Networking Compute &amp; Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, driven primarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud computing and workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical industries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong sales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP contributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\n\n## Concentration of Revenue\n\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location  to  which  the  products  are  initially  billed  even  if  the  revenue  is  attributable  to  end  customers  in  a  different location.\n\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost  of  semiconductors,  including  wafer  fabrication,  assembly,  testing  and  packaging,  board  and  device  costs, manufacturing  support  costs,  including  labor  and  overhead  associated  with  such  purchases,  final  test  yield  fallout, inventory  and  warranty  provisions,  memory  and  component  costs,  tariffs,  and  shipping  costs.  Cost  of  revenue  also includes  acquisition-related  costs,  development  costs  for  license  and  service  arrangements,  IP-related  costs,  and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\n\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022  was  primarily  due  to  lower  Mellanox  acquisition-related  charges,  including  a  non-recurring  inventory  step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also benefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute &amp; Networking.\n\nInventory  provisions  totaled  $354  million  and  $116  million  for  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  Sales  of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe gross  margin  of  our  Graphics  segment  increased  during  fiscal  year  2022  when  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021, primarily due to higher-end mix within GeForce GPUs.\n\nThe gross margin of our Compute &amp; Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year  2021,  primarily  due  to  a  shift  in  product  mix  and  partially  offset  by  a  reduced  contribution  from  Automotive solutions.",

Our  competitors'  products, services and technologies, such as the high-end discrete GPUs offered by Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which may result in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing  and  distribution  resources  than  we  do.  These  competitors  may  be  able  to  more  effectively  identify  and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such  customers  entails  the  transfer  of  IP  rights  that  may  enable  such  customers  to  develop  their  own  solutions  to replace those we are providing. If we are unable to successfully compete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline.\n\n## Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\n\n## If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand, and our financial results could be harmed.\n\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product releases and announcements, competing technologies, and other factors, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our products through channel partners, who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in response  to  changing  market  conditions  and  demand  for  our  products  could  impact  our  ability  to  properly  forecast demand.\n\nGPUs  have  use  cases  in  addition  to  their  designed  and  marketed  use  case,  such  as  for  digital  currency  mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand  for  our  products,  and  can  further  impact  our  ability  to  estimate  demand  for  our  products.  Changes  to cryptocurrency  standards  and  processes  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  pending  Ethereum  2.0  standard  may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased  the  supply  of  CMP  in  an  effort  to  address  demand  from  gamers  and  direct  miners  to  CMP.  However,  if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our gaming GPUs and limiting our ability to supply our gaming cards to  non-mining  customers.  We  cannot  predict  whether  our  strategy  of  using  LHR  cards  and  CMP  will achieve our desired outcome. In addition, our products may be resold on the unauthorized 'gray market,' which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products compete with our distribution channels.\n\nConsumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center, and workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand. These challenges may continue in the future when the effects of the pandemic subside.\n\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers' future demand. We have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of the worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory. Demand for  our  products  may  be  perishable  or  may  disappear,  which  would  make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause us to lose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished products and carry  inventory  for  anticipated  demand  that  does  not  materialize.  We  may  not  be  able  to  reduce  our  inventory purchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors. We may writedown our",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's exposure to manufacturing risks and product defects, as highlighted in their risk factors, reconcile with their strategic emphasis on securing design wins in automotive and AI platforms, and what implications does this have for the financial impact of inventory provisions tied to long lead times and uncertain demand forecasts?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA faces significant manufacturing and product defect risks, including potential losses from low yields, supply chain disruptions, and product recalls, which could harm their reputation and financial results (page 25). These risks are compounded by their reliance on design wins\u2014especially in fast-moving markets like Automotive and AI\u2014as a core part of their strategic growth (page 20). The company must forecast demand far in advance due to long manufacturing lead times (up to 12 months), often placing non-cancellable orders and paying premiums to secure supply (page 48). If design wins fail to convert into sustained revenue or if market conditions shift unexpectedly, NVIDIA could be left with excess or obsolete inventory, leading to costly write-downs that negatively impact gross margins, as seen by the 0.9% unfavorable margin impact in fiscal 2022. Thus, while design wins are critical for growth, they also heighten exposure to manufacturing and inventory risks that can materially affect financial performance.",

These  risks  may  increase  as  our  products  are  introduced  into  new  devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. An error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial  shipments  could  result  in  failure  to  achieve  market  acceptance,  loss  of  design  wins,  and  harm  to  our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers' perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field.  If  a  product liability  claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert  the  efforts  of  our  technical  and  management  personnel  and  harm  our  business.  Further,  our  business  liability insurance  may  be  inadequate  or  future  coverage  may  be  unavailable  on  acceptable  terms,  which  could  adversely impact our financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business\n\nWe  are  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties  associated  with  international  operations,  including  adverse economic conditions, which may harm our business.\n\nWe conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\n- domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business;\n- differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;\n- domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;\n- disruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and",

The  SEC's  website, http://www.sec.gov ,  contains  reports,  proxy  and  information  statements,  and  other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our web site and the information on it or connected to it are not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to,  the  risks  described  below. Any  one  of  the  following  risks  could  harm  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations  or  reputation,  which  could  cause  our  stock  price  to  decline,  and  you  may  lose  all  or  a  part  of  your investment.  Additional  risks,  trends  and  uncertainties  not  presently  known  to  us  or  that  we  currently  believe  are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets\n\nIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\n\nOur accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. These markets experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and industry standards.\n\nOur strategic and business success depends on our ability to:\n\n- timely  identify  emerging  industry  changes,  and  develop  new  or  enhance  existing  products,  services  and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets;\n- expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\n- accurately forecast demand in our businesses;\n- meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change;\n- manage product, software, and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;\n- develop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including related to our acquisitions, customer support, ecommerce and IP licensing capabilities; and\n- complete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.\n\nWe make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop new products,  services  and  technologies,  or  if  they  do  not  become  widely  adopted,  our  business,  revenue,  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nAchieving design wins, which is important to our success in several businesses, may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability  to  anticipate  features  and  functionality  that  customers  will  demand.  Unanticipated  changes  in industry  standards  or  disruptive  technological  innovation  could  render  our  products  incompatible  with  products developed by other companies. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry and safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. Furthermore, a design win does not guarantee revenue.\n\nWe  cannot  ensure  that  our  strategic  direction  will  result  in  products  and  technologies  that  provide  value  to  our customers and partners. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, our business will be harmed.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn our Automotive platform, we unveiled the NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan next-generation SOC; announced design wins with Mercedes-Benz for the AI cockpit in its new EQS sedan; with Volvo Cars for the autonomous driving computer in its next-generation cars, beginning with the XC90 in 2022; with energy vehicles from R-Auto, IM Motors, NIO, Faraday Future,  VinFast  and  Xpeng;  with  robotaxis  including  Cruise,  Amazon  Zoox,  Pony.ai  and  AutoX;  with  autonomous trucking  companies Embark, Kodiak Robotics and Plus; formed a multi-year partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to jointly develop and deliver next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled services and experiences; and announced that Desay, Flex, Quanta, Valeo and ZF are using the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform to manufacture safe and secure AV systems for vehicle makers.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial  statements,  which  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the United  States,  or  U.S.  GAAP.  The  preparation  of  these  financial  statements  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and judgments  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  cost  of  revenue,  expenses  and  related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nWe  believe  the  following  critical  accounting  policies  affect  our  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  our  Board  of  Directors.  The  Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable  value  or  for  obsolete  or  excess  inventory.  Most  of  our  inventory  provisions  relate  to  excess  quantities  of products  or  components,  based  on  our  inventory  levels  and  future  product  purchase  commitments  compared  to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\n\nSituations  that  may  result  in  excess  or  obsolete  inventory  include  changes  in  business  and  economic  conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing  products  or  inconsistent  spikes  in  demand  due  to  unexpected  end  use  cases,  failure  to  estimate  customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\n\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable  impact  of  0.9%  in  fiscal  year  2022  and  insignificant  in  fiscal  year  2021.  As  a  fabless  semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times are very  long  and  in  some  cases,  extend  on  to  be  twelve  months  or  longer,  which  requires  us  to  make  estimates  of customers' future demand. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\n\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is",

      "answer": "NVIDIA reported $185 million in long-lived assets in Israel as of January 30, 2022, indicating a meaningful physical or operational presence in the country. This aligns with the company's broader international property strategy, as noted in its facilities overview, which includes owned and leased properties in Israel for data centers, R&D, and administrative functions. Furthermore, Israel is referenced in the tax section as one of the jurisdictions where NVIDIA earns income subject to lower tax rates compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate, suggesting that the company benefits from a favorable tax environment in Israel, which complements its asset deployment and operational footprint in the region.",

We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.\n\n## Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\n\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us to dedicate  a  substantial  portion  of  our  cash  flows  from  operations  towards  debt  service  obligations  and  principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and restrict our  ability  to  grant  liens  on  property,  enter  into  certain  mergers,  dispose  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets,  or materially change our business.\n\nWe are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing.\n\n## Delaware  law  and  our  certificate  of  incorporation,  bylaws  and  agreement  with  Microsoft  Corporation  could delay or prevent a change in control.\n\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult  for  a  third  party  to  acquire  a  majority  of  our  outstanding  voting  stock. These  provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to develop and sell graphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\n\n## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur headquarters is in Santa Clara, California. We own and lease approximately 1.76 million square feet of office and building  space  for  our  corporate  headquarters.  We  have  a  new  building  at  our  Santa  Clara  campus  which  was completed in February 2022. In addition, we lease data center space in Santa Clara, California. We also own and lease facilities  for  data  centers,  research  and  development,  and/or  sales  and  administrative  purposes  throughout  the  U.S. and  in  various  international  locations,  primarily  in  Asia,  Israel,  and  Europe.

Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\n\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense  was  $236  million  and  $184  million  in  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  The  increase  in  expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.\n\nOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in nonaffiliated  entities.  Refer  to  Note  9  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  IV,  Item  15  of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe increase in  our  effective  tax  rate  in  fiscal  year  2022  as  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021  was  primarily  due  to  an increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's strategic shift away from non-strategic hardware products impact the trajectory of hardware support contracts, considering their revenue recognition model and the expected customer renewal behavior for those contracts?",
      "answer": "Oracle's strategic shift away from non-strategic hardware products has led to reduced sales volumes in certain hardware product lines, which in turn has negatively impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold (page 51). These contracts are typically priced as a percentage of net hardware product fees and are recognized as revenue ratably over the contract term (page 43). Given that hardware support contracts are optional and subject to customer renewal decisions, the decline in new hardware sales could lead to a contraction in future support revenue unless renewal rates or contract values increase significantly (page 73).",

        "Hop 1: [ORCL](page_51) \u2192 [Hardware Support Contracts]: Hardware support contract volumes are declining due to reduced emphasis on non-strategic hardware products and lower sales volumes, contributing to constant currency hardware revenue declines in the Americas and EMEA.",

Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to continue to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including i ndependent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also i nclude product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.\n\nWe generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the i ncremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.\n\nOur quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners' abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts; and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n\n## Services Business\n\nOur services business, which represented 10% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers' IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. We acquired certain companies and technologies during fiscal 2024 and 2023, including Cerner in fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional i nformation related to our acquisition of Cerner and our other recent acquisitions.

There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and increased the estimate of the useful lives from four years to five years effective at the beginning of fiscal 2023. Based on the carrying value of our servers as of May 31, 2022, this change in accounting estimate decreased our total operating expenses by $434 million during fiscal 2023.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur sources of revenues include:\n\n- cloud and license revenues, which include: cloud services revenues; cloud license and on-premise license revenues; and license support revenues, which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;\n- hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage products, and industryspecific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and\n- services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting and advanced customer services.\n\nCloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Services offerings, which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.\n\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer's option.\n\nLicense support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\n\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware. Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.\n\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's strategic emphasis on expanding Oracle Cloud Services to small and medium-sized businesses reconcile with the increased effective tax rate of 19.2% in fiscal 2024 and the financial structure of its cloud and license business, where revenues are recognized ratably over multi-year terms?",
      "answer": "Oracle's forward-looking strategy emphasizes expanding Oracle Cloud Services (OCS) to small and medium-sized businesses due to the platform's low-touch, cost-effective design (page 3). However, the financial structure of the cloud and license business, which recognizes revenues ratably over contract terms (typically one to four years), creates a mismatch between cash flow and taxable income (page 49). This is further complicated by the increased effective tax rate of 19.2% in fiscal 2024\u2014up from a base rate of 10.9%\u2014due to adjustments related to stock-based compensation and intangible asset amortization (page 49). Meanwhile, page 72 clarifies that OCS includes both SaaS and OCI offerings, which are central to Oracle's integrated cloud strategy. The combination of deferred revenue recognition and higher effective tax rate suggests that while Oracle is strategically pushing OCS adoption, the financial benefits\u2014especially from a tax and profitability standpoint\u2014may lag or be diluted in the near term, requiring careful capital allocation and investment to sustain growth.",

We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud based deployments). Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which had no material impact to our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto for the year ended May 31, 2024.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.

Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one to four years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and onpremise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure software license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and i nternationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings and marketing program costs.",

These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud based deployments). Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which had no material impact to our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto for the year ended May 31, 2024.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.

We have two families of server products: those based on the Oracle SPARC microprocessor, which are designed to be differentiated by their reliability, security and scalability, specifically for UNIX environments; and those using x86 microprocessors. By offering a range of server sizes and microprocessors, customers have the flexibility to choose the types of servers that they believe will be most appropriate and valuable for their IT environments.\n\n## Oracle Storage\n\nOracle storage products are engineered for cloud, on-premise and hybrid IT environments and designed to securely archive, back up, manage and protect customers' mission-critical data assets. Oracle storage products combine flash, disk, tape and server technologies with optimized software and unique i ntegrations with the Oracle Database offering greater performance and efficiency and lower total cost relative to our competitors' storage products. Certain of our storage products provide integration with Oracle Cloud Services for backup and archiving.\n\n## Oracle Industry-Specific Hardware Offerings\n\nWe offer hardware products and services designed for certain specific industries, including, among others, our point-of-sale terminals and related hardware that are designed for managing businesses within the food and beverage, hospitality and retail industries; hardware products for the healthcare industry; and hardware products and services for communications networks, including network signaling, routing and policy control and subscriber data management solutions for 5G technology.\n\n## Oracle Operating Systems, Virtualization, Management and Other Hardware-Related Software\n\nWe offer a portfolio of operating systems, including Oracle Linux and Oracle Solaris, virtualization software and other hardware-related software. We also offer a range of management technologies and products, including Oracle Enterprise Manager and the Oracle Cloud Observability and Management platform, designed to help customers efficiently operate complex IT environments, including both end users' and service providers' cloud environments.\n\n## Oracle Hardware Support\n\nOracle hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products such as for Oracle operating systems and firmware. These offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. We continue to evolve hardware support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of net hardware products fees.\n\n## Oracle Services\n\nWe offer services to help customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our expertise in Oracle technologies, extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings substantially include, among others:\n\n\u00b7 consulting services, which are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our cloud and license offerings, including IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, implementation, integration, application development, security assessments and ongoing software enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners, which involves the use of consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; and\n\n\u00b7 advanced customer services, which are support services provided by Oracle to a customer to enable increased performance and higher availability of a customer's Oracle products and services.",

We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, reliability, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors; facilitating the ease with which organizations are able to deploy, use, manage and maintain our offerings; and i ncorporating emerging technologies such as AI within our offerings to enable leaner business processes, automation and innovation. For example, our Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure as an OCI offering that uses machine learning capabilities to automate many traditionally manual functions.\n\nAfter an initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us.\n\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings and i ncrease stockholder value. We have invested billions of dollars over time to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services.

Oracle technologies are based upon industry standards and are designed to be enterprise-grade, reliable, scalable and secure. Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and services, are the building blocks of Oracle Cloud Services, our partners' cloud services and our customers' cloud IT environments. Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings are marketed and sold through our cloud and license and hardware businesses, and are delivered through the Oracle Cloud or through other IT deployment models, including cloud-based, hybrid and on-premise deployments.\n\nWe believe that our Oracle Cloud Services offerings are opportunities for us to continue to expand our cloud and license business. We believe that our customers increasingly recognize the value of access to the latest versions of Oracle cloud-based applications and infrastructure capabilities via a lower cost, rapidly deployable, flexible and interoperable services model that Oracle provisions, manages, upgrades and maintains on our customers' behalf. We believe that we can market and sell our Oracle Cloud Services offerings together to help new and existing customers migrate their extensive installed base of on-premise and cloud-based applications and infrastructure technologies to the Oracle Cloud and we believe we are in the early stages of what we expect will be a material migration of our existing Oracle customer base from on-premise applications and infrastructure products and services to the Oracle Cloud. In addition, we also believe we can market our Oracle Cloud Services offerings to a broader ecosystem of small and medium-sized businesses, non-IT lines of business purchasers, developers and partners due to the highly available, intuitive design, ease of access, low touch and low cost characteristics of the Oracle Cloud.\n\nIn recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud deployment models has increased.

Business\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include onpremise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments), such as Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region offerings (instances of Oracle Cloud in a customer's own data center) and multicloud options that enable customers to use Oracle Cloud in conjunction with other public clouds. Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force or indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations, including, for example, an artificial intelligence (AI) product company that uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to build and serve generative AI models; a global technology company that uses OCI to power its logistics and mobile application offerings; a multinational financial institution that runs its banking applications using Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for its accounting processes, risk management, supply chain and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle SaaS and OCI (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Oracle Cloud Services integrate the IT components, including software, hardware and services, in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for customers and that customers may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.\n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interoperability and extensibility to easily move workloads among the Oracle Cloud and other IT and cloud environments; cost-effective by lowering upfront customer investments and i mplementing usage-based resource consumption costs; and highly secure, standards-based and reliable.\n\nOracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n\nOracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n\nOracle also offers professional services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services.\n\nProviding choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer's transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we invested $8.9 billion, $8.6 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services.

Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n\n\u00b7 Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:\n\no cloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements generally: are billed in advance of the cloud services being delivered; have durations of one to four years; are renewed at the customer's option; and are recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over ti me; and o l i cense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or onpremise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year.",

We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud based deployments). Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which had no material impact to our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto for the year ended May 31, 2024.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically",

Business\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include onpremise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments), such as Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region offerings (instances of Oracle Cloud in a customer's own data center) and multicloud options that enable customers to use Oracle Cloud in conjunction with other public clouds. Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force or indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations, including, for example, an artificial intelligence (AI) product company that uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to build and serve generative AI models; a global technology company that uses OCI to power its logistics and mobile application offerings; a multinational financial institution that runs its banking applications using Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for its accounting processes, risk management, supply chain and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle SaaS and OCI (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Oracle Cloud Services integrate the IT components, including software, hardware and services, in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for customers and that customers may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.\n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interoperability and extensibility to easily move workloads among the Oracle Cloud and other IT and cloud environments; cost-effective by lowering upfront customer investments and i mplementing usage-based resource consumption costs; and highly secure, standards-based and reliable.\n\nOracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n\nOracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n\nOracle also offers professional services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services.\n\nProviding choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer's transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we invested $8.9 billion, $8.6 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nWe begin Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding significant assumptions and j udgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fi s cal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi s cal year ended May 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on June 20, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise IT needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\n\n## Cloud and License Business\n\nOur cloud and license business, which represented 84% and 83% of our total revenues in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n\n\u00b7 Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:\n\no cloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements generally: are billed in advance of the cloud services being delivered; have durations of one to four years; are renewed at the customer's option; and are recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over ti me; and o l i cense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or onpremise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year.",

      "answer": "Cisco's maximum potential future payments under financing guarantees stood at $1.2 billion as of July 27, 2024, down from $1.7 billion in the prior year, indicating a reduced exposure. In the MD&A section, Cisco affirms that its liquidity position, supported by cash, investments, and access to capital markets, is sufficient to meet obligations including these guarantees. Operationally, Cisco facilitates $27.1 billion in channel partner financing volume annually, with guarantees representing a small portion of this, suggesting that while the guarantees are a formal liability, they are managed within a broader framework of routine financing support and assessed as non-material in terms of payment risk.",

Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.\n\nLong-Term Debt The  amount  of  long-term  debt  in  the  preceding  table  represents  the  principal  amount  of  the  respective  debt  instruments.  See  Note  12  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTransition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act ('the Tax  Act').\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income tax es payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income tax es payable of approximately $1.7 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $76 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Commitments\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments. The funding commitments were $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 27, 2024 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.\n\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under 'Financing Receivables and Guarantees.'\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.",

Business\n\n## General\n\nCisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that help to power, secure, and draw insights from the Internet. We are integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our product portfolios across networking, security, collaboration and observability to simplify how our technology is delivered, managed and optimized and to help customers maximize the business value of their technology investments and accelerate their digital transformation.\n\nWe conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into the following three geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur products and technologies are grouped into the following categories: Networking, Security, Collaboration and Observability. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of services offerings, including technical support services and advanced services, also known as lifecycle services. Our customers include businesses of all sizes, public institutions, governments, and service providers, including large webscale providers. These customers often look to us as a strategic partner to help them use information technology (IT) to differentiate themselves and drive positive business outcomes.\n\nWe were  incorporated  in  California  in  1984  and  reincorporated  in  Delaware  in  2021.  Our  headquarters  are  in  San  Jose,  California.  The  mailing  address  of  our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Our website is www.cisco.com. Through a link on the Investor Relations section of our website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at sec.gov: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. All such filings are available free of charge. The information published on our website, or any other website referenced herein, is not incorporated into this report.\n\n## Strategy and Priorities\n\nAcross the globe, businesses and organizations of every size are leveraging Cisco technology to transform and drive better outcomes and experiences. We also help customers navigate emerging technological shifts. Our strategy is to securely connect everything to make those desired outcomes and experiences possible for our customers.\n\nIn today's dynamic environment, our customers have three key priorities: build modern and resilient infrastructure; protect against the cyber threats of today and tomorrow; and harness the power of AI and data.\n\nThese customer priorities are central to how we innovate and develop our technology. First, we provide the underlying network connectivity for our customers, whether they are connecting traditional branch offices, data centers, smart grids, video devices, electric vehicles, or other devices. Second, we help protect those network connections and the underlying technology architecture against cyber threats. Third, through the visibility we have into data across the network, connected devices and applications, we provide context and insights to our customers about what is happening in their technology architecture, not only in their on-premise infrastructure and private data centers, but also their cloud infrastructure. Our ongoing innovation is delivered, managed and optimized through a combination of hardware, software and subscriptions, in line with the flex ible consumption models our customers request.",

      "question": "Given APJC's 13% product revenue decline and $8.2 billion balance sheet contribution, how does Cisco justify maintaining it as a core geographic segment despite market challenges in key countries like China and India?",
      "answer": "Cisco's APJC segment, which includes key markets like China (down 35%) and India (down 17%), experienced a 13% product revenue decline in fiscal 2024 according to the performance analysis on page 40. Despite this underperformance, the segment maintained a significant balance sheet presence, growing from $5.38 billion to $8.21 billion in assets during the fiscal year as shown on page 76. According to the segment reporting framework on page 104, Cisco's internal management system evaluates geographic segments based on specific financial metrics while excluding certain corporate-level expenses. This suggests that although APJC is facing current market challenges, its substantial asset base and strategic positioning in the region may still justify its classification as a core geographic segment within Cisco's global operational structure.",

Our  Observability offerings are designed to bring together and provide end-to-end visibility of our customer's environments across applications, networks, multi-cloud infrastructures and the Internet, to help deliver full stack observability for modern environments and drive relevant real-time insights. These offerings enable organizations to see, understand, and improve every digital ex perience and assure seamless connectivity for their modern digital environments. Our network assurance offering, ThousandEyes, is a network intelligence platform that provides in-depth visibility into network and internet performance. Our Observability Suite offering, including Splunk Observability and AppDynamics, provides complete visibility across the full stack from infrastructure to applications as well as the digital customer ex perience.\n\n## Services\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers. Our support and maintenance services help our customers ensure their products operate efficiently, remain available, and benefit from the most up-to-date system and application software. These services help customers protect their network investments, manage risk, and minimize downtime for systems running mission-critical applications.\n\nWe also provide comprehensive advisory services that are focused on responsive, preventive, and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs. We are investing in and expanding advisory services in the areas of software, cloud, security, and analytics, which reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes.  We are focused on three priorities:  utilizing  technology  advisory  services  to  drive  higher  product  and  services;  assessment  and  migration  services providing the tools, expertise and methodologies to enable our customers to migrate to new technology platforms; and providing optimization services aligned with customers' business expectations. We are also embedding AI assistants and automated functions into our services to drive productivity.\n\n## Customers and Markets\n\nMany factors influence the  IT,  collaboration,  and  networking  requirements  of  our  customers.  These  include  the  size  of  the  organization,  number  and  types  of technology systems, geographic location, and business applications deployed throughout the customer's network. Our customer base is not limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. Our customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, public sector and service provider and cloud.\n\n## Enterprise\n\nEnterprise includes businesses that are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices, or mid-market and small businesses. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. Our mid-market and small business customers typically require the latest advanced technologies, but with less complexity. We offer service and support packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily through our service provider partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as selling directly to these customers.\n\n## Public Sector\n\nPublic  Sector  includes  federal,  state  and  local  governments,  as  well  as  educational  institution  customers.  Many  public  sector  customers  have  unique  IT, collaboration,  and  networking  needs  within  a  multi-vendor  environment.  We  sell  to  public  sector  customers  through  a  network  of  third-party  application  and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as through direct sales.\n\n## Service Provider and Cloud\n\nService Provider and Cloud includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers and webscale operators, as well as internet, cable, and wireless providers. We also include media, broadcast, and content providers within this customer market, as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional network-based, content-based and application-based services. This customer market offers data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses, governments, utilities, and consumers worldwide. Service provider and cloud businesses use a variety of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.",

SA is offered under volume licensing programs like Enterprise Agreements and conveys rights to new software and upgrades, along with support and training, either as a required or optional component (page_16). From a revenue recognition standpoint, SA is treated as a distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, reflecting the ongoing benefits customers receive (page_62).

Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner adv isors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and serv ices directly to customers, such as cloud serv ices, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and serv ices indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, v alue-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other v olume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Prov ider is our main partner program for reselling cloud serv ices.\n\nWe distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusiv e distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Indiv idual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our dev ices through third-party retailers. We hav e a network of field sales representativ es and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and prov ide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners prov iding v ertical solutions and specialized serv ices.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations of v arying sizes that want to purchase our cloud serv ices and on-premise software. We license these organizations under v olume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and serv ices instead of hav ing to acquire separate licenses through retail channels.

We enter into contracts that can include v arious combinations of products and serv ices, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Rev enue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to gov ernmental authorities.\n\n## Nature of Products and Services\n\nLicenses for on-premises software prov ide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made av ailable to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which prov ide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration ov er which the customer benefits from the software. Rev enue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate rev enue to software updates, primarily because the updates are prov ided at no additional charge, rev enue is recognized as the updates are prov ided, which is generally ratably ov er the estimated life of the related dev ice or license.\n\nCertain v olume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance ('SA'). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released ov er the contract period and prov ides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Rev enue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably ov er the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receiv e benefits, giv en that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied ov er time.\n\nCloud serv ices, which allow customers to use hosted software ov er the contract period without taking possession of the software, are prov ided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Rev enue related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably ov er the contract period. Revenue related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud serv ices require a significant lev el of integration and interdependency with software and the indiv idual components are not considered distinct, all rev enue is recognized ov er the period in which the cloud serv ices are prov ided.\n\nRevenue from search adv ertising is recognized when the adv ertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the rev enue has been completed. Revenue from consulting serv ices is recognized as serv ices are prov ided.\n\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and rev enue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including rev enue by significant product and serv ice offering.\n\n## Significant Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and serv ices to a customer. Determining whether products and serv ices are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately v ersus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based serv ice includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud serv ices, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud serv ice and recognized ov er time. Certain cloud serv ices, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant lev el of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud serv ices, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Rev enue from Office 365 is recognized ratably ov er the period in which the cloud serv ices are prov ided.",

Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not av ailable, the inv estment is not priced by our pricing v endors, or when a broker price is more reflectiv e of fair v alues in the market in which the inv estment trades. Our broker-priced inv estments are generally classified as Lev el 2 inv estments because the broker prices these inv estments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced inv estments hav e a sufficient lev el of trading v olume to demonstrate that the fair v alues used are appropriate for these inv estments. Our fair v alue processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair v alues are recorded. These controls include model v alidation, rev iew of key model inputs, analysis of period-ov er-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nCash from operations increased $31.0 billion to $118.5 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to an increase in cash receiv ed from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $6.2 billion to $37.8 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $5.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $3.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $2.0 billion increase in div idends paid. Cash used in inv esting increased $74.3 billion to $97.0 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $67.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets and a $16.4 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\n\n## Debt Proceeds\n\nWe issue debt to take adv antage of fav orable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 11 - Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10K) for further discussion.\n\n## Unearned Revenue\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned rev enue related to v olume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance ('SA') and cloud serv ices. Unearned rev enue is generally inv oiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably ov er the cov erage period.

We enter into contracts that can include v arious combinations of products and serv ices, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Rev enue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to gov ernmental authorities.\n\n## Nature of Products and Services\n\nLicenses for on-premises software prov ide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made av ailable to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which prov ide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration ov er which the customer benefits from the software. Rev enue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate rev enue to software updates, primarily because the updates are prov ided at no additional charge, rev enue is recognized as the updates are prov ided, which is generally ratably ov er the estimated life of the related dev ice or license.\n\nCertain v olume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance ('SA'). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released ov er the contract period and prov ides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Rev enue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably ov er the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receiv e benefits, giv en that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied ov er time.\n\nCloud serv ices, which allow customers to use hosted software ov er the contract period without taking possession of the software, are prov ided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Rev enue related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably ov er the contract period. Revenue related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud serv ices require a significant lev el of integration and interdependency with software and the indiv idual components are not considered distinct, all rev enue is recognized ov er the period in which the cloud serv ices are prov ided.\n\nRevenue from search adv ertising is recognized when the adv ertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the rev enue has been completed. Revenue from consulting serv ices is recognized as serv ices are prov ided.\n\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and rev enue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including rev enue by significant product and serv ice offering.\n\n## Significant Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and serv ices to a customer. Determining whether products and serv ices are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately v ersus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based serv ice includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud serv ices, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud serv ice and recognized ov er time. Certain cloud serv ices, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant lev el of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud serv ices, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Rev enue from Office 365 is recognized ratably ov er the period in which the cloud serv ices are prov ided.",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, ev idence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included ev aluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as ev aluating the ov erall presentation of the financial statements. We believ e that our audits prov ide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) inv olv ed our especially challenging, subjectiv e, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, prov iding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or serv ices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receiv e in exchange for those products or serv ices. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and serv ices, including cloud-based serv ices, in its customer agreements through its v olume licensing programs.",

Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.\n\nOur growth depends on securely deliv ering continuous innov ation and adv ancing our leading productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices, including Microsoft 365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365. Microsoft 365 is an AI first platform that brings together Office, Windows, Copilot, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees. Copilot for Microsoft 365 combines AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications. Microsoft Teams is a comprehensiv e platform for communication and collaboration, with meetings, calling, chat, file collaboration, and the ability to bring all of the applications teams use into a single place. Microsoft Viv a is an employee experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights.\n\nTogether, the Microsoft Cloud, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, and our AI offerings bring a new era of collaborativ e applications for ev ery role and business function to get insights and business impact faster. Dynamics 365 is a portfolio of intelligent business applications that deliv ers operational efficiency and breakthrough customer experiences. Our role-based extensions of Microsoft Copilot - Copilot for Sales, Copilot for Serv ice, and Copilot for Finance - bring together the power of Copilot for Microsoft 365 with role-specific insights and workflow assistance to streamline business processes. Copilot Studio allows customers to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own Copilot. Microsoft Power Platform helps domain experts driv e productiv ity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, v irtual agents, and business intelligence. Copilot Pro is a consumer subscription serv ice that offers faster and more powerful AI assistance in Microsoft 365 apps and on the web. LinkedIn combines our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way professionals learn, sell, market, and get hired.\n\n## Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform\n\nDigital transformation and adoption of AI continues to rev olutionize more business workstreams for organizations in ev ery sector across the globe. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the v ery core of products and serv ices. We continue to inv est in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft serv ices prov ided by our network of cloud computing and AI infrastructure and datacenters.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate div erse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improv ing the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud prov ides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improv ing time to v alue, reducing costs, and increasing agility. As the foundation of the Microsoft Cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, dev eloper productiv ity, data and AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.\n\nWe offer supercomputing power for AI at scale to run large workloads, complemented by our rapidly expanding portfolio of AI cloud serv ices and hardware, which includes custom-built silicon and strong partnerships with chip manufacturers. We hav e introduced purpose-built cloud infrastructure for AI workloads including a custom AI accelerator, Azure Maia, and a custom in-house central processing unit, Azure Cobalt.",

The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for rev enue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price ('SSP') of performance obligations, v ariable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair v alue of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful liv es of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market v alue of, and demand for, our inv entory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achiev ed for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that hav e been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for inv estments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful liv es of our serv er and network equipment. Due to inv estments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our serv er and network equipment, as well as adv ances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful liv es of both serv er and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effectiv e beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Rev enue and expenses are translated at av erage rates of exchange prev ailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensiv e income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct rev enue includes sales from operating systems, cross-dev ice productiv ity and collaboration applications, serv er applications, business solution applications, desktop and serv er management tools, software dev elopment tools, v ideo games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent dev ices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other rev enue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that prov ide customers with software, serv ices, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting serv ices.

We continue to identify and ev aluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our serv er capacity to meet the ev olv ing needs of our customers, particularly giv en the growing demand for AI serv ices. Our datacenters depend on the av ailability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and serv ers, including graphics processing units ('GPUs') and other components.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we hav e the ability to use other manufacturers if a current v endor becomes unav ailable or unable to meet our requirements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy &amp; Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X  and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North A merica, EM EA  (Europe, M iddle East and A frica) and Growth M arkets. We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and A I with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world's leading organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance services-creating tangible value at speed and scale.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of A ccenture plc, an Irish company, and our controlled subsidiary companies. A ccenture plc is an Irish public limited company, which operates its business through its subsidiaries.\n\nThe shares of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than us are treated as noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling interests were less than 1% as of A ugust 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAll references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on A ugust 31. For example, a reference to 'fiscal 2024' means the 12-month period that ended on A ugust 31, 2024. A ll references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe account for revenue in accordance with FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\n\n## Performance Obligations\n\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606. A  contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margins for similar services sold on a standalone basis. While determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate performance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other performance obligations. Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration. If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately. If the modified services are not distinct, they  are accounted for as part of the ex isting contract.\n\nOur revenues are derived from contracts for managed services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology integration consulting services. These contracts have different terms based on the scope, performance obligations and complexity of the engagement, which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, fee-pertransaction contracts and contracts with multiple fee types.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. M any contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the",

These variable amounts generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metrics, milestones or cost targets and can be based upon client discretion. We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur. These estimates reflect the expected value of the variable fees and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time.\n\nOur performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. The majority of our revenues are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligations. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the services to be provided.\n\n## Managed Services Contracts\n\nOur managed services contracts typically span several years. Revenues are generally recognized on managed services contracts over time because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed. M anaged services contracts require us to provide a series of distinct services each period over the contract term. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms.\n\n## Technology Integration Consulting Services\n\nRevenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new or enhanced systems and related processes for our clients are recognized over time as control of the system is transferred continuously to the client. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Generally, revenue, including estimated fees, is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client.\n\n## Non-Technology Integration Consulting Services\n\nOur contracts for non-technology integration consulting services are typically less than one year in duration. Revenues are generally recognized over time as our clients benefit from the services as they are performed, or the contract, for which the related services lack an alternative use, includes termination provisions enabling payment for performance completed to date. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. For non-technology integration consulting contracts which do not qualify to recognize revenue over time, we recognize revenues at a point in time when the client obtains control of the promised good or service.\n\n## Contract Estimates\n\nEstimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored over the lives of our contracts, and recorded revenues and cost estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a technology integration consulting contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in Receivables, Contract assets, and Deferred revenues (Contract liabilities) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. In limited circumstances, we agree to extend financing to certain clients. The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones. When the period between payment and transfer of goods or services is one year or less, we do not assess the existence of, and therefore, do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component. Our receivables are rights to consideration that are conditional only upon the passage of time as compared to our contract assets, which are rights to consideration conditional upon additional factors. When we bill or receive payments from our clients before revenue is recognized, we record Contract liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.",

A s we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.\n\nTechnological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud, data and A I solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced, in whole or in part, some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation and making strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies to our current offerings that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions have had and could in the future have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our managed services contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. M any of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. A dditionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of rev enues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties related to the development and use of A I could harm our business, damage our reputation or give rise to legal or regulatory action.\n\nWe are increasingly applying A I-based technologies, including generative A I, to our services and solutions, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",

      "question": "How has Accenture's issuance, repurchase, and dividend treatment of Class A Ordinary Shares collectively impacted shareholders' equity balances and cash flow positioning in fiscal 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's capital return strategy?",
      "answer": "Accenture's Class A Ordinary Shares activity in fiscal 2024 included share repurchases totaling $4.11 billion (12.18 million shares), offset partially by new issuances of 7.97 million shares for employee programs, which contributed $841.7 million to cash flow. Additionally, the company declared quarterly dividends, including a $1.48 per share dividend in September 2024, which cumulatively reduced retained earnings by $2.56 billion. These actions collectively decreased shareholders' equity by $4.11 billion from repurchases and $2.45 billion from dividends, while new issuances added $1.35 billion. This reflects a capital return strategy focused on disciplined shareholder returns through both buybacks and dividends, while maintaining flexibility through employee equity programs.",

      "answer": "ACN's GrowthMarkets segment reported an operating income of $1,840 million in fiscal 2024, maintaining a consistent 16% operating margin compared to the prior year. However, revenues from GrowthMarkets decreased by 2% in U.S. dollars to $11.3 billion in fiscal 2024 from $11.5 billion in fiscal 2023, while local currency showed a 7% increase. Additionally, the company incurred $121,515 million in business optimization costs in GrowthMarkets in fiscal 2024, down from $160,174 million the previous year. This suggests that while cost management efforts may have improved efficiency, the region's revenue contraction in USD terms poses a challenge to its overall profitability contribution despite stable margins.",

      "answer": "Salesforce has access to a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility under the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which it may use for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions (page_84). During fiscal 2023 and 2024, the company repurchased $4.0 billion and $7.6 billion of its common stock, respectively, under its Share Repurchase Program (page_53). Despite having no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2024, Salesforce faces debt-related risks, including the potential impact of future borrowing needs, covenant compliance, and the effect of adverse economic conditions on its ability to service debt (page_30). This suggests that while the company has not drawn on the facility, it maintains the option to do so, which could support future repurchases or acquisitions, but such actions would increase exposure to debt-related risks outlined in the risk factors.",

      "answer": "CRM identifies global tax developments\u2014including the Inflation Reduction Act and OECD's Pillar Two global minimum tax\u2014as key factors that could materially impact its effective tax rate and financial results (page_29). These developments are further highlighted in the company's list of factors affecting operating results, where changes in tax laws or global tax developments applicable to multinational corporations are explicitly called out as influencing financial performance (page_32). Additionally, the company's financial risks section directly references unanticipated changes in the effective tax rate and global tax developments as top-tier risks that could affect its financial stability and cash flows (page_14). Together, these three sections indicate that CRM views evolving international tax frameworks as a multi-dimensional risk with implications for tax compliance, cash flow predictability, and global operational strategy.",

      "answer": "Salesforce disclosed that 60 million shares were available for future grant or issuance under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan as of January 31, 2024. This plan is actively used in compensation, as evidenced by its inclusion in share-based compensation charges related to workforce reductions during restructuring. Additionally, formal equity agreements under the Amended and Restated 2013 Equity Incentive Plan are documented and filed, indicating the plan's ongoing significance in the company's equity compensation strategy. Together, these perspectives show that the plan remains a core mechanism for employee incentives, both in regular operations and during organizational changes.",

      "question": "How does Salesforce's strategic investment in technology startups align with its financial risk exposure and broader ecosystem expansion strategy, particularly given the concentration risk in enterprise cloud companies and the reinvestment of proceeds from prior investments?",
      "answer": "Salesforce's strategic investment in technology startups is a core part of its broader ecosystem expansion strategy, as noted on page 9, where it emphasizes reinvesting proceeds from prior strategic investments to continue growing its portfolio. This aligns with the concentration risk disclosed on page 69, where Salesforce reveals that as of January 31, 2024, two privately held investments\u2014primarily in enterprise cloud companies and technology startups\u2014represented 16% of its total strategic investment portfolio. On page 23, the company acknowledges the speculative nature of these investments, particularly in early-stage technology startups, and the potential for partial or complete loss of invested capital. Together, these perspectives show that while Salesforce sees technology startups as critical to expanding its solution ecosystem and driving innovation, it also faces material financial risk from volatility in valuations and liquidity events, which could impact its consolidated financial results.",

      "answer": "Adobe utilizes collateral security agreements in conjunction with its foreign exchange contracts to manage credit risk exposure by requiring the exchange of cash collateral when the net fair value of derivatives fluctuates beyond set thresholds. As of November 29, 2024, Adobe had $5.89 billion in total notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts, with maturities extending through September 2026. These agreements are integrated into the company's broader hedging strategy, which includes both cash flow hedges and non-designated hedges, and are reflected on the balance sheet with collateral posted included in prepaid expenses and collateral received in accrued expenses. The agreements support Adobe\u2019s structured risk management approach by ensuring counterparty performance amid currency volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "\nAs of November 29, 2024, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts were $5.89 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $2.73 billion in Euros, $791 million in Japanese Y en, $714 million in British Pounds, $609 million in Indian Rupees, $585 million in Australian Dollars, $386 million in Canadian dollars and $76 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 29, 2024, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through September 2026. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 29, 2024. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $434 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $434 million.\n\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For ex ample, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have longterm investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $1.19 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Expenses\n\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased forward contracts or option contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, Japanese Y en, British Pounds, Australian Dollars and Canadian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to 24 months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\n\nWe record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or operating expenses, as applicable.

We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses primarily in Euros, Japanese Y en, British Pounds, Indian Rupees, Australian Dollars and Canadian Dollars. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.\n\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. G ains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair value through earnings.\n\nGains and losses related to changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each period as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses and Treasury lock agreements are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency revenue, foreign currency expense or Treasury lock cash flow hedge to revenue, operating expense or interest expense, as applicable.\n\n## Concentration of Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fix ed-income investments, structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.\n\nOur investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy. Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of credit risk ex ists with respect to these investments.\n\nWe enter  into  master  netting  arrangements  to  mitigate  credit  risk  in  derivative  transactions  by  permitting  net  settlement  of  transactions  with  the  same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.\n\nCredit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and require letters of credit or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments from their customers.  Certain  contracts  with  advertising  agencies  contain  sequential  liability  provisions,  under  which  the  agency  is  not  required  to  pay  until  payment  is received from the agency's customers. In these circumstances, we evaluate the credit-worthiness of the agency's customers in addition to the agency itself. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the customer's ability and intention to pay is not probable, the arrangement is not considered to be a revenue contract. Accordingly, we will not recognize any consideration received as revenue until termination or substantive completion of the services.",

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nWe may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.\n\nWe enter  into  master  netting  arrangements  to  mitigate  credit  risk  in  derivative  transactions  by  permitting  net  settlement  of  transactions  with  the  same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to 24 months. As of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $5.51 billion and $2.83 billion, respectively, hedging ex posures denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Indian Rupees, Australian Dollars and Canadian Dollars.\n\nIn June 2019, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion  of  our  future  debt  issuance.  These  derivative  instruments  hedged  the  impact  of  changes  in  the  benchmark  interest  rate  to  future  interest payments and were settled upon debt issuance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We incurred a loss related to the settlement of the instruments which is amortized to interest ex pense over the term of our debt due February 1, 2030. See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, we had net derivative gains on our foreign currency cash flow hedges expected to be recognized within the next 36 months, of which $64 million of net gains are ex pected to be recognized into revenue within the nex t 12 months and $1 million of net losses are ex pected to be recognized into operating expenses within the next 12 months. We also had net derivative losses on our Treasury lock agreements, of which $3 million is expected to be recognized into interest expense within the next 12 months.\n\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective  in  offsetting  changes  to  future  cash  flows  on  hedged  transactions.  We  record  changes  in  fair  value  of  these  cash  flow  hedges  in  accumulated  other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency revenue, foreign currency expense or Treasury lock cash flow hedge to revenue, operating expense or interest ex pense, as applicable. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the same income statement line item as the hedged item. We evaluate hedge  effectiveness  at  the  inception  of  the  hedge  prospectively,  and  on  an  ongoing  basis  both  retrospectively  and  prospectively.  If  we  do  not  elect  hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no net gains or losses recognized in income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\n\n## Non-Designated Hedges\n\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related contracts.",

      "answer": "The 2024 Performance Share Program builds on Adobe's structured equity compensation framework, as evidenced by its formal adoption under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and the detailed vesting conditions tied to both relative total stockholder return and revenue-based financial metrics over a three-year period. This reflects a strategic alignment with long-term shareholder value and performance-based incentives. Concurrently, the company's deferred compensation liabilities, which stood at $297 million as of November 29, 2024, highlight the broader financial obligations Adobe carries in supporting long-term employee retention mechanisms. The program's vesting conditions, which allow for 0% to 200% of the target shares based on performance, demonstrate a risk-adjusted approach to equity compensation, balancing reward potential with financial discipline.",

For equity award elections, distributions are made in stock in the form of a lump sum payment only.\n\nCertain deferred compensation is invested in money market and other mutual funds and subsequently recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with corresponding unrealized holding gains and losses recorded as investment gains (losses) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Undistributed deferred compensation is recorded as other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, the invested amounts under the plan totaled $283 million and $206 million, respectively. As of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, undistributed deferred compensation due to participants totaled $297 million and $222 million, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 12.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nOur stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-based compensation plans and programs:\n\n## Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Programs\n\nWe grant restricted stock units and performance share awards to eligible employees under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan ('2019 Plan'). Restricted stock units generally vest over four years. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the 'ECC').\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, we had reserved 69.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2019 Plan and had 34.3 million shares available for grant.\n\nOur  Performance  Share  Programs  aim  to  help  focus  key  employees  on  building  stockholder  value,  provide  significant  award  potential  for  achieving outstanding company performance and enhance our ability to attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. The ECC approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology. In January 2024, the ECC approved the 2024 Performance Share Program.\n\nShares outstanding under our 2024, 2023 and 2022 Performance Share Programs may be earned based on the achievement of (i) an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period, as well as (ii) revenue-based financial metrics measured over three one-year performance periods. Each type of performance goal is weighted 50% and achievement of each performance goal is determined independently of the other. Shares associated with each performance goal are not awarded until the corresponding performance targets are defined.\n\nPerformance share awards in each of our 2024, 2023 and 2022 Performance Share Programs will cliff-vest upon the later of (i) the three-year anniversary of the earliest vesting commencement date in the respective Performance Share Program, or (ii) the ECC's certification of the level of achievement of the final performance period in the respective Performance Share Program, contingent upon the participant's continued service. Participants can earn between 0% and 200% of the target number of performance shares.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, the shares awarded under our 2024, 2023 and 2022 Performance Share Programs remained outstanding and unvested.\n\n## Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nOur Employee Stock Purchase Plan ('ESPP') allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of twenty-four-month offering periods with four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. If the market value of our common stock at the end of a purchase period is lower than the market value at the beginning of the offering period, participants are rolled over into the subsequent offering, resulting in a reset of the offering price and the twenty-four month offering period.",

We aim to achieve this goal by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth to allow our customers to create content and interact with documents in ways that are more frictionless, efficient and accessible, and meeting our customers' needs holistically to increase the value they derive from our services.\n\nWe are redefining the creative process with Adobe Creative Cloud to unleash everyone's ability to imagine and express ideas. We are empowering enterprises and users beyond creative professionals, such as novice content creators and communicators, to create, edit, schedule and share content quickly and easily using Adobe Express, which makes select capabilities from products like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Acrobat easy to use for users at any level. With Adobe Acrobat Pro, subscribers have full convert and edit capabilities, advanced e-signature features including bulk send and custom branding, advanced protection and additional PDF features. We continue to add collaboration capabilities into our flagship products, Apps and workflows, and to infuse AI into our creative Apps to help our customers and users work faster and smarter, with new models for images and vector graphics, and AI-powered video features natively integrated into our flagship products. We are building our own foundation models in areas where we have domain expertise and which we believe are most relevant to our customers, and partnering with third-party AI models and large language models to further expand the capabilities of our products. We expanded Adobe Firefly with the launch of Adobe Firefly Services, which help organizations automate content production; Custom Models, which enable enterprises to train and customize models to support brand consistency amongst creative and marketing teams; Firefly V ideo Model (public beta), which enables generative text-to-video and image-tovideo; and Firefly Image 3 Foundation Model, which allows for faster and higher-quality image generations. Developing our own foundation models enables us to design Firefly to be commercially safe and in line with our AI Ethics principles of accountability, responsibility and transparency.\n\nWe continue to pursue ways to inspire, empower and connect the creative community and support live, interactive tutorials with creators.

      "answer": "Adobe's customer journey management capabilities, primarily delivered through its Digital Experience segment, play a critical role in driving Document Cloud's 18% year-over-year revenue growth. The Digital Experience segment, which includes Adobe Experience Cloud apps like Adobe Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, and Adobe Journey Optimizer, enables businesses to manage, test, target, and personalize customer journeys across B2B and B2C use cases. These tools provide actionable data in real time, allowing for highly tailored and adaptive experiences across platforms. This data-driven approach is leveraged within Adobe\u2019s own go-to-market strategy, as the company explicitly states it uses Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to 'raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention' in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings. Additionally, Adobe has implemented a data-driven operating model (DDOM) that integrates customer journey insights to optimize marketing strategies and subscription growth. This cross-product synergy\u2014where Digital Experience tools inform and enhance Document Cloud customer acquisition and retention\u2014directly supports the Document Cloud's growth to $3.18 billion in fiscal 2024, up 18% from fiscal 2023.",

As we execute on our long-term growth initiatives, with focus on delivering product innovation and driving adoption and usage of our AI-powered solutions, we have continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings.\n\n## Digital Media\n\nIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile applications ('apps') and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive 3D experiences. Creative Cloud offers Adobe Acrobat Pro, our comprehensive PDF solution, integral to creative workflows and used by creators worldwide as part of our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription and on a standalone basis. In addition, Adobe Express is our web and mobile app designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud also includes Adobe Firefly, a group of creative generative AI models designed to generate high quality images and text effects. Adobe Firefly-powered generative AI features are also available across Creative Cloud apps including Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Express. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users' devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\n\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as generative AI capabilities. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with existing users, continue to attract new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\n\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new and enhanced desktop, web and mobile apps, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements ('ETLAs'), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.\n\nWe are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, collaborate, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type.  Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes subscriptions to Adobe Acrobat Pro and Standard, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. Certain Adobe Acrobat products are also offered as perpetual licenses which are immaterial to our business. In April 2024, we introduced Acrobat AI Assistant, a generative AI-powered product designed to deliver insights and enhance productivity through interactive document experiences, which is available as an add-on subscription to our Adobe Acrobat Pro and Standard and Adobe Acrobat Reader products.\n\nAs part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model ('DDOM') and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, which continue to contribute strong product-led growth in the business.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's application of business combination accounting rules affect the recognition of cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2021 across its GAAP financials, segment reporting, and management reconciliation, and what are the implications for revenue expectations in renewal periods?",
      "answer": "Oracle applied business combination accounting rules to acquisitions closed prior to fiscal 2022, which resulted in adjustments to cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2021. Specifically, these revenues were not recognized in GAAP-based consolidated financial statements (page_50), but were included in operating segment results for reporting to CODMs (page_50). Additionally, Oracle estimated the fair values of assumed cloud services and license support contracts, which meant that the full revenue amounts from these contracts were not recognized in fiscal 2021 but were expected to be recognized over renewal periods (page_48). Furthermore, management reporting for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 included these revenues, even though they were excluded from consolidated operations, and a reconciliation was provided to align segment revenues with total reported revenues (page_106). This divergence between internal and external reporting frameworks indicates Oracle's expectation of future revenue recognition as contracts are renewed, while maintaining GAAP compliance in consolidated statements.",

Our products and services include  enterprise  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  that  are  delivered  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and interoperable  IT  deployment  models.  These  models  include  on-premise  deployments,  cloud-based  deployments,  and  hybrid deployments  (an  approach  that  combines  both  on-premise  and  cloud-based  deployment)  such  as  our  Oracle  Cloud@Customer offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer's  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our customers  and  facilitate  the  product,  service  and  deployment  combinations  that  best  suit  our  customers'  needs.  Our  customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build,  deploy,  run,  manage  and  support  their  internal  and  external  products,  services  and  business  operations  including,  for example, a global cloud applications developer that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to power its software-as-a-service (SaaS)  offerings;  a  multi-national  financial  institution  that  runs  its  banking  applications  using  the  Oracle  Exadata  Database Machine;  and  a  global  consumer  products  company  that  leverages  Oracle  Fusion  Cloud  Enterprise  Resource  Planning  for  its accounting processes, consolidation and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle Cloud Services offerings, which include Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings, provide comprehensive and integrated applications and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models.  Oracle  Cloud  Services  integrate  the  IT  components, including software, hardware and services, on a customer's behalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for the customer and that a customer may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.\n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standardsbased and reliable.\n\nOracle  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\n\nOracle  hardware  products  include  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage  and  industry-specific  products,  among  others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\n\nOracle also offers services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.\n\nProviding  choice  and  flexibility  to  Oracle  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and  better  addresses  customer  needs  relative  to  our  competitors,  many  of  whom  provide  fewer  offerings,  more  restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer's transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we invested $7.2 billion, $6.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another including through the use of OCI to power our Oracle Fusion SaaS Applications, which we and our customers use to run internal business processes.

We  offer applications that are deployable to meet several business automation requirements across a broad range of industries. We also offer industry-specific  applications,  which  provide  solutions  to  customers  in  the  automotive,  communications,  construction  and engineering, consumer goods, energy and water, financial services, food and beverage, government and education, healthcare, high technology, hospitality, industrial manufacturing, life sciences, media and entertainment, oil and gas, professional services, retail, travel and transportation, and wholesale distribution industries, among others.\n\n## Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)\n\nOracle's broad spectrum of Oracle Cloud SaaS offerings provides customers a choice of software applications that are delivered via a  cloud-based  IT  environment  that  we  deploy,  manage,  upgrade  and  support,  and  that  customers  purchase  by  entering  into  a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.

There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur sources of revenues include:\n\n- cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud licenses and onpremise licenses, which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;\n- hardware  revenues,  which  include  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and\n- services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting and advanced customer services.\n\nLicense  support  revenues  are  typically  generated  through  the  sale  of  license  support  contracts  related  to  cloud  license  and  onpremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\n\nCloud  services  revenues  include  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  deliver  applications  and  infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.\n\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, onpremise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer's option.\n\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer  servers,  storage,  and  industry-specific  hardware.  Our  hardware  support  offerings  generally  provide  customers  with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.\n\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services.",

      "answer": "Oracle positions license support contracts as a strategic enabler that reinforces both customer retention and the broader product ecosystem. Financially, license support contracts are a major revenue component, with 'substantially all' customers electing to purchase or renew them annually, indicating strong recurring revenue characteristics (page 74). From a service perspective, these contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software upgrades, maintenance releases, and technical support, which are offered at the customer's option and priced as a percentage of the net license fees (page 73). Strategically, Oracle integrates license support into their broader applications portfolio, offering it alongside Oracle Applications such as E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, and JD Edwards, which are designed to manage core business functions across enterprise domains. This integration supports Oracle\u2019s goal of creating a comprehensive, connected business process environment in the cloud, reinforcing customer stickiness and long-term engagement with Oracle\u2019s platform (page 9).",

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOracle Corporation provides products and services that substantially address all aspects of enterprise information technology (IT) environments, including applications and infrastructure technologies. We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based, Cloud@Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer's own data center), on-premise and hybrid models. Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide a comprehensive and integrated  stack  of  applications  and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models  that  Oracle  develops, deploys, hosts, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and  hardware  products  and  related  services  to  manage  their  own  cloud-based  or  on-premise  IT  environments.  Customers  that purchase  our  software  licenses  may  elect  to  purchase  license  support  contracts,  which  provide  our  customers  with  rights  to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated  financial  statements  included  our  accounts  and  the  accounts  of  our  wholly-  and  majority-owned  subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as  a  component  of  non-operating  expenses  or  income,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges that are more fully described in Note 16 below. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2021 was impacted by a $2.3 billion net income tax benefit related to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Refer to Note 13 below for additional information regarding our income taxes.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes; and ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , neither of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2022.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth  in  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon",

      "question": "How does AMD's cross-segment positioning of APUs in both client and embedded computing markets reflect their broader strategy of leveraging core technology across platforms for economies of scale?",
      "answer": "AMD's strategy emphasizes reusing core technology across platforms to achieve economies of scale, and this is clearly reflected in their cross-segment positioning of APUs. In the Client segment, APUs are highlighted as key components in desktop, notebook, and handheld personal computers, where they combine CPU and GPU capabilities for performance, efficiency, and modern security features (page_6). In the Embedded segment, APUs are part of a broader portfolio that includes CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoCs, targeting markets like healthcare, automotive, and industrial applications (page_70). This reuse of APU technology across different market verticals aligns with AMD's stated strategic pillar of leveraging core technology across platforms (page_6), allowing them to maximize development efficiency and scale production across both client and embedded computing applications (page_5).",

      "question": "How do Adaptive SoCs support AMD's strategic focus on high-performance and adaptive computing across data centers, embedded systems, and AI applications as outlined in their 10-K?",
      "answer": "Adaptive SoCs play a central role in AMD's strategy to deliver high-performance and adaptive computing solutions across diverse markets. As stated in the strategy section (page_6), AMD leverages Adaptive SoCs as part of its data center offerings, alongside CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators, to meet the performance demands of cloud, AI, and ML environments. This aligns with AMD's strategic reuse of core technology across platforms to achieve economies of scale. Additionally, the company is a leader in adaptive and embedded computing, offering Adaptive SoCs for healthcare, automotive, industrial, storage, and networking markets, demonstrating their cross-sector importance. The design platforms section (page_11) elaborates that Adaptive SoCs feature a heterogeneous processing subsystem with integrated programmable hardware, ideal for embedded systems requiring real-time control, analytics, and sensor fusion. These capabilities enable customers to implement domain-specific architectures and accelerate innovation. Finally, the product listing section (page_5) confirms that Adaptive SoCs are a core product category within AMD's embedded segment, alongside FPGAs and SOMs, further reinforcing their strategic role in enabling flexible, high-performance computing solutions. Together, these perspectives show that Adaptive SoCs are a key component of AMD\u2019s strategy to diversify revenue and deliver adaptable, high-performance computing platforms across multiple industries.",

      "question": "How does AMD's dependency on third-party product success for semi-custom SoC revenue, as highlighted in risk factors, align with their strategic emphasis on timely product development and the segment-level classification of these products under Gaming?",
      "answer": "AMD's semi-custom SoC products are strategically important but pose risk due to dependency on third-party success, as noted in the risk factors section, which states that revenue from these products depends on their incorporation into customers' products and the success of those products in the market. This aligns with the company's strategic emphasis on timely product development, where delays can cause missed design windows and loss of market share, as described in the product development section. Furthermore, the Gaming segment specifically includes semi-custom SoC products and development services, indicating their importance to this business area. Therefore, the risk, strategy, and segment perspectives together show that while semi-custom SoC products are a key part of AMD's Gaming segment, their success is highly contingent on external factors beyond AMD's control, making them both a strategic opportunity and a risk exposure.",

        "Hop 1: AMD (page_18) \u2192 Semi-Custom SoC Products: Risk factors highlight that revenue from semi-custom SoC products depends on third-party product success, and AMD has no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties.",
        "Hop 2: AMD (page_26) \u2192 Semi-Custom SoC Products: Product development strategy emphasizes the importance of timely introduction of products, noting that delays can cause missed design windows and negatively impact revenue, especially for products like semi-custom SoCs that depend on customer platform launches.",
        "Hop 3: AMD (page_70) \u2192 Semi-Custom SoC Products: Segment reporting shows that semi-custom SoC products are part of the Gaming segment, indicating their strategic importance to this business area and that their performance directly affects segment-level results."

      "question": "How does AMD's reliance on AIB partners, as outlined in the risk factors, operational dependencies, and inventory management sections, expose the company to financial and strategic risks, particularly in light of price protection clauses, termination rights, and compatibility challenges?",
      "answer": "AMD faces a multi-dimensional risk exposure from its reliance on AIB partners. From a risk factor perspective (page_19), the company is exposed to the risk of AIB partners terminating agreements, prioritizing competitors, or failing to market AMD products effectively, which could materially affect revenue. Operationally (page_29), AMD depends on AIBs to support its products, and any disruption in this support could hinder product adoption and sales. Financially (page_30), AMD offers price protection rights to AIB partners, meaning a significant price decline could reduce revenue and gross margins. Additionally, compatibility issues (page_30) could further reduce AIB partner confidence and product demand, compounding financial and strategic risks.",

        "Hop 1: [AMD](page_19) \u2192 [AIB Partners]: Risk factor highlights that AIB partners can terminate agreements or prioritize competitors, directly impacting AMD\u2019s ability to bring products to market.",
        "Hop 2: [AMD](page_29) \u2192 [AIB Partners]: Operational dependency on AIBs is emphasized, noting that their support is critical for product success and that agreements are non-exclusive, increasing partner risk.",
        "Hop 3: [AMD](page_30) \u2192 [AIB Partners]: Financial exposure is outlined through price protection clauses, which could materially reduce revenue and gross margins during price declines, compounding the risk from earlier sections."

      "question": "How does Broadcom's integration and valuation of VMware Cloud Foundation reflect in its financial commitments, intangible asset methodology, and product portfolio positioning?",
      "answer": "Broadcom has committed $2,900 million in purchased intangible assets for the VMware merger, of which $1,380 million was recognized in fiscal year 2024, with the remainder expected to be recognized through fiscal year 2025 and into 2026. This aligns with the valuation methodology applied to VMware Cloud Foundation, where developed technology was assessed using the multi-period excess earnings method, factoring in projected cash flows and economic useful life. Additionally, VMware Cloud Foundation is prominently positioned in Broadcom\u2019s product matrix as a core private cloud platform, integrated alongside offerings like Tanzu and VeloCloud, indicating strategic emphasis on its role within the broader infrastructure and cloud solutions portfolio.",

We valued the developed technology using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the developed technology less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash fl ows over the forecast period.\n\nCustomer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of products to existing customers of VMware. Customer contracts and related relationships were valued using the with-and-without-method under the income approach. In the withand-without method, the fair value was measured by the difference between the present values of the cash flows with and without the existing customers in place over the period of time necessary to reacquire the customers. The economic useful life was determined by evaluating many factors, including the useful l i fe of other intangible assets, the length of time remaining on the acquired contracts and the historical customer turnover rates.\n\nTrade name relates to the 'VMware' trade name. The fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the trade name. The economic useful life was determined based on the expected life of the trade name and the cash flows anticipated over the forecast period.\n\nOff-market component of customer contracts relate to rebates and marketing development funds provided to customers prior to the VMware Merger. We valued these contracts based on their remaining unamortized balances, which approximate their fair value. The economic useful life was determined based on the remaining terms of customer contracts.\n\nThe fair value of IPR&amp;D was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach.

Our infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology ('IT') environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Broadcom,' 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries. We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and i nfrastructure software. See Note 13. 'Segment Information' for additional information.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'). The VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53,398 million. VMware was a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all applications, enabling digital innovation with enterprise control. We acquired VMware to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of VMware commencing on November 22, 2023. See Note 4. 'Acquisitions' for additional information.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31. Our fiscal year ended November 3, 2024 ('fiscal year 2024') was a 53-week fiscal year, with the first fiscal quarter containing 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ended October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023') and fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ('fiscal year 2022') were both 52-week fiscal years.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, we completed a ten-for-one forward stock split of our common stock through the filing of an amendment ('Amendment') to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Amendment proportionately increased the number of shares of our authorized common stock without changing the par value of $0.001 per share. All share, equity award and per share amounts and related stockholders' equity balances presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the stock split.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.\n\n## BROADCOM INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Our over 60-year history of innovation dates back to our diverse origins from AT&amp;T/Bell Labs, Lucent and Hewlett-Packard Company, and evolved with LSI Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade Communications Systems LLC, CA, Inc., Symantec Enterprise Security, and VMware, Inc. ('VMware'). Over the years, we have assembled a large team of semiconductor and software design engineers around the world. We maintain design, product and software development engineering resources at locations in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Israel, providing us with engineering expertise worldwide. We combine global scale, engineering depth, broad product portfolio diversity, superior execution and operational focus to deliver category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.\n\nWe develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor ('CMOS') based devices and analog III-V based products. We offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, including artificial intelligence ('AI') networking and connectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes ('STB'), broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We differentiate ourselves through our high-performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing semiconductor products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins.\n\nOur infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology ('IT') environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Many of the largest companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500, and many government agencies rely on our software solutions to help manage and secure their on-premises and hybrid cloud environments, private cloud infrastructure and AI data centers. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security, making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems i ncorporating multiple semiconductor products.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'), in which VMware stockholders received, in aggregate, approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53.4 billion. We funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger consideration with net proceeds from the issuance of $30.4 billion in term loans under a credit agreement that we entered into on August 15, 2023, as well as cash on hand. Following the VMware Merger, we sold VMware's end-user computing business to KKR &amp; Co. Inc. for cash consideration of $3.5 billion, after working capital adjustments. With the VMware Merger, we have bolstered our infrastructure software solutions and are able to offer our customers a greater capacity to address complex IT infrastructure issues.\n\n## Business Strategy\n\nOur strategy is focused on technology leadership and category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions delivering a comprehensive suite of innovative infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies, as well as extensive internal research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology market l eadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.\n\n## Products and Markets\n\n## Semiconductor Solutions\n\nSemiconductors are made by imprinting a network of electronic components onto a semiconductor wafer. These devices are designed to perform various functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively filtering electronic signals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and storing data. Our digital and mixed signal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors offering fast switching speeds and low power consumption, which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also offer analog products, which are based on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency ('RF'), and optoelectronic applications. III-V refers to elements from the 3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are gallium arsenide ('GaAs') and indium phosphide ('InP').",

      "question": "How does Broadcom's use of the 2023 Term Loans for the VMware acquisition, the associated interest rate exposure, and the subsequent repayments impact its liquidity position and strategic flexibility for future capital needs?",
      "answer": "Broadcom raised $30,390 million through the 2023 Term Loans to fund the VMware acquisition, which significantly increased its debt obligations. These loans carry floating interest rates, and a 100 basis point increase would raise interest expenses by $137 million annually, adding pressure to interest costs amid rising rates. Despite this, Broadcom repaid $16,795 million of the 2023 Term Loans during fiscal 2024, signaling a commitment to manage leverage. However, with $13.6 billion still outstanding and increased capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2025, the company must balance servicing this debt with funding strategic initiatives, including potential acquisitions, while relying on operating cash flows and its $7.5 billion credit facility to maintain liquidity and flexibility.",

The $1,877 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to contributions from VMware. The $8,187 million decrease in net income was largely driven by $13,058 million higher non-cash adjustments including amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and deferred taxes and other non-cash taxes related to the VMware Merger.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions, proceeds from the sale of a business, capital expenditures, and proceeds and payments related to investments. The $22,381 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to a $25,925 million increase in cash used for acquisitions due to the VMware Merger and the acquisition of Seagate's SoC operations, net of cash acquired, offset in part by $3,485 million proceeds from the sale of the EUC business.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds and payments related to our long-term borrowings, dividend payments, stock repurchases, and employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards. The $13,890 million increase in cash flows from financing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $39,954 million of net proceeds from the 2023 Term Loans and the issuance of senior notes, offset in part by a $19,205 million increase in payments on debt obligations, a $3,355 million increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards, a $2,169 million increase in dividend payments, and a $1,352 million increase in stock repurchases.\n\n## ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nFrom time to time, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates, which result from our global operating and financing activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.",

As of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes by approximately $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in i nterest rates would not impact the interest expense on our fixed rate senior notes outstanding. To hedge variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into treasury rate lock contracts.\n\nAs of November 3, 2024, we had $13.6 billion of outstanding 2023 Term Loans, which are subject to floating interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease the interest expense on the 2023 Term Loans for the next 12 months by approximately $137 million.

The increase was primarily due to the impact of a non-recurring intra-group transfer of certain IP rights to the United States as a result of supply chain realignment and the resulting shift in the jurisdictional mix of income.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of November 3, 2024 consisted of: (i) $9,348 million in cash and cash equivalents, (ii) cash we expect to generate from operations and (iii) available capacity under our $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. In addition, we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financings from time to time.\n\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our Board of Directors), (v) interest and principal payments related to our $69,847 million of outstanding indebtedness, and (vi) payment of income taxes. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in the fiscal year ending November 2, 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024. Our debt and liquidity needs increased in fiscal year 2024 as a result of completing the VMware Merger. We funded the cash portion of the consideration with net proceeds from the issuance of $30,390 million in term loans (the '2023 Term Loans'), as well as cash on hand. We also assumed $8,250 million of VMware's outstanding senior unsecured notes. During fiscal year 2024, we made repayments of $16,795 million on our 2023 Term Loans.\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months. For additional information regarding our cash requirement from contractual obligations, indebtedness and lease obligations, see Note 14. 'Commitments and Contingencies', Note 10. 'Borrowings' and Note 6. 'Leases' in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product l i nes . Any such transaction, or evaluation of potential transactions, could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances, we may seek to obtain new debt or equity fi nancing. However, we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service our senior unsecured notes, the 2023 Term Loans and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above.\n\nIn addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such tenders, exchanges or purchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We may also make additional prepayments of the 2023 Term Loans. The amounts involved may be material.",

('Broadcom'), a Delaware corporation, is a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, including artificial intelligence ('AI') networking and connectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology ('IT') environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Broadcom,' 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries. We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and i nfrastructure software. See Note 13. 'Segment Information' for additional information.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'). The VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53,398 million. VMware was a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all applications, enabling digital innovation with enterprise control. We acquired VMware to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of VMware commencing on November 22, 2023. See Note 4. 'Acquisitions' for additional information.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31. Our fiscal year ended November 3, 2024 ('fiscal year 2024') was a 53-week fiscal year, with the first fiscal quarter containing 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ended October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023') and fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ('fiscal year 2022') were both 52-week fiscal years.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, we completed a ten-for-one forward stock split of our common stock through the filing of an amendment ('Amendment') to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Amendment proportionately increased the number of shares of our authorized common stock without changing the par value of $0.001 per share. All share, equity award and per share amounts and related stockholders' equity balances presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the stock split.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.\n\n## BROADCOM INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

We differentiate ourselves through our high-performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing semiconductor products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins.\n\nOur infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology ('IT') environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Many of the largest companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500, and many government agencies rely on our software solutions to help manage and secure their on-premises and hybrid cloud environments, private cloud infrastructure and AI data centers. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security, making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems i ncorporating multiple semiconductor products.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'), in which VMware stockholders received, in aggregate, approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53.4 billion. We funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger consideration with net proceeds from the issuance of $30.4 billion in term loans under a credit agreement that we entered into on August 15, 2023, as well as cash on hand. Following the VMware Merger, we sold VMware's end-user computing business to KKR &amp; Co. Inc. for cash consideration of $3.5 billion, after working capital adjustments. With the VMware Merger, we have bolstered our infrastructure software solutions and are able to offer our customers a greater capacity to address complex IT infrastructure issues.\n\n## Business Strategy\n\nOur strategy is focused on technology leadership and category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions delivering a comprehensive suite of innovative infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies, as well as extensive internal research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology market l eadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.\n\n## Products and Markets\n\n## Semiconductor Solutions\n\nSemiconductors are made by imprinting a network of electronic components onto a semiconductor wafer. These devices are designed to perform various functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively filtering electronic signals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and storing data. Our digital and mixed signal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors offering fast switching speeds and low power consumption, which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also offer analog products, which are based on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency ('RF'), and optoelectronic applications. III-V refers to elements from the 3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are gallium arsenide ('GaAs') and indium phosphide ('InP').",

Business\n\n## Our Company\n\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems.  NVIDIA  is now a full-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\n\nOur full-stack includes the foundational CUDA  programming model that runs on all NVIDIA  GPUs, as well as hundreds of domain-specific software libraries, software development kits, or SDKs, and A pplication Programming Interfaces, or APIs. This deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance and eases the deployment of NVIDIA  accelerated computing for computationally intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, or A I, model training and inference, data analytics, scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimizations to address industries ranging from healthcare and telecom to automotive and manufacturing.\n\nOur  data-center-scale  offerings  are  comprised  of  compute  and  networking  solutions  that  can  scale  to  tens  of  thousands  of  GPU-accelerated  servers interconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture and scale is needed for the development and deployment of modern A I applications.\n\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. T oday , it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep learning algorithms. This form of A I, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots, and selfdriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative A I, which can create new content such as text,  code,  images,  audio,  video,  molecule  structures,  and  recommendation  systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as products, services, media, or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user's preferences.\n\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy , bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve.

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's growing reliance on CSPs, as both distribution partners and infrastructure providers, align with the risks outlined in the business continuity section, the strategic positioning in the AI ecosystem, and the revenue concentration data?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA's reliance on CSPs is multifaceted: they are key distribution partners for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure, as noted in the strategic overview (page 7), where NVIDIA's AI platforms are available through major CSPs. CSPs also serve as critical infrastructure providers, and any service interruptions from them could impair NVIDIA's ability to deliver services (page 22). Additionally, CSPs are identified as a key customer group within NVIDIA's revenue concentration, indicating their importance to the business (page 41). Together, these perspectives show that while CSPs are central to NVIDIA's go-to-market and operational strategy, especially in AI and data center growth, they also represent a material risk in terms of business continuity and service delivery reliability.",

Leveraging our technology leadership in A I and building on our longstanding automotive relationships, we are delivering a complete end-to-end solution for the A V  market under the DRIV E Hyperion brand. We have demonstrated multiple applications of A I within the car: A I can driv e the car itself as a pilot in fully  autonomous mode or it can also be a co-pilot, assisting the human driver while creating a safer driving experience.\n\nWe are working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tier-one suppliers, sensor manufacturers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep neural networks using our Data Center computing solutions, and then running a full perception, fusion, planning, and control stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA  DRIVE Hyperion platform. DRIVE Hyperion consists of the high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX  computing hardware running an in-vehicle operating system (DRIVE OS), a reference sensor set that supports full self-driving capability as well as an open, modular DRIV E software platform for autonomous driving, mapping, and parking services, and intelligent in-vehicle experiences.\n\nIn addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution based on NV IDIA  Omniverse software to develop synthetic data for A I model training, as well as for testing and validating a self-driving platform. Our unique end-to-end, software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.\n\n## Business Strategies\n\nNVIDIA's key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:\n\nAdvancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. Our accelerated computing platform can solve complex problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace M oore's Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, interconnect, algorithm, and software layers. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets, which include Data Center, Gaming, Professional V isualization, and A utomotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs, CPUs, CUDA  and networking technologies as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in research and development: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with shared underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.\n\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing platform for A I, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes full-stack data center-scale compute and networking solutions across processing units, interconnects, systems, and software. Our compute solutions include all three major processing units in A I servers - GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. GPUs are uniquely suited to A I, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position.\n\nIn addition, we offer DGX  Cloud, a fully managed A I-training-as-a-service platform, along with NV IDIA  A I Enterprise-a comprehensive software suite designed to simplify the development and deployment of production-grade, end-to-end generative A I applications. NV IDIA  A I Enterprise includes: NV IDIA  NIM , which delivers a 2.5x increase in token throughput using industry-leading open and proprietary models; NV IDIA  NeM o, a complete solution for curating, fine-tuning, evaluating, and safeguarding  domain-adapted  models;  and AI  Blueprints,  pre-built,  runnable  templates  that  help  enterprises  build,  optimize,  and  deploy A I  agents  while preserving privacy. These tools enable organizations to securely develop and run A I applications on NV IDIA -accelerated infrastructure anywhere.\n\nOur AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our computing platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and CSP , as well as on our own AI supercomputers. There are over 5.9 million developers worldwide using CUDA  and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize A I through partnerships with hundreds of universities and thousands of startups through our Inception program. A dditionally , our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform.\n\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics infused with AI is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications and create new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving the gaming, design, and creative  industries  forward,  as  developers  leverage  our  libraries  and  algorithms  to  deliver  an  optimized  experience  on  our  GeForce  and  NV IDIA   RTX platforms. Our computer graphics platforms leverage AI end-to-end, from the developer tools and cloud services to the T ensor Cores included in all RTX -class GPUs.

For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters,  high  heat  events,  water  shortages,  power  shortages,  information  technology  system  failures  or  cyber-attacks,  military  actions  or  economic,  and business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war, or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely , or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. A ll of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Some of our employees in the region have been on active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\n\nAdditionally , interruptions or delay s in serv ices from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely , including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. A s we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy . Power or water shortages, land or permitting constraints, or regulations that limit energy , water, or land availability , could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services, which may in turn negatively impact our business.\n\n## Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\n\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability  in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively . Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. A lthough we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property , casualty , and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, and greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\n\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.\n\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.\n\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.",

      "answer": "Apple's declining Mac and iPad sales (from $29.36B and $28.30B in 2023 to $29.98B and $26.69B in 2024 respectively) reduce the installed base of devices that could serve as platforms for Apple Music consumption. This hardware constraint compounds the third-party content licensing risks described in the risk factors, where Apple acknowledges it may be unable to continue offering a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices due to potential content provider restrictions or increased costs. Additionally, the competitive landscape analysis reveals Apple faces significant pressure from competitors who imitate product features or offer services at little or no profit, making it harder for Apple Music to differentiate itself in a market where competitors may have broader product lines and larger installed device bases. These combined factors create specific constraints on Apple Music's ability to grow its contribution to the $85.2 billion services revenue base reported in 2023.",

      "question": "How does Apple's geographic segmentation strategy for the Rest of Asia Pacific reflect in its financial performance and year-over-year sales trends, particularly in relation to the growth of its Services business?",
      "answer": "Apple's segmentation strategy for the Rest of Asia Pacific, which includes countries like Australia and other Asian nations outside its other reportable segments, is structured to align with regional market dynamics. In 2024, the Rest of Asia Pacific reported $30,658 million in net sales and $13,062 million in operating income, showing moderate growth compared to 2023. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in Services sales, which aligns with Apple's broader strategy of emphasizing recurring revenue streams. However, the region faced a net unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations, which dampened the overall sales growth. This synthesis reveals that while the Rest of Asia Pacific contributes meaningfully to Apple's global revenue, its performance is sensitive to macroeconomic factors like currency exchange rates.",

        "Hop 1: [AAPL](page_5) \u2192 [Rest of Asia Pacific]: The Rest of Asia Pacific is defined as a reportable geographic segment, including Australia and other Asian countries not covered by other segments, and is managed separately to align with regional market dynamics.",

        "Hop 3: [AAPL](page_25) \u2192 [Rest of Asia Pacific]: The region's net sales increased in 2024 due primarily to higher Services sales, though foreign currency weakness against the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on reported results."

This obligation triggered a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion net in 2024 after the ECJ upheld the decision, which was partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits.

      "question": "How does Cisco's Secure, Agile Networks revenue growth in fiscal 2022 align with its product composition and revenue recognition practices, especially considering the mix of hardware, perpetual software, and SaaS offerings?",
      "answer": "Cisco's Secure, Agile Networks revenue grew by 5% ($1.1 billion) in fiscal 2022, driven by campus switching (Catalyst 9000), data center switching (Nexus 9000 and Meraki), and wireless (WiFi-6 and Meraki), despite a decline in enterprise routing. This growth is reflected in the $23.8 billion in reported revenue for the category. The product category includes hardware, perpetual software (recognized upfront), term licenses (split between upfront license and ratably recognized maintenance), and SaaS (recognized ratably over time), which together shape both the growth profile and the revenue recognition timing. The mix of upfront and ratably recognized revenue suggests that while some revenue is immediately recognized, SaaS and maintenance portions contribute more steadily over time, potentially stabilizing future revenue streams.",

      "question": "How does the change in fair value of available-for-sale debt investments between fiscal years 2021 and 2022, combined with the net gains (losses) on these investments and the sensitivity analysis under different interest rate scenarios, reflect Cisco\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk and its impact on financial performance?",
      "answer": "Cisco's available-for-sale debt investments decreased in fair value from $15,206 million in 2021 to $11,947 million in 2022, a drop of $3,259 million. Over the same period, net gains on these investments fell from $53 million to $9 million, indicating reduced performance. The sensitivity analysis shows that a 150 basis point increase in interest rates would further reduce the fair value to $11,630 million, highlighting significant exposure to rising rates. This combination of declining value, reduced gains, and sensitivity to rate changes underscores Cisco\u2019s financial vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations.",

      "answer": "Cisco positions AppDynamics on page 5 as a central element of its full stack observability strategy, alongside Intersight and ThousandEyes, to provide end-to-end visibility across modern application environments. On page 8, AppDynamics is explicitly highlighted as part of the company\u2019s monitoring and analytics offerings, reinforcing its strategic importance in delivering real-time insights. However, on page 45, Cisco reports that while the Optimized Application Experiences category grew by 11% (or $75 million), this growth was partially offset by a decline specifically in AppDynamics offerings, even as ThousandEyes and Intersight saw increases. This divergence suggests that despite AppDynamics' strategic positioning, it underperformed relative to other components in the same category, raising questions about execution, market demand, or integration challenges post-acquisition.",

In a multicloud environment, customers have to reimagine how they design, develop and deploy their applications. They need to be able to build applications quickly, deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time.\n\nWe  believe  we  are  uniquely  positioned  to  enable  successful  business  outcomes  for  customers  in  hybrid  and  multicloud environments. In our view, networks are increasingly critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms.\n\nWe  are  continuing  our  commitment  to  deliver  full  stack  observability  from  the  application  to  the  infrastructure  to  give  our customers  greater  insights  that  enable  faster,  better  decision  making.  We  are  doing  this  through  adding  key  elements  to  our portfolio, such as: infrastructure optimization with Intersight, network monitoring with technology from ThousandEyes, application performance monitoring with AppDynamics, as well as our security innovations.\n\n## Power Hybrid Work\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the world has shifted to a hybrid work environment, and we believe that our customers are looking  to  support  a  blend  of  onsite  and  offsite  workers.  To  enable  a  hybrid  workforce,  customers  require  secure  access, collaboration, and technologies to empower their teams to connect seamlessly and to work from anywhere.\n\nCustomers are looking to us to help improve how their people communicate, collaborate and to increase productivity. At Cisco, we are focused on providing and delivering highly secure collaboration experiences to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment.\n\nWe  believe  our  collaboration  portfolio,  which  includes  our  subscription-based  Webex  conferencing  platform,  with  meetings, devices,  calling  and  messaging,  is  at  the  center  of  our  customers'  strategy  for  enabling  their  teams  to  be  more  productive  and secure. To help our customers transform their workplaces, we continue to invest to expand our capabilities by introducing new Webex Calling innovations in the Webex Suite to improve work flexibility, reliability, and quality. Additionally, we also launched new devices for hybrid work - the Webex Room Bar and a Cisco Video Phone.\n\n## Transform Infrastructure\n\nIn an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure in an automated way in order to manage and monitor each connection in real time. Our strategy to help our customers transform their infrastructure with the network at the core began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading enterprise architectures, and continued with the launch of our Catalyst 9000 series of switches.\n\nWe  have  continued  to  transform  our  enterprise  access  portfolio  by  bringing  together  several  technologies  to  form  the  only integrated architecture with built-in simplicity, automation and security at the foundation. This architecture is designed to enable our customers to securely connect their users and devices to applications and data over any network, no matter where they are.\n\nWe  have  introduced  several  innovations  that  extend  our  networking  capabilities  to  wireless  and  enterprise  routing  products, including Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications  and  workloads  in  an  optimized  and  highly  secure  manner.  We  have  continued  to  expand  our  SD-WAN  offering, through  our  Cloud  OnRamp  integrations  with  several  webscale  providers  to  deliver  predictable  and  highly  secure  application experiences.\n\nTo further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, to operate  and  enhance  network  capabilities.  These  network  product  offerings  are  designed  to  help  enable  customers  to  detect cybersecurity threats, even in encrypted traffic. As such, we have created, in our view, the only network that is designed for security while also helping to maintain privacy.\n\nOur customers are operating in multicloud environments with private, public and hybrid clouds. For the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside, by extending our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings. We continue to invest in our data center portfolio  to  help  meet  the  growing  demand  for  cloud-delivered  technologies.  Our  recently  launched  Nexus  Cloud  platform  is designed to help our customers deploy, manage, and operate their data center networks from the cloud.",

In a multicloud environment, customers have to reimagine how they design, develop and deploy their applications. They need to be able to build applications quickly, deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time.\n\nWe  believe  we  are  uniquely  positioned  to  enable  successful  business  outcomes  for  customers  in  hybrid  and  multicloud environments. In our view, networks are increasingly critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms.\n\nWe  are  continuing  our  commitment  to  deliver  full  stack  observability  from  the  application  to  the  infrastructure  to  give  our customers  greater  insights  that  enable  faster,  better  decision  making.  We  are  doing  this  through  adding  key  elements  to  our portfolio, such as: infrastructure optimization with Intersight, network monitoring with technology from ThousandEyes, application performance monitoring with AppDynamics, as well as our security innovations.\n\n## Power Hybrid Work\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the world has shifted to a hybrid work environment, and we believe that our customers are looking  to  support  a  blend  of  onsite  and  offsite  workers.  To  enable  a  hybrid  workforce,  customers  require  secure  access, collaboration, and technologies to empower their teams to connect seamlessly and to work from anywhere.\n\nCustomers are looking to us to help improve how their people communicate, collaborate and to increase productivity. At Cisco, we are focused on providing and delivering highly secure collaboration experiences to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment.\n\nWe  believe  our  collaboration  portfolio,  which  includes  our  subscription-based  Webex  conferencing  platform,  with  meetings, devices,  calling  and  messaging,  is  at  the  center  of  our  customers'  strategy  for  enabling  their  teams  to  be  more  productive  and secure. To help our customers transform their workplaces, we continue to invest to expand our capabilities by introducing new Webex Calling innovations in the Webex Suite to improve work flexibility, reliability, and quality. Additionally, we also launched new devices for hybrid work - the Webex Room Bar and a Cisco Video Phone.\n\n## Transform Infrastructure\n\nIn an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure in an automated way in order to manage and monitor each connection in real time. Our strategy to help our customers transform their infrastructure with the network at the core began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading enterprise architectures, and continued with the launch of our Catalyst 9000 series of switches.\n\nWe  have  continued  to  transform  our  enterprise  access  portfolio  by  bringing  together  several  technologies  to  form  the  only integrated architecture with built-in simplicity, automation and security at the foundation. This architecture is designed to enable our customers to securely connect their users and devices to applications and data over any network, no matter where they are.\n\nWe  have  introduced  several  innovations  that  extend  our  networking  capabilities  to  wireless  and  enterprise  routing  products, including Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications  and  workloads  in  an  optimized  and  highly  secure  manner.  We  have  continued  to  expand  our  SD-WAN  offering, through  our  Cloud  OnRamp  integrations  with  several  webscale  providers  to  deliver  predictable  and  highly  secure  application experiences.\n\nTo further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, to operate  and  enhance  network  capabilities.  These  network  product  offerings  are  designed  to  help  enable  customers  to  detect cybersecurity threats, even in encrypted traffic. As such, we have created, in our view, the only network that is designed for security while also helping to maintain privacy.\n\nOur customers are operating in multicloud environments with private, public and hybrid clouds. For the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside, by extending our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings. We continue to invest in our data center portfolio  to  help  meet  the  growing  demand  for  cloud-delivered  technologies.  Our  recently  launched  Nexus  Cloud  platform  is designed to help our customers deploy, manage, and operate their data center networks from the cloud.",

This accounting treatment aligns with Oracle's broader service offerings strategy, where hardware support is framed as an integrated component of the company's value proposition for ongoing customer engagement and IT environment management (page_72).

      "question": "How does Oracle position the Autonomous Database as a strategic differentiator in cloud infrastructure, particularly given its technical automation features and its contribution to 54% of cloud and license revenues?",
      "answer": "Oracle positions the Autonomous Database as a strategic differentiator by emphasizing its self-driving capabilities that automate database administration tasks like maintenance, tuning, and security, reducing labor costs and human error (page 12). This automation is powered by machine learning and integrated with OCI to deliver scalable, secure, and high-performing infrastructure for enterprise workloads. The product aligns with Oracle\u2019s broader strategy to drive cloud migration and expand its cloud and license business, particularly as customers increasingly adopt cloud-based models (page 7). Financial significance is underscored by the fact that infrastructure technologies, including Autonomous Database, represented 54% of Oracle\u2019s total cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2024, demonstrating its central role in Oracle\u2019s revenue engine (page 10).",

      "answer": "Oracle reported that its cloud services revenues represented 37%, 32%, and 25% of total revenues during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, indicating a consistent upward trend in cloud adoption (page_8). This growth is supported by increased infrastructure investments, including those made to support the increase in cloud services and license support revenues, which were a direct factor in the higher cloud services and license support expenses noted in fiscal 2024 (page_48). Additionally, Oracle introduced specific customer migration programs to pivot applications and infrastructure licenses to the Oracle Cloud, which aligns with the company\u2019s strategy to drive cloud adoption and explains the upward trajectory in cloud services revenues (page_8). Together, these factors illustrate a strategic alignment between infrastructure investment, customer migration initiatives, and the resulting revenue growth from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).",

      "question": "How does Oracle's strategic positioning of Oracle Cloud Services in its financial disclosures align with its risk discussion around cloud execution and its hardware integration capabilities, particularly in terms of deployment models, infrastructure dependencies, and revenue recognition volatility?",
      "answer": "Oracle positions Oracle Cloud Services as a core strategic offering, providing customers with flexible deployment models including SaaS and OCI, which are integral to Oracle\u2019s cloud-first strategy. However, the risk section highlights that Oracle faces execution risks and revenue volatility due to the subscription-based nature of cloud offerings, which recognizes revenue ratably, in contrast to the upfront recognition of on-premise licenses. Additionally, Oracle relies on hardware infrastructure, including servers and storage systems, to support Oracle Cloud Services, and integrates these with cloud offerings for hybrid environments. The combination of execution risk, revenue timing differences, and hardware dependencies creates a complex operational and financial landscape for Oracle Cloud Services.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [ORCL](page_72) \u2192 [Oracle Cloud Services]: Financial disclosures describe Oracle Cloud Services (SaaS and OCI) as a comprehensive cloud offering with flexible deployment models, indicating strategic importance and integration with Oracle\u2019s broader product ecosystem.",
        "Hop 2: [ORCL](page_22) \u2192 [Oracle Cloud Services]: Risk section highlights execution risks, noting that Oracle\u2019s cloud strategy may not generate sufficient revenue or maintain profitability, and emphasizes revenue recognition volatility due to the subscription model versus upfront license sales.",
        "Hop 3: [ORCL](page_14) \u2192 [Oracle Cloud Services]: Hardware and infrastructure section shows that Oracle Cloud Services depend on Oracle servers, storage, and engineered systems, which are key components of cloud deployment and hybrid integration, indicating infrastructure dependencies that support cloud offerings."

      "answer": "Oracle's Management Software is a core component of its hardware business, which accounted for 6% of total revenues in fiscal 2023. This business includes Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, and related software such as management tools, which are tightly integrated and sold as combined performance obligations. The hardware business, including management software, is positioned to support diverse IT environments, including cloud-based, on-premise, and hybrid deployments. Oracle emphasizes that its infrastructure technologies, including management software, are designed to improve deployment, integration, and performance in hybrid environments, such as through the Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer model. This aligns with Oracle\u2019s broader competitive differentiation claims, where it states that its integrated systems deliver improved performance, availability, scalability, and security\u2014particularly for Oracle Database workloads\u2014compared to competitors\u2019 offerings.",

      "answer": "The 2001 Share Incentive Plan no longer has shares available for future issuance (page_49), yet Accenture continues to recognize compensation expense for outstanding restricted share units with vesting terms ranging from two to five years, either on a straight-line or graded basis (page_91). This indicates that while the 2001 plan is no longer active for new grants, its legacy awards remain in effect and are still impacting financial statements. Meanwhile, the Amended and Restated 2010 Share Incentive Plan is now the primary plan in use, as evidenced by the 14,830,623 shares issuable and 27,381,461 shares remaining available for future issuance (page_49), and its formal documentation is referenced as Exhibit 10.6 in the filing (page_51).

In fiscal 2022, these markets contributed $12.2 billion in revenue, representing 21% growth in U.S. dollars and 29% growth in local currency.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in 'Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use the terms 'Accenture,' 'we,' the 'Company,' 'our' and 'us' in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to 'fiscal 2022' means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2022. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\n\nWe use the term 'in local currency' so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results 'in local currency' are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Overview\n\nAccenture plc is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy &amp; Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world's leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services-creating tangible value at speed and scale.\n\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business, particularly with regard to wage inflation and increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. During fiscal 2022, we disposed of our business in Russia and recorded a non-operating loss of $96 million. We do not have a business in Ukraine or Belarus.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nWe saw very strong demand across our business in fiscal 2022 as our clients continue their digital transformations. Key metrics for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 included:\n\n- Revenues of $61.6 billion, representing 22% growth in U.S. dollars and 26% growth in local currency;\n- New bookings of $71.7 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currency;\n- Operating margin of 15.2%, a 10 basis point expansion;\n- Diluted earnings per share of $10.71, an increase of 16.9% over $9.16 for fiscal 2021, including a $0.15 per share or 2% negative impact from the disposition of our business in Russia; and\n- Cash returned to shareholders of $6.6 billion, including share purchases of $4.1 billion and dividends of $2.5 billion.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's historical seasonality in integrated circuit sales interact with its strategic expansion into automotive and IoT markets, given its financial statement emphasis on deriving revenue from both integrated circuit products and licensing?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's integrated circuit (IC) sales have historically been subject to seasonality driven by consumer demand for wireless devices and the timing of product launches, as noted in the MD&A section (page 40). However, the business overview (page 6) highlights Qualcomm's strategic expansion into automotive and IoT markets, where seasonality may be less pronounced, through products like the Snapdragon\u00ae Digital Chassis\u2122 platforms. This diversification could help stabilize revenue streams. The financial statements (page 65) clarify that Qualcomm derives revenue primarily from both IC product sales and licensing, which suggests that while IC sales remain vulnerable to seasonal demand, the licensing model may provide more consistent income. Therefore, the broader diversification into automotive and IoT, combined with the dual revenue streams, represents a strategic effort to mitigate the impact of historical seasonality in its core mobile IC business.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and 2023. Discussions of fiscal 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2023.\n\n## Our Business and Operating Segments\n\nWe develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products.

Many of our products and much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such as the transition to the next generation of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance of and during device launches incorporating our products and in QTL revenues when licensees' sales occur. These trends may or may not continue in the future. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings.",

Business\n\nWe incorporated in California in 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1991. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Our 52-week fiscal years consist of four equal fiscal quarters of 13 weeks each, and our 53-week fiscal years consist of three 13-week fiscal quarters and one 14-week fiscal quarter. The financial results for our 53-week fiscal years and our 14-week fiscal quarters will not be ex actly comparable to our 52-week fiscal years and our 13-week fiscal quarters. Our fiscal years for 2024, 2023 and 2022 included 53 weeks, 52 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and commercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our technologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our innovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, driving digital transformation with our ecosystem partners in areas including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). In automotive, our Snapdragon\u00ae Digital Chassis\u2122 platforms, including connectivity, digital cockpit and advanced driver assistance and automated driving (ADAS/AD), are helping to connect the car to its environment and the cloud, creating unique in-cabin experiences and enabling a comprehensive assisted and automated driving solution. In IoT, our inventions have helped power growth in industries and applications such as consumer (including personal computers (PCs), tablets, voice and music and extended reality (XR)), edge networking (including mobile broadband and wireless access points) and industrial (including handhelds, retail, tracking and logistics and utilities). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, including our Snapdragon\u00ae family of highly-integrated, system-based solutions, and licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nThe foundational technologies we invent help power modern digital experiences. We share these inventions broadly through our licensing programs enabling wide ecosystem access to technologies at the core of mobile innovation, and through the sale of our integrated circuit platforms (also known as integrated circuit products, chips, chipsets or modules) and other products. We innovate and collaborate across many ecosystems, including with manufacturers, operators, developers, system integrators, cloud providers, test tool vendors, service providers, governments and industry standards organizations, to enable next-generation digital transformation. For nearly 40 years, we have been a leader in setting industry standards and creating era-defining technology breakthroughs, and we continue to play a leading role in developing system-level inventions that serve as the foundation for multiple generations of advanced wireless technologies. This includes technologies such as CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) families of technologies, with the latter encompassing LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and 5G NR (New Radio), which are the primary digital technologies currently used to transmit voice or data over radio waves using a public or private cellular wireless network.",

Significant Accounting Policies\n\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and commercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our technologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our innovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and through the licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results of Qualcomm, its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (Note 2). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nFinancial Statement Preparation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Examples of our significant accounting estimates and policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others include: the estimation of sales-based royalty revenues; the impairment of non-marketable equity investments; the valuation of inventories; the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the recognition, measurement and disclosure of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings; and the calculation of our income tax provision, including the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nFiscal Year. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\n\nCash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and notes and certain bank time deposits, U.S. Treasury securities and governmentrelated securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\n\nMarketable Securities. Marketable securities include marketable equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities and, from time-to-time, certain time deposits. We classify marketable securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nIf a debt security has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security. For the remaining debt securities, if an unrealized loss ex ists, we separate the impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factors and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factors. Unrealized gains or unrealized losses that are not related to credit factors on available-forsale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities and subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment and other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and economy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\n\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with equity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in net earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are generally recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. We monitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee's financial condition and business forecasts and lower",

Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities and subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment and other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and economy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\n\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with equity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in net earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are generally recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. We monitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee's financial condition and business forecasts and lower",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's strategic emphasis on low-power computing is a central component of its broader plan to expand beyond mobile handsets into new markets such as automotive and IoT. The company explicitly states in its business overview (page 6) that it is scaling innovations across industries using foundational technologies like low-power computing, with specific applications in Snapdragon Digital Chassis platforms for automotive and IoT solutions spanning consumer, edge networking, and industrial sectors. This strategic direction is supported by significant R&D investments, as noted in the financial statements (page 65), where Qualcomm reports continued development of technologies including high-performance and low-power computing, which underpin its product roadmap across multiple industries. Furthermore, the company's risk factors (page 20) highlight that growth depends on extending technologies into new areas and that investments in low-power computing may not yield expected returns if market adoption lags or competitive pressures intensify. Together, these sections show that Qualcomm is financially and strategically committed to low-power computing as a core enabler of its expansion, but also acknowledges the associated risks in execution and market acceptance.",

See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nPolitical actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs, bans or placing companies on restricted entity lists, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese customers; our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices that incorporate our integrated circuit products into China; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to our Chinese customers or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, or we or our customers were limited in or prohibited from selling in the United States products containing technologies with Chinese-origin content, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factors titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected ' and ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nFor example, we previously sold 4G and other integrated circuit products, including Wi-Fi products, but excluding 5G products, to Huawei under export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. On May 7, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce informed us that it was revoking our license to export 4G and certain other integrated circuit products to Huawei, effective immediately, and we implemented procedures to immediately comply. Accordingly, we do not expect to receive any further product revenues from Huawei. Product revenues from Huawei in fiscal 2024, prior to our license being revoked on May 7, 2024, were approximately $560 million. Additionally, to the ex tent that Huawei's devices take share from Chinese OEMs that utilize our products or from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our products in devices they sell into China, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be further impacted.\n\nFinally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n\nWhile we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements of foundational technologies, including wireless connectivity, high-performance and lowpower computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI), we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our ex isting technical and business ex pertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n\nIn particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing related products and technologies. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G and next-generation wireless technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using these technologies.\n\nHowever, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new technologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and commercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our technologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our innovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and through the licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results of Qualcomm, its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (Note 2). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nFinancial Statement Preparation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Examples of our significant accounting estimates and policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others include: the estimation of sales-based royalty revenues; the impairment of non-marketable equity investments; the valuation of inventories; the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the recognition, measurement and disclosure of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings; and the calculation of our income tax provision, including the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nFiscal Year. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\n\nCash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and notes and certain bank time deposits, U.S. Treasury securities and governmentrelated securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\n\nMarketable Securities. Marketable securities include marketable equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities and, from time-to-time, certain time deposits. We classify marketable securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nIf a debt security has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security. For the remaining debt securities, if an unrealized loss ex ists, we separate the impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factors and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factors. Unrealized gains or unrealized losses that are not related to credit factors on available-forsale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities and subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment and other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and economy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\n\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with equity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in net earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are generally recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net.

Business\n\nWe incorporated in California in 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1991. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Our 52-week fiscal years consist of four equal fiscal quarters of 13 weeks each, and our 53-week fiscal years consist of three 13-week fiscal quarters and one 14-week fiscal quarter. The financial results for our 53-week fiscal years and our 14-week fiscal quarters will not be ex actly comparable to our 52-week fiscal years and our 13-week fiscal quarters. Our fiscal years for 2024, 2023 and 2022 included 53 weeks, 52 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and commercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our technologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our innovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, driving digital transformation with our ecosystem partners in areas including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). In automotive, our Snapdragon\u00ae Digital Chassis\u2122 platforms, including connectivity, digital cockpit and advanced driver assistance and automated driving (ADAS/AD), are helping to connect the car to its environment and the cloud, creating unique in-cabin experiences and enabling a comprehensive assisted and automated driving solution. In IoT, our inventions have helped power growth in industries and applications such as consumer (including personal computers (PCs), tablets, voice and music and extended reality (XR)), edge networking (including mobile broadband and wireless access points) and industrial (including handhelds, retail, tracking and logistics and utilities). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, including our Snapdragon\u00ae family of highly-integrated, system-based solutions, and licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nThe foundational technologies we invent help power modern digital experiences. We share these inventions broadly through our licensing programs enabling wide ecosystem access to technologies at the core of mobile innovation, and through the sale of our integrated circuit platforms (also known as integrated circuit products, chips, chipsets or modules) and other products. We innovate and collaborate across many ecosystems, including with manufacturers, operators, developers, system integrators, cloud providers, test tool vendors, service providers, governments and industry standards organizations, to enable next-generation digital transformation. For nearly 40 years, we have been a leader in setting industry standards and creating era-defining technology breakthroughs, and we continue to play a leading role in developing system-level inventions that serve as the foundation for multiple generations of advanced wireless technologies. This includes technologies such as CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) families of technologies, with the latter encompassing LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and 5G NR (New Radio), which are the primary digital technologies currently used to transmit voice or data over radio waves using a public or private cellular wireless network.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's exposure to U.S./China national security policies, particularly the revocation of its license to sell 4G and certain other integrated circuit products to Huawei, has had a measurable financial impact, with approximately $560 million in product revenues lost from Huawei in fiscal 2024. This directly affects Qualcomm's financial performance and could further impact revenues if Huawei gains market share at the expense of Chinese or non-Chinese OEMs that utilize Qualcomm's products. Additionally, these policies may negatively influence Qualcomm's competitive positioning in 5G and adjacent markets, such as automotive and IoT, as the company relies on maintaining leadership in 5G technology development and product supply to sustain and grow its business long-term. Furthermore, trade and national security policies could disrupt supply chains by increasing costs or limiting access to critical components, which could hinder Qualcomm's ability to deliver competitive products in a timely and cost-effective manner.",

See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nPolitical actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs, bans or placing companies on restricted entity lists, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese customers; our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices that incorporate our integrated circuit products into China; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to our Chinese customers or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, or we or our customers were limited in or prohibited from selling in the United States products containing technologies with Chinese-origin content, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factors titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected ' and ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nFor example, we previously sold 4G and other integrated circuit products, including Wi-Fi products, but excluding 5G products, to Huawei under export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. On May 7, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce informed us that it was revoking our license to export 4G and certain other integrated circuit products to Huawei, effective immediately, and we implemented procedures to immediately comply. Accordingly, we do not expect to receive any further product revenues from Huawei. Product revenues from Huawei in fiscal 2024, prior to our license being revoked on May 7, 2024, were approximately $560 million. Additionally, to the ex tent that Huawei's devices take share from Chinese OEMs that utilize our products or from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our products in devices they sell into China, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be further impacted.\n\nFinally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n\nWhile we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements of foundational technologies, including wireless connectivity, high-performance and lowpower computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI), we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our ex isting technical and business ex pertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n\nIn particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing related products and technologies. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G and next-generation wireless technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using these technologies.\n\nHowever, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new technologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be",

We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products in order to sustain and grow our business long-term.\n\nAs we look forward to the next several quarters:\n\n- We expect transitions to new generations of leading process technology nodes to continue to drive product cost increases from certain of our key semiconductor wafer suppliers.\n- We expect continued intense competition, including from vertical integration by certain of our customers (e.g., Apple).\n- Current U.S./China trade relations and/or national security protection policies may negatively impact our business, growth prospects and results of operations. See 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.'\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we ex tended, renewed or entered into license agreements with several key OEMs. We are currently pursuing negotiations with other key OEMs whose agreements expire in early fiscal 2025 (including Huawei). In addition, in fiscal 2024, we entered into a license agreement with Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Limited (a growing, China-headquartered OEM that sells primarily in developing regions) for its 5G products. While we continue to engage in negotiations toward a comprehensive resolution, we have initiated litigation against Transsion in multiple jurisdictions to enforce our intellectual property rights against certain of its unlicensed products. See 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factors titled ' The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring ' and 'The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions. '\n\nWe are also involved in other legal proceedings, including those described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Litigation is inherently uncertain, and, while we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in such matters, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless industry and governments as to the benefits of our licensing programs and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technologies and not welcome the success of our licensing programs in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. Accordingly, such companies, and/or governments or regulators, may continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.\n\nFurther discussion of risks related to our business is provided in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' included in this Annual Report.",

          "chunk_text": "supplying our products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Additionally, supply and costs of raw materials, equipment and other products may be negatively impacted by trade and/or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain countries or companies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, or trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.\n\nOur manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and as a result, we may not be able to deliver our products or do so in a timely, costeffective or competitive manner. Further, to remain competitive and meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nFrom time to time, we purchase equipment to meet expected customer demand in advance of any purchase orders or long-term purchase commitments. Further, we typically begin manufacturing our products using our or our customers' forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates and may not be covered by long-term purchase commitments. As a result, we may incur increased inventory and manufacturing costs and/or record impairment charges to the extent anticipated sales ultimately do not materialize or are lower than ex pected. If we or our customers overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers' control, and such demand is not covered by a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and/or increased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charges, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION\n\n## Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.\n\nThe successful operation of various functions within our business, as well as the protection of our intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information, depend in part on the security and functionality of our IT systems. Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems, and many such attacks are increasingly more sophisticated. These attacks, which might be related to industrial, corporate or other espionage, criminal hackers or statesponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other IT infrastructure and impersonating authorized users, among others. We are also subject to ransom-style cyber-attacks, which could expose our confidential or proprietary information, demand payment of money and/or impact our IT systems and cause widespread disruption to our business, including our manufacturing operations. Third parties that store and/or process our confidential information, or that provide products, software or services used in our IT infrastructure, are subject to similar attacks, which could also result in malware being introduced into our IT infrastructure, e.g., through the third parties' software and/or software updates. Such attacks could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our IT systems. Any damage to or disruptions in our IT systems as a result of cyber-attacks or for other reasons, such as issues related to third-party software or services used in our IT infrastructure, could significantly disrupt our business operations.\n\nAlthough we maintain a cybersecurity program to manage cybersecurity risks, as more fully described in the 'Cybersecurity' section of this Annual Report, we cannot anticipate, detect, repel or implement fully effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use AI to develop malicious code and increasingly sophisticated phishing attempts. As part of our cybersecurity program, we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our IT systems and software (including third party software used in our IT systems) that could be exploited by hackers or other malicious actors. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are ex ploited. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or other attacks have in the past, in certain instances and to certain degrees, been successful (but have not caused significant harm), and may in the future be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.\n\nIn addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, wrongfully use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk is ex acerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire our employees. See also the Risk Factor titled 'We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees.' Similarly, we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and",

      "answer": "Accenture's Class X Ordinary Shares play a unique role in the company's capital structure and governance framework. Unlike the publicly traded Class A Ordinary Shares, Class X Ordinary Shares have no established trading market, indicating limited liquidity and a more restricted ownership base \u2014 as of September 30, 2024, there were only 14 holders of record and 307,754 shares outstanding. These shares carry voting rights but do not entitle holders to dividends or any claims on assets during liquidation, distinguishing them from both Class A and preferred shares. This structure suggests that Class X shares are primarily held by long-term stakeholders, such as former partners, and are closely tied to Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, with redemptions of Class X shares automatically aligned with the redemption or exchange of those exchangeable shares. This interlocking mechanism ensures that the number of Class X shares never exceeds the number of exchangeable shares, reinforcing a controlled governance model that supports continuity in decision-making while maintaining a clear separation between economic and voting interests.",

      "answer": "The stagnation in operating income and slight revenue decline in Growth Markets indicates a plateau in Accenture's performance in these regions, despite consistent operating margins at 16% in fiscal 2024 and 2023. This suggests that while Accenture maintains profitability in these markets, it faces challenges in driving revenue growth, potentially due to macroeconomic conditions or market saturation. The geographic segmentation logic, which attributes performance to client locations, shows that Growth Markets accounted for 17% of total revenues in fiscal 2024, down from 18% in fiscal 2023, reinforcing the lack of expansion. However, the 7% local currency growth indicates that internal performance may be stronger than dollar figures suggest, pointing to currency exchange rates as a key drag on reported results. Together, these perspectives suggest that Accenture's strategy in Growth Markets may need recalibration to convert local momentum into broader financial gains.",

      "answer": "Adobe faces exposure from tax examinations that focus on its intercompany transfer pricing practices, which could lead to adjustments affecting its effective tax rate and financial position. The company has accrued approximately $22 million in fiscal 2021 for accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions, indicating a material risk in its tax reserves. Additionally, Adobe's income tax accounting involves significant assumptions and estimates, particularly regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are subject to change based on audit outcomes. These uncertainties, combined with the expectation of volatility in tax asset and liability classifications during audit settlements, could result in significant fluctuations in financial statements and an unfavorably impacted future effective tax rate.",

Among other considerations, the applicability and impact of these tax provisions, and of other U.S. or international tax law changes could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in future years.\n\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items including, but not limited to, the effects of tax credits, net tax benefits from trading structure changes, tax benefits from  stock-based  compensation  and  settlements  of  tax  examinations,  and  to  net  tax  on  earnings  from  foreign  operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, the geographic mix of earnings, our repatriation policy or the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\n\nIn addition, in the United States and other countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including  changes  to  tax  laws  applicable  to  corporate  multinationals  such  as Adobe. These  countries,  governmental  bodies  and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nMoreover,  we  are  subject  to  the  examination  of  our  income  tax  returns  by  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  and  other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our research and development tax credits, intercompany  transfer  pricing  practices  and  other  matters.  We  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  of  outcomes  resulting  from  these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.\n\nWe  provide  products  and  services,  directly  and  indirectly,  to  a  variety  of  government  entities,  both  domestically  and internationally.  Risks  associated  with  licensing  and  selling  products  and  services  to  government  entities  include  more  extended sales  and  collection  cycles,  varying  governmental  budgeting  processes  and  adherence  to  complex  procurement  regulations  and other government-specific contractual requirements. We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations  relating  to  our  government  contracts  and  any  violations  could  result  in  various  civil  and  criminal  penalties  and administrative  sanctions,  including  termination  of  contracts,  payment  of  fines,  and  suspension  or  debarment  from  future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Financial Performance\n\n## Subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.\n\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which typically  range  from  1  to  36  months. As  a  result,  most  of  the  subscription  revenue  we  report  in  each  quarter  is  the  result  of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter. Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected  in  our  results  of  operations  until  future  periods.  Our  subscription  model  could  also  make  it  difficult  for  us  to  rapidly increase  our  revenue  from  subscription-based  or  hosted  services  through  additional  sales  in  any  period,  as  revenue  from  new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\n\nAdditionally,  in  connection  with  our  sales  efforts  to  enterprise  customers,  a  number  of  factors  could  affect  our  revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.",

These  amounts  were  included  in  long-term  income  taxes payable in their respective years.\n\nWhile we file federal, state and local income tax returns globally, our major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and  foreign  tax  authorities.  These  tax  examinations  are  expected  to  focus  on  our  research  and  development  tax  credits, intercompany transfer pricing practices and other matters. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest fiscal years open for examination are 2008, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\n\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we  can  only  determine  a  range  of  estimated  potential  decreases  in  underlying  unrecognized  tax  benefits  ranging  from  $0  to approximately $5 million over the next 12 months.",

The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin.\n\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n\n## Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  temporary  differences  between  the  financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service  and  other  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities.  These  tax  examinations  are  expected  to  focus  on  our  research  and development tax credits, intercompany transfer pricing practices and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have a significant impact on the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\nIn  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  a  privately  held  company  that  provides  a cloud-based  video  collaboration  platform,  for  approximately  $1.18  billion  and  we  began  integrating  Frame.io  into  our  Digital Media reportable segment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52 billion in cash consideration and we began integrating Workfront into our Digital Experience reportable segment.\n\nSee Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.",

      "question": "How does Adobe's use of collateral security agreements in managing foreign exchange derivative risk compare across its quantitative exposure disclosures, derivative accounting policies, and risk mitigation strategies, particularly in terms of cash flow impact and counterparty credit exposure?",
      "answer": "Adobe uses collateral security agreements to manage counterparty credit risk associated with foreign exchange derivatives, which is evident in the $3.03 billion notional exposure disclosed as of December 3, 2021 (page 54). These agreements are formally described in the derivative accounting policies (page 79), where Adobe exchanges cash collateral with counterparties when the net fair value of contracts fluctuates beyond thresholds, with collateral posted appearing in prepaid expenses and collateral received in accrued expenses. The broader risk mitigation context (page 68) reinforces the strategic use of these agreements within master netting arrangements to reduce credit exposure, aligning with Adobe\u2019s overall derivative strategy that includes both cash flow hedges and non-designated hedges. Together, these sections show a comprehensive framework where collateral agreements serve as a financial safeguard in Adobe\u2019s foreign exchange risk management.",

As of December 3, 2021, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2022. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 3, 2021. This sensitivity analysis  measures  the  hypothetical  market  value  resulting  from  a  10%  shift  in  the  value  of  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $172 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $76 million.\n\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nWe may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.\n\nWe enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting  arrangements.  We  also  enter  into  collateral  security  agreements  with  certain  of  our  counterparties  to  exchange  cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted  is  included  in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  and  collateral  received  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  on  our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nIn  countries  outside  the  United  States,  we  transact  business  in  U.S.  Dollars  and  in  various  other  currencies. We  may  use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These  foreign  exchange  contracts,  carried  at  fair  value,  have  maturities  of  up  to  twelve  months. As  of  December  3,  2021  and November 27, 2020, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $2.06 billion and $1.53 billion, respectively, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars.\n\nIn  June  2019,  we  entered  into  Treasury  lock  agreements  with  large  financial  institutions  which  fixed  benchmark  U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedged the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and were settled upon debt issuance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We incurred a loss related to the settlement of the instruments which is amortized to interest expense over the term of our debt due February 1, 2030. See Note 17 for further details regarding our debt.\n\nAs of December 3, 2021, we had net derivative gains on our foreign exchange option contracts expected to be recognized within the next 18 months, of which $56 million of gains are expected to be recognized into revenue within the next 12 months. In addition,  we  had  net  derivative  losses  on  our Treasury  lock  agreements,  of  which  $4  million  is  expected  to  be  recognized  into interest expense within the next 12 months.\n\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency and Treasury lock cash flow hedges to revenue and interest expense, respectively. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge  from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  to  the  same  income  statement  line  item  as  the  hedged  item.  We evaluate  hedge  effectiveness  at  the  inception  of  the  hedge  prospectively,  and  on  an  ongoing  basis  both  retrospectively  and prospectively. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.\n\nEffective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, all changes in fair value of our foreign currency cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Prior to this, we recorded the time value of purchased contracts in other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The impact of the de-designation of our hedges due to the change in methodology in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was not material.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no net gains or losses recognized in income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\n\n## Non-Designated Hedges\n\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The changes in fair value of these",

When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is reissued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent that there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Advertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $540 million, $362 million and $221 million, respectively.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nWe translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency, at exchange rates in  effect  at  the  balance  sheet  date.  We  translate  revenue  and  expenses  at  the  monthly  average  exchange  rates.  We  include accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nIn  countries  outside  the  United  States,  we  transact  business  in  U.S.  Dollars  and  in  various  other  currencies. We  may  use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue primarily  in  Euros,  British  Pounds,  Japanese  Yen  and  Australian  Dollars.  Additionally,  we  hedge  our  net  recognized  foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.\n\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair  value.  Gains  and  losses  resulting  from  changes  in  fair  value  are  accounted  for  depending  on  the  use  of  the  derivative  and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair value through earnings.\n\nGains and losses related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each period as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements  of  Income.  Foreign  exchange  option  contracts  hedging  forecasted  foreign  currency  revenue  and  Treasury  lock agreements are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  until  the  forecasted  transaction  occurs.  When  the  forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency and Treasury lock cash flow hedges to revenue and interest expense, respectively.\n\n## Concentration of Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.\n\nOur investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy. Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these investments.\n\nWe enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties",

      "question": "How does Salesforce\u2019s $5.0 billion Revolving Loan Credit Agreement factor into its liquidity position, debt obligations, and strategic flexibility given the absence of current borrowings, the existence of significant repurchase authorizations, and the risks associated with global economic uncertainty?",
      "answer": "Salesforce\u2019s $5.0 billion Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which matures in October 2029, serves as a key source of liquidity despite no outstanding borrowings as of January 31, 2025, and complements its $30.0 billion share repurchase program. However, the company also faces significant debt service obligations and lease commitments, which could constrain its ability to secure additional financing or withstand economic volatility, particularly amid fluctuating currency exchange rates and geopolitical instability. While the Credit Facility provides strategic flexibility, Salesforce\u2019s ability to leverage it effectively will depend on maintaining compliance with covenants and managing risks from global macroeconomic conditions.",

Furthermore, governments' responses to macroeconomic factors and tax revenue needs may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.\n\n## We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies.\n\nWe primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency ex change rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.\n\nAdditionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East, fluctuating commodity prices, uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and inflation, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Our debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes. We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $5.0 billion Credit Facility. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025, we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\n\nIn addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, including leases that have not yet commenced and commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:\n\n- impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital ex penditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n- cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments; and\n- make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\n\nOur ability to meet our ex penses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business.\n\nIn addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact our reputation, the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\n\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in",

However, the company acknowledges (page 20) that as AI becomes more integrated into enterprise platforms, competitors may adopt AI more efficiently, disrupting workforce needs and reducing demand for Salesforce\u2019s offerings, including Data Cloud. Additionally, Salesforce operates Data Cloud under a consumption-based business model (page 17), which introduces financial risks due to limited experience in pricing such contracts and customer flexibility in timing of consumption, potentially leading to suboptimal revenue outcomes.

Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to a different enterprise software service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise applications delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;\n- software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization;\n- vendors who offer software tailored to specific services, industries or market segments, as opposed to our full suite of service offerings, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors, e-commerce solutions vendors or AI software and service vendors;\n- productivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market; and\n- traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications, including AI-augmented applications, that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services, as well as would-be customers who may develop enterprise applications for internal use.\n\nIn addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings. Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands and offer more targeted and simplified solutions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or provide competitive pricing, more flexible contracts or faster implementations. Additionally, as we continue to increase building AI into many of our offerings, we face more competition as AI technologies are increasingly integrated into the markets in which we compete. New AI offerings may disrupt workforce needs and negatively impact demand for our offerings, or our competitors may be able to incorporate AI into their offerings more efficiently or successfully than we are able to and achieve greater and faster adoption. Even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business.\n\nOur efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.\n\nOur efforts to ex pand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. In addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumption-based contracts. Further, the introduction of future platform changes and upgrades may not result in long term revenue growth.\n\nIf we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including its timely completion, introduction and market acceptance, as well as our ability to integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues.

If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline.\n\nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer. If customer usage of certain consumption-based offerings is below expected levels, our revenue could decline. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates or optimal pricing for consumption-based contracts, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services, particularly in times of general economic uncertainty. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of various factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers' spending levels, mix  of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes, such as the increased prevalence of consumption-based pricing models and economic downturns.\n\nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and customer receptiveness to any price changes related to these additional features and services.\n\nIn addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumptionbased contracts.\n\n## Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.\n\nWe periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Such sales organization changes have in some periods resulted in, and may in the future result in, a reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth in the current and future quarters and operating results, including revenue. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth.\n\n## Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations.\n\nWe sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. We intend to seek to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States or those that can affect international operations generally, include:\n\n- regional economic and political conditions, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergencies;\n- localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n- regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors;",

      "answer": "Salesforce strategically invests in enterprise cloud companies to expand its solution ecosystem, accelerate innovation, and deepen customer relationships by integrating complementary technologies (page 8). However, as disclosed in the financial section, Salesforce holds multiple private investments in this space, with four such companies accounting for 24% of the strategic investment portfolio as of January 31, 2025 (page 67), indicating a concentrated exposure. These investments carry inherent risk, including potential partial or total loss of capital, volatility in returns due to market conditions, and challenges in timing liquidity events (page 21). Thus, Salesforce's rationale combines ecosystem expansion with calculated risk-taking, acknowledging that while these investments may drive long-term strategic value, they also expose the company to financial volatility and execution risks.",

We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. We orient our business strategy and invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities:\n\nExpand relationships with existing customers. We see significant opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships through cross-selling and upselling our service offerings. For example, we continue to focus on driving multiple service offering adoption, which provides our customers with a one-stop-shop for their front-office business technology needs. As our customers realize the benefits of our entire suite of service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customers' ex perience with new products and features and gain additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units. Finally, we aim to ex pand our relationships with ex isting customers through our additional support offerings.\n\nIncrease geographic reach. By extending our go-to-market capabilities globally, we aim to grow our business by selling to new customers in new regions. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in most major markets globally. We also plan to continue to develop distribution channels through new and existing marketplaces and partners for our solutions around the globe and new goto-market strategies. We continue to invest in our domestic and international operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world.\n\nFocus on industries and new products. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative and value-driven solutions in new categories based on our existing and potential customers' needs. For example, we provide out-of-the-box solutions specifically built for customers in certain industries, such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing and more. In addition, through direct discussions and strategic engagements with our customers, we are able to deliver the innovations and enhancements that align with the needs of our customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform for deploying autonomous AI agents across any business function. Agentforce includes a set of tools to create and customize AI agents, as well as a library of ready-to-use skills for any use case across sales, service, marketing and commerce, Tableau, Slack, partners and more.\n\nLeverage our partner ecosystem. The Salesforce Platform enables customers, independent software vendors ('ISVs') and third-party developers to create, test and deliver cloud-based applications. These applications can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by software vendors. In addition, we rely on our consulting partners to deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, from large-scale implementations to more limited solutions that help businesses run more efficiently. We continue to work with and invest in our partner ecosystem, including these ISVs and system integrators ('SIs'), to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries.\n\nPromote strong customer adoption and reduce customer attrition. We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. Our customer success programs, including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists, help enable and accelerate our customers' digital transformations. In addition, we have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies learn our systems and a community of Trailblazers who drive innovation. With these programs and resources, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions.\n\n## Mergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our Salesforce Platform. Our evaluation seeks to confirm that any potential acquisition accelerates our strategy, represents an attractive customer opportunity, provides a pathway to effectively monetize the acquired products and drive significant operational efficiencies and presents a clear timeline for value accretion. Our acquisitions can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and accelerate development of features to large-scale acquisitions that result in new service offerings. Our goal is to prioritize the use of our balance sheet, through cash and debt, to complete acquisitions.\n\nWe also manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and SIs. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company's initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, including AI. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find attractive, including investments in companies representing targeted businesses, technological initiatives and geographies. Our strategy includes growing our strategic investment portfolio, in part, by reinvesting proceeds from the sales of strategic investments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments\n\nThe Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company's marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investmentgrade securities and the Company's policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n\nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were 17 percent and 16 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were 81 percent and 82 percent of total assets, respectively.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 24 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2024, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 16 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company's enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, 'Cloud Services'), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n\n- identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\n\nSubscription and Support Revenues\n\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement.\n\nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company's subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\n\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized",

We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely.\n\nAdditionally, if we fail to timely anticipate or identify significant technology trends and developments, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. Uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, modifications to existing platforms or technologies, including text messaging capabilities, or changes in customer usage patterns thereof could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.\n\n## Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.\n\nWe believe that the brand identities we have developed, including associations with trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands is critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength, particularly for our core services, depends largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and to continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services and features in a secure, reliable manner that enhances our customers' success even as we scale and expand our services. In order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands, we have made and may in the future make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services, or we may enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\n\nIn addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand.\n\nFurther, entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact our ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur ex cessive ex penses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital. Significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nWe manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. While we invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, advancing responsible generative AI, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, we may still ex perience unforeseen brand or reputational harm associated with our investments. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company's initial public offering. Investments in early stage companies are inherently speculative, as these companies may not yet be revenue-generating and could still be in the process of developing their products and services at the time of our investment. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. Our investments may face challenges from regulatory authorities, including antitrust authorities, potentially resulting in unex pected costs, delays, or unfavorable conditions imposed on transactions involving our investment portfolio. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.\n\nWe are exposed to volatility in our operating results due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments of our strategic investments. The measurement of our nonmarketable equity and debt securities at fair value is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation. The resulting gains or losses could be material depending on market conditions and events, particularly in periods with economic uncertainty, inflation, geopolitical conflict, volatile public equity markets or unsettled global market conditions.\n\n## If third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed.\n\nOur success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security or integrity of the data access, transmission or processing.

This innovation reinforces the Salesforce Platform as the unifying foundation of the company's offerings, which is central to its strategic positioning (page 5). Despite expanding its product capabilities through features like Agentforce, Salesforce continues to operate as a single operating segment because most of its offerings run on the Salesforce Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner (page 66). This reflects a deliberate alignment between product innovation and financial reporting, where the platform's centrality supports a consolidated business model evaluated on a net income basis by the CODM.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (the 'Company') is a global leader in customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together. With the deeply unified Salesforce Platform, the Company delivers a single source of truth, connecting customer data with integrated artificial intelligence ('AI') across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and conduct commerce from anywhere. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company introduced Agentforce, a new layer of the trusted Salesforce Platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. Since its founding in 1999, the Company has pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and AI, enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the digital-first world.\n\n## Fiscal Year\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:\n\n- the standalone selling price ('SSP') of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;\n- the valuation of privately-held strategic investments;\n- the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;\n- the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;\n- the useful lives of intangible assets; and\n- the fair value of certain stock awards issued.\n\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses to be recognized.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ('CODM'), who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions which have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company's business operates in one operating segment because most of the Company's service offerings operate on the Salesforce Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner, and the Company's CODM evaluates the Company's financial information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated net income basis. Additionally, the measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.\n\nThe Company's significant segment expenses, which are the expenses included in operating income as well as losses on strategic investments, and other segment items, which includes other income (expense) and benefit from (provision for) income taxes, are included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, further components of the Company's measure of profit or loss, which is net income, are included throughout the Company's financial statements.\n\n## Salesforce, Inc.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's $45.3 billion cumulative R&D investment in technologies like CUDA align with its risk exposure from relying on third-party developers to build applications that leverage the platform?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA has invested over $45.3 billion in R&D since inception (page 4), with CUDA being a foundational technology introduced in 2006 that underpins its full-stack computing infrastructure. However, the company faces material risk if third-party developers and partners fail to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage CUDA and other NVIDIA platforms (page 18). This creates a strategic tension: while NVIDIA has heavily invested in creating the CUDA ecosystem and its underlying technology, its business outcomes depend significantly on external developers adopting and extending the platform. The risk section explicitly states that failure by third parties to develop applications on NVIDIA's platforms could adversely affect customer demand, directly challenging the business value derived from NVIDIA's R&D investments in CUDA and related technologies.",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's risk exposure to cloud service providers (CSPs) from geopolitical and climate-related disruptions align with their strategic reliance on CSPs for scaling AI cloud services and expanding enterprise offerings?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA identifies CSPs as critical to both their operational resilience and strategic growth. From a risk perspective, NVIDIA acknowledges that interruptions or delays in services from CSPs could impair their ability to deliver products and services, especially given increasing reliance on these third-party systems (page 22). This risk is amplified by geopolitical conflicts, such as in Israel, and climate-related disruptions affecting data centers, which depend on stable energy and water supplies. On the strategic side, NVIDIA has partnered with CSPs to deploy NVIDIA DGX Cloud services and AI Foundations, indicating a deliberate move to scale enterprise AI offerings through CSP-hosted infrastructure (page 15). Additionally, CSPs are part of NVIDIA\u2019s global partner network, where solution architects work closely with them to optimize infrastructure for generative AI and LLM deployment (page 8). This dual framing\u2014CSPs as both a vulnerability and a growth enabler\u2014shows a nuanced dependency where operational risks must be managed alongside strategic expansion goals.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NVDA](page_22) \u2192 [CSPs]: CSPs are discussed as a risk due to potential service interruptions from geopolitical and climate-related events, which could impair NVIDIA\u2019s ability to deliver products and services.",
        "Hop 2: [NVDA](page_8) \u2192 [CSPs]: CSPs are part of NVIDIA\u2019s global partner network and are actively engaged to optimize hardware and software infrastructure for generative AI and LLM deployment, indicating strategic collaboration.",
        "Hop 3: [NVDA](page_15) \u2192 [CSPs]: CSPs are key to NVIDIA\u2019s enterprise cloud offerings like DGX Cloud and AI Foundations, with multi-year agreements supporting these services and research activities."

      "question": "How does Intel's funding approach for the US Retiree Medical Plan align with its investment strategy and benefit obligations, given the plan's funded status and expected future payment requirements?",
      "answer": "Intel's funding of the US Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary, and as of December 25, 2021, the plan was 68% funded globally, with $669 million in assets against a $682 million projected benefit obligation. Intel's investment strategy focuses on liquid assets, primarily allocated across global equities (65%) and fixed income (35%), aiming to match expected near-term benefit payments. Despite the plan's underfunded status, Intel's discretionary funding approach allows flexibility, as seen in 2021 when assets increased by $69 million year-over-year, suggesting a strategic balance between risk and liquidity to meet upcoming obligations.",

Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the US Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations; additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate.\n\nOn a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 68% funded as of December 25, 2021. The US Pension Plan, which accounts for 28% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 99% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for US retirement plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the US Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.\n\n## Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was $162 million in 2021 ($164 million in 2020 and $135 million in 2019).\n\n## Pension Plan Assets\n\n",

The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees.\n\nWe expensed $444 million in 2021 and $398 million in 2020 for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Prior to 2020, the contributions were discretionary and we expensed $379 million in 2019.\n\n## US Retiree Medical Plan\n\nUpon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree Medical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.\n\nAs of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, the projected benefit obligation was $682 million and $741 million, which used the discount rate of 2.8% and 2.4%. The December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $669 million and $600 million.\n\nThe investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 65% equity and 35% fixed income investments. As of December 25, 2021, the majority of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in fixed income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.\n\nThe estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Intel's classification and valuation methodology for financial institution instruments in its fair value disclosures align with their treatment in trading assets and available-for-sale investments, particularly in terms of fair value hierarchy levels and unrealized gains or losses?",
      "answer": "Intel classifies financial institution instruments across multiple categories including cash equivalents, trading assets, and available-for-sale investments. In 2021, financial institution instruments held as cash equivalents totaled $1,979 million, with $1,216 million measured at Level 1 and $763 million at Level 2 (page_99). These instruments are part of broader trading assets, where Intel recorded net losses of $606 million in 2021, offset by net gains on related derivatives of $609 million (page_92). The fair value hierarchy methodology, which includes Level 1 (quoted prices), Level 2 (observable inputs), and Level 3 (unobservable inputs), is consistently applied across these classifications, as described in the fair value section (page_80). This alignment shows how Intel values and manages financial institution instruments across different investment strategies and risk profiles.",

          "chunk_text": "The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.\n\nAssets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use nonbinding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Debt Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nMarketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n78",

Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.\n\nWe regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 could decrease by as much as $327 million in the next 12 months.\n\nWe file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. Excluding pre-acquisition Altera tax years, we are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 2013. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2014.\n\n## Note 9 : Investments\n\n## Debt Investments\n\n## Trading Assets\n\nFor trading assets still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $606 million in 2021 (net gains of $694 million in 2020 and net gains of $26 million in 2019).

      "question": "How did Intel balance the short-term gains with long-term valuation risks in its investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. as disclosed in its 2022 10-K filing for the fiscal year 2021 ended December 25, 2021?",
      "answer": "In the first quarter of 2021, Intel recognized a short-term gain of $471 million from observable price adjustments in its investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. (Unisoc), indicating a positive near-term valuation movement. However, Intel also acknowledged long-term valuation risks tied to this investment, as disclosed in its 2022 10-K filing. As of December 25, 2021, Intel held a non-marketable equity investment in Unisoc with a carrying value of $1.1 billion, up from $658 million the previous year. This increase in value was exposed to market volatility, as Intel noted that a hypothetical 60% decline in market prices could reduce the aggregate value of its marketable equity securities by approximately $1.3 billion. This risk analysis extended to non-marketable investments like Unisoc, where Intel emphasized the speculative nature of such investments and the potential for significant losses due to market conditions, limited liquidity, and the uncertain success of the investee company. Thus, while Intel benefited from a substantial short-term gain, the filing reveals a cautious outlook regarding the long-term stability and value of the Unisoc investment.",

          "chunk_text": "As of December 25, 2021, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $2.2 billion ($1.8 billion as of December 26, 2020). The substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 25, 2021 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 60% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $1.3 billion, based on the value as of December 25, 2021 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.1 billion, based on the value as of December 26, 2020 using an assumed decline of 60%).\n\nWe utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.\n\nMany of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 ($3.3 billion as of December 26, 2020) and includes our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion ($658 million as of December 26, 2020).\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities.\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nWhen any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&amp;A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.\n\n## Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results.\n\nDemand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products, can reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\n\nImportant factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n\n- business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;\n- consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n- geopolitical conditions, including trade policies;\n- our ability to timely introduce competitive products;\n- competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n- the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;\n- customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the ongoing industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;\n- market acceptance and industry support of our products, including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our products; and\n- customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as work- and learn-from-home trends.\n\nOther Key Information\n\n50",

      "answer": "Microsoft recognizes revenue from Volume Licensing Programs, including Enterprise Agreements with Software Assurance (SA), ratably over the contract period due to the ongoing benefits provided through SA. These programs are a key driver of the Intelligent Cloud segment's revenue, particularly for server products, which are sold through volume licensing and affect financial performance. Additionally, unearned revenue related to these programs is invoiced annually and recognized over time, reflecting the long-term contractual nature of these agreements and contributing to revenue visibility and stability.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 8\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer  of  control  of  promised  products  or  services  to  customers  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Nature of Products and Services\n\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer.  Customers  may  purchase  perpetual  licenses  or  subscribe  to  licenses,  which  provide  customers  with  the  same functionality  and  differ  mainly  in  the  duration  over  which  the  customer  benefits  from  the  software.  Revenue  from  distinct  onpremises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we  allocate  revenue  to  software  updates,  primarily  because  the  updates  are  provided  at  no  additional  charge,  revenue  is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\n\nCertain  volume  licensing  programs,  including  Enterprise  Agreements,  include  on-premises  licenses  combined  with  Software Assurance ('SA'). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and  training  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  products  more  efficiently.  On-premises  licenses  are  considered  distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers  simultaneously  consume  and  receive  benefits,  given  that  SA  comprises  distinct  performance  obligations  that  are satisfied over time.\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is  recognized  based  on  the  customer  utilization  of  such  resources.  When  cloud  services require  a  significant  level  of  integration  and  interdependency  with  software  and  the  individual  components  are  not  considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nRevenue  from  search  advertising  is  recognized  when  the  advertisement  appears  in  the  search  results  or  when  the  action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\n\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.\n\n## Significant Judgments\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a  customer.  Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.",

This segment primarily comprises:\n\n- Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n- Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance professional services.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform  or  device.  Customers  can  use Azure  through  our  global  network  of  datacenters  for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-aservice consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nOur server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating  system.  This  includes  the  server  platform,  database,  business  intelligence,  storage,  management  and  operations, virtualization,  service-oriented  architecture  platform,  security,  and  identity  software.  We  also  license  standalone  and  software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform  and  code  hosting  service  for  developers.  Server  products  revenue  is  mainly  affected  by  purchases  through  volume licensing  programs,  licenses  sold  to  original  equipment  manufacturers  ('OEM'),  and  retail  packaged  products.  CALs  provide access  rights  to  certain  server  products,  including  SQL  Server  and  Windows  Server,  and  revenue  is  reported  along  with  the associated server product.\n\nNuance and GitHub include both cloud and on-premises offerings. Nuance provides healthcare and enterprise AI solutions. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers.\n\n## Enterprise Services\n\nEnterprise  Services,  including  Enterprise  Support  Services,  Microsoft  Consulting  Services,  and  Nuance  Professional  Services, assist  customers  in  developing,  deploying,  and  managing  Microsoft  server  solutions,  Microsoft  desktop  solutions,  and  Nuance conversational  AI  and  ambient  intelligent  solutions,  along  with  providing  training  and  certification  to  developers  and  IT professionals on various Microsoft products.\n\n## Competition\n\nAzure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure's competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud's global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.\n\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own  versions  of  the  Unix  operating  system  preinstalled  on  server  hardware.  Nearly  all  computer  manufacturers  offer  server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux  has  also  benefited  from  the  large  number  of  compatible  applications  now  produced  by  many  commercial  and  noncommercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's strategic emphasis on Office 365 as a foundational productivity and collaboration tool is evident in its corporate vision, where it is positioned as central to enabling hybrid work and integrated with Microsoft 365, Teams, and LinkedIn. Financially, Office 365 is recognized ratably over time as part of a bundled cloud service due to its integration with desktop applications, which affects how its revenue is reported. Operationally, Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 18% year-over-year, contributing to the broader Microsoft Cloud revenue of $91.2 billion, which increased 32%. This alignment shows that Office 365 is both a strategic and financial pillar, with its bundled delivery model influencing long-term revenue streams while supporting Microsoft\u2019s broader cloud and productivity ambitions.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## Other Planned Uses of Capital\n\nOn January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. ('Activision Blizzard') for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard's net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard's shareholders, and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well  as  continue  making  acquisitions  that  align  with  our  business  strategy. Additions  to  property  and  equipment  will  continue, including  new  facilities,  datacenters,  and  computer  systems  for  research  and  development,  sales  and  marketing,  support,  and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating  and  finance  leases  for  datacenters,  corporate  offices,  research  and  development  facilities,  Microsoft  Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nRefer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty  and  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.  We  have  critical  accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a  customer.  Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price ('SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.",

We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\n## The Ambitions That Drive Us\n\nTo achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:\n\n- Reinvent productivity and business processes.\n- Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.\n- Create more personal computing.\n\n## Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes\n\nAt Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment. Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.\n\nOur growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and  services,  including  Office  365,  Dynamics  365,  and  LinkedIn.  Microsoft  365  brings  together  Office  365,  Windows,  and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase collaboration,  and  fuel  innovation,  all  the  while  enabling  compliance  coverage  and  data  protection.  Microsoft  Teams  is  a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience  platform  that  brings  together  communications,  knowledge,  learning,  resources,  and  insights  powered  by Microsoft  365.  Together  with  the  Microsoft  Cloud,  Dynamics  365,  Microsoft  Teams,  and  Azure  Synapse  bring  a  new  era  of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. In a dynamic labor market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired.\n\n## Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform\n\nAs  digital  transformation  accelerates,  organizations  in  every  sector  across  the  globe  can  address  challenges  that  will  have  a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. Microsoft has a proven track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets.\n\nWe continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while offering  openness,  improving  time  to  value,  reducing  costs,  and  increasing  agility.  Being  a  global-scale  cloud, Azure  uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices,  from  Internet  of  Things  ('IoT')  sensors  to  gateway  devices  and  edge  hardware  to  build,  manage,  and  secure  edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge.",

      "answer": "Broadcom's acquisition of VMware for $30.8 billion in cash and $53.4 billion in stock was strategically aimed at enhancing its Infrastructure Software Solutions portfolio, particularly to bolster capabilities in hybrid cloud environments. This aligns with Broadcom\u2019s broader strategy to deliver modernized, secure, and scalable infrastructure technology solutions for mission-critical workloads across private and hybrid cloud platforms. The acquisition was integrated into the Infrastructure Software segment, which is central to Broadcom\u2019s positioning as a leader in managing complex IT environments. Financially, the 53-week fiscal year 2024, which included an additional week of operations compared to the prior 52-week year, contributed to higher net revenue and operating expenses, partly driven by VMware\u2019s inclusion starting November 22, 2023.

      "question": "Given Broadcom's semiconductor revenue concentration in the Asia Pacific region ($23.263 billion in fiscal 2023), how does the company's strategic focus on semiconductor innovation and its acquisition of Seagate's SoC operations for $600 million align with its geographic revenue distribution to maintain its competitive position in semiconductor devices?",
      "answer": "Broadcom's semiconductor revenue is heavily concentrated in the Asia Pacific region, where it generated $23.263 billion in fiscal 2023, compared to $2.601 billion in the Americas and $2.027 billion in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This geographic revenue dominance in Asia Pacific underscores the region's critical role in supporting Broadcom's semiconductor business. The company's strategic focus on semiconductor innovation, as highlighted in its MD&A, includes significant internal R&D investments and external acquisitions. This is directly reflected in the acquisition of Seagate's System-on-Chip (SoC) operations for $600 million in April 2024. By acquiring SoC capabilities, Broadcom enhances its semiconductor device portfolio, particularly in areas like networking and storage, which aligns with the high demand in the Asia Pacific market. The combination of geographic revenue strength and targeted acquisitions like Seagate's SoC operations enables Broadcom to maintain its competitive position by reinforcing its technology leadership and product offerings in key markets where it already has strong revenue traction.",

      "answer": "Broadcom's acquisition of VMware significantly altered its financial structure and segment performance. The VMware merger contributed to a 192% increase in unallocated expenses, primarily due to higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and restructuring charges. The acquisition added $54,206 million in goodwill to the infrastructure software segment, reflecting the strategic intent to enhance Broadcom\u2019s software capabilities. This aligns with Broadcom\u2019s stated rationale to expand its infrastructure software offerings and position itself as a leader in hybrid cloud environments, indicating a long-term strategic pivot supported by short-term financial restructuring.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's $856 million increase in R&D spending on 5G and wireless technologies align with its exposure to China-related regulatory risks and its projected growth opportunities in automotive and IoT markets?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm increased R&D spending by $856 million in fiscal 2022 for wireless and integrated circuit technologies, including 5G, reflecting a strategic push to drive innovation and maintain leadership in next-generation connectivity. However, this investment faces headwinds from regulatory risks in China, where Qualcomm has significant revenue concentration. U.S.-China trade tensions could restrict Qualcomm's ability to sell to Chinese OEMs or receive payments from Chinese licensees, potentially undermining returns on its 5G R&D. At the same time, Qualcomm is targeting growth in automotive and IoT markets\u2014where 5G is expected to play a foundational role\u2014projecting that over 60% of new vehicles in 2028 will feature 5G connectivity and that IoT device installations will surpass 27 billion by 2026. These long-term opportunities, however, are tempered by the automotive industry's long design-in cycles, regulatory compliance requirements, and high barriers to entry, which could delay the monetization of Qualcomm\u2019s current R&D investments.",

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese OEMs; our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices into China that incorporate our integrated circuit products; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to Chinese OEMs or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\nFinally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n\nWhile we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n\nIn particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing new products and technologies for these product areas, industries and applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies.\n\nHowever, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new technologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; alternate technologies or products may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors' technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or be brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns.\n\nFurther, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs.\n\nIf our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality and/or regulatory standards of a particular industry or application (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited.\n\nIn addition, in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models and transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.",

Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese OEMs; our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices into China that incorporate our integrated circuit products; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to Chinese OEMs or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\nFinally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n\nWhile we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\n\nIn particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing new products and technologies for these product areas, industries and applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies.\n\nHowever, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new technologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; alternate technologies or products may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors' technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or be brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns.\n\nFurther, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs.\n\nIf our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality and/or regulatory standards of a particular industry or application (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited.\n\nIn addition, in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models and transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nWe are a global leader in the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry. Our technologies and products are used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including those used in the internet of things (IoT) and automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and advanced driver assistance and automated driving (ADAS/AD). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and through the licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results of Qualcomm, its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (Note 9). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nFinancial Statement Preparation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Examples of our significant accounting estimates and policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others include: the estimation of sales-based royalty revenues; the impairment of non-marketable equity investments; the valuation of inventories; the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the recognition, measurement and disclosure of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings; and the calculation of our income tax provision, including the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nFiscal Year. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. The fiscal years presented each included 52 weeks.\n\nCash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and notes, certain bank time and demand deposits and government agencies' securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\n\nMarketable Securities. Marketable securities include marketable equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities and, from time-to-time, certain time deposits. We classify marketable securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. Debt securities are classified as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase and reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nIf a debt security has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security. For the remaining debt securities, if an unrealized loss exists, we separate the impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factors and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factors. Unrealized gains or unrealized losses that are not related to credit factors on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities and subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment and other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and economy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\n\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with equity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in net earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. We monitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee's financial condition and business forecasts and lower valuations in recently completed or anticipated financings, and recognize a charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value.

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's strategic emphasis on integrated circuit products, including their Snapdragon family of chips, align with the $24.5 billion in supplier obligations tied to these products, and how might this commitment impact their financial flexibility as discussed in forward-looking statements?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's strategic emphasis on integrated circuit products, particularly their Snapdragon family of chips, is a core element of their business model, as stated in the Business section (page 6). This strategic focus is operationally manifested through significant supplier obligations\u2014totaling $24.5 billion as of fiscal year-end 2022\u2014specifically tied to the manufacturing of these products, including commitments for raw materials, semiconductor die, and manufacturing services (page 82). These supplier obligations, while critical to maintaining production capacity and meeting anticipated demand, also introduce financial risk. As noted in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (page 39), forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those related to supply chain commitments. Cancellation of these purchase commitments may result in incurred costs or penalties, which could constrain financial flexibility and materially affect results of operations if demand does not align with these commitments. Thus, while the supplier obligations support Qualcomm\u2019s strategic positioning in wireless technologies, they also expose the company to supply-side risk that must be carefully managed.",

Business\n\nWe incorporated in California in 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1991. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Our 52-week fiscal years consist of four equal fiscal quarters of 13 weeks each, and our 53-week fiscal years consist of three 13-week fiscal quarters and one 14-week fiscal quarter. The financial results for our 53-week fiscal years and our 14-week fiscal quarters will not be exactly comparable to our 52-week fiscal years and our 13-week fiscal quarters. Our fiscal years for 2022, 2021 and 2020 included 52 weeks.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global leader in the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless technologies and processor technologies including high-performance, low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Our technologies and products are used in mobile devices and other wireless products. Our inventions have helped power the growth in smartphones and other cellular enabled devices. As a connected processor company, we are scaling our innovations using our one technology roadmap to enable the connected intelligent edge (the next generation of smart devices) across industries and applications beyond handsets, including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). In IoT, our inventions have helped power growth in industries and applications such as consumer (including computing, voice and music and XR), edge networking (including mobile broadband and wireless access points) and industrial (including handhelds, retail, transportation and logistics and utilities). In automotive, our connectivity, digital cockpit and advanced driver assistance and automated driving (ADAS/AD) platforms are helping to connect the car to its environment and the cloud, create unique in-cabin experiences and enable a comprehensive assisted and automated driving solution. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, including our Snapdragon\u00ae family of highly-integrated, system-based solutions, and licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nThe foundational technologies we invent help power the modern mobile experience, impacting how the world connects, computes and communicates. We share these inventions broadly through our licensing programs enabling wide ecosystem access to technologies at the core of mobile innovation, and through the sale of our wireless integrated circuit platforms (also known as integrated circuit products, chips, chipsets or modules) and other products. We collaborate across the ecosystem, including with manufacturers, operators, developers, system integrators, cloud providers, test tool vendors, service providers, governments and industry standards organizations, to enable a global environment of continued progress and growth.\n\nWe have a long history of driving innovation. We have played and continue to play a leading role in developing system level inventions that serve as the foundation for 3G, 4G and 5G wireless technologies. This includes technologies such as CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) families of technologies, with the latter encompassing LTE (Long Term Evolution) and 5G NR (New Radio), which are the primary digital technologies currently used to transmit voice or data over radio waves using a public or private cellular wireless network.\n\nWe own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products that implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. The mobile industry generally recognizes that any",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a charge of $275 million to other expenses related to this EC fine. We provided a financial guarantee in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash payment while we appeal the EC's decision. The fine is accruing interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum while it is outstanding and included in other current liabilities.\n\nEuropean Commission (EC) Investigation: On October 15, 2014, the EC notified us that it was conducting an investigation of us relating to Articles 101 and/or 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). On January 24, 2018, the EC issued a decision finding that pursuant to an agreement with Apple Inc. we paid significant amounts to Apple on the condition that it exclusively use our baseband chipsets in its smartphones and tablets, reducing Apple's incentives to source baseband chipsets from our competitors and harming competition and innovation for certain baseband chipsets, and imposed a fine of 997 million euros. On April 6, 2018, we filed an appeal of the EC's decision with the General Court of the European Union. From May 4, 2021 to May 6, 2021, a hearing on our appeal was held before the court. On June 15, 2022, the court issued a ruling annulling the EC's decision in its entirety. The deadline for the EC to appeal the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice expired in August 2022. Consequently, the case is now over.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a charge of $1.2 billion to other expenses related to this EC fine. We provided financial guarantees in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash payment while we appealed the EC's decision. The fine accrued interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum while it was outstanding. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we designated the liability as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries, with gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of the foreign currency translation adjustment. As a result of the General Court's ruling, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded a $1.1 billion benefit in other income and a $62 million reduction in interest expense resulting from the reversal of the accrued fine and the associated interest previously recorded.\n\nContingent Losses and Other Considerations: We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the foregoing matters. However, litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain, and we face difficulties in evaluating or estimating likely outcomes or ranges of possible loss, particularly in antitrust and trade regulation investigations. Other than with respect to the EC fine related to the Icera Complaint to the European Commission, we have not recorded any accrual at September 25, 2022 for contingent losses associated with these matters based on our belief that losses, while reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible amount or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We are engaged in numerous other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of our business (for example, proceedings relating to employment matters or the initiation or defense of proceedings relating to intellectual property rights) and, while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIndemnifications . We generally do not indemnify our customers, licensees and suppliers for losses sustained from infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. However, we are contingently liable under certain agreements to defend and/or indemnify certain customers, licensees and suppliers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us. Claims and reimbursements under indemnification arrangements have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. We have not recorded accruals for certain claims under indemnification arrangements based on our belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n\nPurchase Obligations . We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021 were $3.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, of which $701 million and $90 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $3.1 billion and $1.6 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but may result in the payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation, and in some cases, incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance related to capacity underutilization and the failure to meet future minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 25, 2022 totaled $24.5 billion of which, $13.3 billion is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases were eight years and seven years, respectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $207 million, $203 million and $181 million,",

      "question": "How does Apple's revenue recognition policy for third-party app sales through the App Store reconcile with its reported growth in Services net sales and the strategic positioning of the App Store as a key digital content platform?",
      "answer": "Apple recognizes revenue from third-party app sales through the App Store on a net basis, only including the commission it retains in Services net sales, rather than the gross amount billed to customers. This aligns with the 2022 increase in Services net sales, which saw growth driven by advertising, cloud services, and notably, the App Store. Strategically, the App Store is positioned as a core digital content platform, alongside services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, reinforcing its role in driving recurring revenue and ecosystem engagement, despite the net revenue recognition treatment.",

          "chunk_text": "For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company  recognizes  revenue  based  on  the  gross  amount  billed  to  customers.  The  Company  considers  multiple  factors  when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company's other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\n\nThe  Company  records  revenue  net  of  taxes  collected  from  customers  that  are  remitted  to  governmental  authorities,  with  the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\n\n## Share-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date  of  grant,  and  recognizes  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  for  its  estimate  of  equity  awards  that  will  ultimately  vest.

The  offerings  provide priority  access  to  Apple  technical  support,  access  to  the  global  Apple  authorized  service  network  for  repair  and  replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \u00ae\n\n## Cloud Services\n\nThe  Company's  cloud  services  store  and  keep  customers'  content  up-to-date  and  available  across  multiple  Apple  devices  and Windows personal computers.\n\n## Digital Content\n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \u00ae\n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \u00ae SM \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Payment Services\n\nThe  Company offers  payment  services,  including  Apple  Card ,  a  co-branded  credit  card,  and  Apple  Pay ,  a  cashless  payment service. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Markets and Distribution\n\nThe  Company's  customers  are  primarily  in  the  consumer,  small  and  mid-sized  business,  education,  enterprise  and  government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales  force.  The  Company  also  employs  a  variety  of  indirect  distribution  channels,  such  as  third-party  cellular  network  carriers, wholesalers,  retailers  and  resellers.  During  2022,  the  Company's  net  sales  through  its  direct  and  indirect  distribution  channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property.\n\nThe Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products,  services  and  technologies  to  the  marketplace.  The  Company  designs  and  develops  nearly  the  entire  solution  for  its products,  including  the  hardware,  operating  system,  numerous  software  applications  and  related  services.  Principal  competitive factors  important  to  the  Company  include  price,  product  and  service  features  (including  security  features),  relative  price  and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.",

      "question": "How do Qualcomm's detailed discussions of SDO actions across its legal risk disclosures, risk factor summaries, and intellectual property enforcement strategies collectively indicate the potential financial and strategic impact of evolving SDO policies on Qualcomm's licensing business?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's legal risk disclosures on page 27 highlight that SDO actions, such as the adoption of policies limiting royalty rates or restricting remedies like injunctions for standard-essential patent infringement, could significantly reduce returns on intellectual property innovations. These proposed SDO changes, including apportioning royalty rates based on patent counts, directly threaten Qualcomm\u2019s licensing revenue model. On page 4, the risk factor summary reiterates that SDOs or other industry organizations could take actions that harm the business, emphasizing the strategic vulnerability of Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices to external policy shifts. Page 33 expands on this by noting that foreign jurisdictions and SDOs may adopt laws or policies that weaken Qualcomm\u2019s ability to enforce licensing agreements or collect royalties, particularly in Asia, where legal protections for intellectual property are weaker. Together, these perspectives reveal that evolving SDO policies pose a multi-faceted threat\u2014both financially, by reducing royalty income, and strategically, by undermining Qualcomm\u2019s ability to maintain control over its intellectual property and licensing terms.",

      "question": "How do U.S. national security policies impact Qualcomm's supply chain resilience, cost structure, and strategic acquisition plans, particularly given their emphasis on maintaining leadership in 5G and high-performance computing?",
      "answer": "U.S. national security policies significantly affect Qualcomm's supply chain resilience, cost structure, and strategic acquisition plans. In terms of supply chain resilience, trade restrictions and national security policies, particularly those involving China, limit or prevent Qualcomm from transacting with suppliers of critical integrated circuit products (page_22). This regulatory environment exacerbates vulnerabilities in Qualcomm's sole- or limited-source supplier arrangements, increasing the risk of supply disruptions and limiting the company's ability to procure critical components (page_23). Regarding cost structure, Qualcomm anticipates that transitions to new generations of leading process technology nodes will continue to drive product cost increases from key semiconductor wafer suppliers, a challenge compounded by geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions (page_45). On the acquisition front, strained U.S./China relations severely impact Qualcomm\u2019s ability to consummate transactions requiring approval from Chinese regulatory agencies, potentially limiting strategic expansion or diversification efforts (page_22). Collectively, these factors challenge Qualcomm\u2019s ability to maintain leadership in 5G and high-performance computing while managing costs and pursuing strategic growth opportunities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [QCOM](page_23) \u2192 [National Security Policies]: Trade or national security protection policies may eliminate or limit a supplier's ability to manufacture components for Qualcomm, increasing vulnerability in sole- or limited-source arrangements and limiting procurement of critical components.",
        "Hop 2: [QCOM](page_45) \u2192 [National Security Policies]: U.S./China trade relations and national security protection policies may negatively impact Qualcomm\u2019s business, growth prospects, and results of operations, particularly as the company emphasizes leadership in 5G and transitions to new process technology nodes that increase costs.",
        "Hop 3: [QCOM](page_22) \u2192 [National Security Policies]: Strained U.S./China relations severely impact Qualcomm\u2019s ability to secure regulatory approvals for acquisitions or strategic investments in China, limiting strategic expansion and exposing the company to potential fines, penalties, or divestiture requirements."

      "question": "How does Intel's strategic positioning of the 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors align with its R&D investments in advanced process technology and its broader product roadmap milestones, particularly in terms of AI acceleration capabilities and competitive differentiation?",
      "answer": "Intel's 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, launched in 2023 (page_28), are positioned as modular SoCs designed to meet growing AI, cloud, and enterprise demands, with built-in AI acceleration via Intel\u00ae Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). These capabilities align directly with Intel\u2019s R&D focus on heterogeneous computing and process innovation (page_14), particularly the Intel 7 process node used for these processors, which supports the integration of advanced features like AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and enhanced security. Furthermore, the launch of the 5th Gen Xeon Scalable processors is a key milestone in Intel\u2019s broader product roadmap (page_8), following the 4th Gen launch and coexisting with other leadership products like the Intel Core\u2122 Ultra and Intel Arc\u2122 GPUs. This strategic sequencing underscores Intel\u2019s intent to maintain a competitive edge in the data center by layering domain-specific acceleration into its CPU roadmap while leveraging advanced packaging and process technologies to deliver performance-per-watt improvements that support evolving AI workloads.",

      "answer": "Intel's strategic emphasis on xPU products, including GPUs, FPGAs, and accelerators, is central to its vision of delivering end-to-end compute solutions across data centers, edge computing, and AI. This strategic direction is reinforced by Intel's capital allocation priorities, which include significant R&D investment\u2014$16.0 billion in 2023 alone\u2014focused on xPU development, AI, and packaging technologies. However, Intel's IDM 2.0 and foundry expansion strategy, particularly through its IFS division, introduces substantial risk. The company faces intense competition from established players like TSMC and Samsung, and its ability to deliver leading-edge xPU products on time and with competitive performance per watt and density is uncertain due to historical delays in process technology (e.g., 10nm and 7nm). Thus, while xPU products are a strategic cornerstone, their successful development and market competitiveness depend heavily on Intel's ability to manage high-risk R&D and manufacturing investments in a capital-intensive and highly competitive environment.",

      "question": "How does Intel's exposure to financial institution instruments differ across its fair value disclosures, investment strategy, and derivative risk management framework, and what does this reveal about their overall approach to managing these instruments?",
      "answer": "Intel's exposure to financial institution instruments is detailed across three perspectives: (1) Fair value disclosures show that as of December 28, 2024, Intel held $4,864 million in financial institution instruments as part of cash equivalents and $3,551 million in short-term investments, indicating a significant allocation to these instruments. (2) Intel's investment strategy outlines that these instruments include commercial paper, bonds, and time deposits, primarily issued by non-U.S. institutions, and are either hedged or unhedged, with $13.5 billion in hedged marketable debt investments as of December 28, 2024. (3) In their derivative risk management, Intel uses interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to hedge risks associated with these instruments, particularly for hedged investments where fair value changes due to market fluctuations are offset by derivatives recorded in interest and other, net. Together, this reveals a strategy where Intel actively manages credit, interest rate, and currency risk for financial institution instruments through a combination of instrument selection, hedging, and fair value reporting.",

Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.\n\nWe regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2024, could decrease by as much as $314 million in the next 12 months.\n\nWe file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. We are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 2018 and 2015, respectively. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2015.\n\nNote 9 :\n\nInvestments\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nShort-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. A s of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US.\n\nThe fair value of our economically hedged marketable debt investments was $13.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($17.1 billion as of December 30, 2023). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $464 million in 2024 (net gains of $534 million in 2023 and net losses of $748 million in 2022).\n\nOur remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $5.2 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($4.7 billion as of December 30, 2023), which approximated the fair value for these periods.\n\nThe fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of December 28, 2024, was as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "- Non-marketable equity investments are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and property, plant, and equipment. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\n- Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery.\n\nImpairments of non-marketable equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net .\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nOur primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivativ e instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets , other long-term assets , other accrued liabilities , or other long-term liabilities .\n\nCash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency swaps, to hedge exposures for variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.\n\nThe after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net . Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.\n\nFair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair v alue of the underly ing hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net . Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within net cash provided by (used for) financing activities .\n\nNon-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, and non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as hedged investments. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as hedged investments. The change in fair value of non-designated derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net . Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives.\n\n## Debt Investments\n\nDebt investments include investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents . Unhedged debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and all economically hedged debt investments are classified as short-term investments , as they represent the investment of cash available for current operations.\n\nFor certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument, or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net . Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . We determine the cost of the investment sold at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net .\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n65",

      "question": "How does Intel's strategic positioning of the Xeon 6 processors with AI acceleration features, manufactured on the Intel 3 process, align with their marketing emphasis on AI Everywhere and competitive pressures from AMD and NVIDIA in the data center and AI markets?",
      "answer": "Intel's Xeon 6 processors, launched in 2024 and built on the Intel 3 process, are positioned as workload-optimized CPUs featuring AI acceleration in every core, including Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel AMX), to address growing data center and AI demands (page_17). These processors are part of a broader heterogeneous compute strategy that includes Gaudi 3 AI accelerators and software tools like OpenVINO to optimize AI workloads (page_9). Intel's marketing efforts in 2024 emphasized the AI Everywhere vision, with the Xeon 6 processors promoted alongside Intel Core Ultra processors as key enablers across data centers, cloud, edge, and PCs, supported by co-marketing initiatives and brand licensing programs (page_48). This aligns with Intel\u2019s response to competitive pressures from AMD\u2019s CPUs and GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s AI systems, and custom silicon entrants, by differentiating through system-level integration, built-in acceleration, and software ecosystems. However, the Intel 3 process node, while advanced, is not directly compared to TSMC\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s nodes used by competitors, leaving the quantitative performance and cost advantages unclear without further data.",

We launched our Intel Xeon  6 processors for the data center, utilizing the Intel 3 process, including our first Intel X eon processor using Efficient cores (E-cores). The Intel X eon 6 family is designed to address the growing diversity in workloads and deployments in the data center environments. Our 5th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processors, based on Intel 7, were launched in 2023, and continued to ramp throughout 2024. \u00ae \u00ae\n- Discrete client GPUs. The Intel Arc\u2122 graphics family offers modern GPU features to power immersive games, creator applications, and A I workloads. In 2024, we launched the Intel A rc B-Series based on the latest X e2 GPU architecture. The compute engine of the Intel A rc B-Series is our secondgeneration X -core, which delivers 70% more performance per core and is 50% more power efficient than the Intel A rc A 750. \u00ae e\n- Edge computing. We recently launched a suite of processors for edge computing. This includes the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series, bringing the NPU IP to desktops and reducing package power. These hybrid designs utilize our most advanced performance cores and power-efficient cores, as well as the latest packaging technology.\n- Datacenter AI accelerators and GPUs. In 2024, we launched the Intel Gaudi 3 A I accelerators offering significant price-performance advantages for A I inference applications. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nSoftware. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures.\n\nWe aim to optimize AI frameworks and middleware, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, vLLM , Hugging Face and WebNN to run efficiently on our hardware. Our OpenVINO\u2122 toolkit is an open source toolkit that accelerates deep learning inference on our processors across various use cases, such as generative A I, computer vision, audio, and language with industry standard models. It is used in domains from edge to A I PC to cloud and is the leading inferencing library on our silicon.\n\nIn 2024 we launched the Open Platform for Enterprise A I under the Linux Foundation to accelerate deployment of generative A I use cases through industry standard modular microservice architecture. Since launch, the ecosystem has been actively engaged, with an expanding network of partners enhancing features and developing new capabilities.\n\nMost of these frameworks and middleware are built from our oneAPI, which enables developers to create performant cross-architecture applications using a single code base across CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators. We contributed our oneAPI specifications and implementations to the UXL Foundation under the Linux Foundation. By doing so, oneAPI delivers an open and multi-vendor programming model enabling choice and code re-use across the accelerator hardware ecosystem.\n\nThis software stack is designed to preserve the usability of existing tools and software while accommodating future developments, enabling continuity for users and developers.\n\n## Areas Key to Process and Packaging Competitiveness\n\nOur leading-edge process and packaging technology continues to be key to the success of our strategy.\n\n- Intel 7 process node continues in production for our 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core processors. Intel 7 was utilized for a significant majority of our processor production and products in 2024, and is expected to continue to be utilized for a significant portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n\nOur Capital\n\n7",

          "chunk_text": "## Fundamentals of Our Business\n\nWe are a global designer and manufacturer of semiconductor products. The CPUs and other semiconductor solutions that we design, manufacture, market, and sell are incorporated in computing and related end products and services, and utilized globally by consumers, enterprises, governments, and educational organizations. Customers of our semiconductor products primarily include OEM s, ODM s, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. We market and sell our semiconductor products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We also develop semiconductor fabrication process and packaging technologies and manufacture many of our semiconductor product offerings at our geographically diverse network of fabrication and assembly and test facilities. We are also seeking to expand as a third-party foundry for external customers.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nTechnology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. A s we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see continued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, A I, and sensing. Together, these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other, and increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We harness these superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.\n\nWe are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, software, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product competitiveness, open platforms, manufacturing at scale, and our people.\n\n## Our Priorities\n\n## Product Competitiv eness\n\nLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to network, PCs, edge computing, and the emerging fields of A I and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.\n\nAt our core is the x86 ecosystem, which has served as a foundation of modern computing for over four decades. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance and efficiency. In 2024, we announced the creation of an advisory group to expand the x86 ecosystem by enabling compatibility across platforms, simplifying software development, and providing developers with a platform to identify architectural needs and features to create innovative and scalable solutions for the future.\n\nBeyond the CPU, we deliver a family of xPU products encompassing client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories.\n\nWe also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, from the largest, most challenging GenA I and large language models to emerging usages like A I PCs and AI at the edge. We believe A I represents a generational shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in the early stages of realizing A I's full potential. Our strategy  is to bring A I to where the data is being generated and used. We believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms that offer the open and modular solutions for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and A I everywhere. We are infusing A I into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenA I workloads, fueling emerging usages like A I PC and AI at the edge, and pioneering innovations that we believe will help advance the future of A I in the next decade.\n\nOur product offerings are predominantly manufactured in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. In recent years, however, we have strategically utilized third-party foundry manufacturing capacity where advantageous for cost, performance, schedule, or other reasons. This provides increased flexibility  and scale, including in recent y ears the ability  to continue to offer v arious products at the most performant end of the product spectrum where we did not yet have comparable process technologies in-house.\n\n## Open Platforms\n\nWe aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. A round the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. We have helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt\u2122, and PCI Express. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux, A ndroid, and others.\n\nOur Strategy\n\n3",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

      "question": "How does Intel's minority stake sale in IMS Nanofabrication in 2023 align with its broader capital allocation strategy and its ongoing commitment to consolidate IMS's financial results, despite reducing its ownership stake?",
      "answer": "Intel sold a 32% minority stake in IMS Nanofabrication in 2023, receiving $1.4 billion in proceeds and increasing capital in excess of par value by $958 million, while continuing to consolidate IMS's financial results. This aligns with Intel's broader capital allocation strategy of optimizing its portfolio and unlocking value, as stated in the overview of financial priorities, which emphasizes strategic divestitures and reinvestment in core initiatives. Despite the reduced ownership, the company retains control and operational integration of IMS, consistent with its approach to maintaining strategic assets while leveraging external investment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Semiconductor Co-Investment Program\n\n## Ireland SCIP\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we closed a transaction with A pollo Global M anagement, Inc. (A pollo) involving the sale of 49% of our interest in an Irish limited liability  company (Ireland SCIP) for net proceeds of $11.0 billion, which increased our capital in excess of par value. Ireland SCIP is a V IE that we consolidate into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, distributions will be received from Ireland SCIP based on both parties' proportional ownership. Ireland SCIP has the rights to operate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland, and has the rights to the related factory output. We have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP. We will retain sole ownership of Fab 34, will be engaged as the Fab 34 operator in exchange for variable payments from Ireland SCIP based on the related factory output, and will be required to maintain certain performance standards in our capacity as operator.\n\nWe are required to substantially complete construction of Fab 34 in accordance with contractual parameters and timelines or we will be required to pay delayrelated liquidated damages to A pollo beginning in 2026, not to exceed $1.1 billion in total. A s of December 28, 2024, we expect certain construction milestones for Fab 34 will be delayed as we refined our near-term production capacity requirements and related capital outlays relative to those that are required per the Ireland SCIP agreement. As a result, in 2024 we recognized a loss of $755 million within Interest and other, net from the change in fair value of the liquidated damage provisions, which qualify as a non-designated derivative. Refer to \"Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Though we expect certain construction delays in the near term, we intend to complete construction of Fab 34. We will be required to purchase minimum quantities of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP, or we will be subject to pay certain volume-related damages to Ireland SCIP, beginning at the earlier of when construction is complete or Q3 2027.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, other than cash and cash equivalents held by Ireland SCIP, substantially all of the remaining assets and liabilities of Ireland SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arizona SCIP\n\nWe consolidate the results of an A rizona limited liability company (A rizona SCIP), a V IE, into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from A rizona SCIP based on Intel's and Brookfield A sset M anagement's (Brookfield's) proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and main beneficiary of two new chip factories that will be constructed by A rizona SCIP, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to both operate A rizona SCIP at minimum production levels (measured in wafer starts per week) and limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain damages.\n\nWe have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of A rizona SCIP. The total construction costs were estimated at $29.0 billion when we entered into the definitive agreement with Brookfield in 2022.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, substantially all of the assets of A rizona SCIP consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The remaining assets and liabilities of Arizona SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The assets held by A rizona SCIP, which can be used only to settle obligations of the V IE and are not available to us, were $11.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($4.8 billion as of December 30, 2023).\n\n## Mobileye\n\nIn 2022, M obileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions. During 2023, we converted 38.5 million of our M obileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing 5% of M obileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A  shares for $42 per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of $1.6 billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by $663 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of M obileye into our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the third quarter of 2024, the non-cash impairment of goodwill related to our M obileye reporting unit was attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders based on our proportional ownership (see \"Note 11: Goodwill\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## IMS Nanofabrication\n\nIn 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined 32% minority stake in our IM S business, a business within our Intel Foundry operating segment-including a 20% stake to Bain Capital Special Situations and a 10% stake to TSM C. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by $958 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IM S into our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n73",

In 2024, we continued our focus on capital investment and the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy.\n\n## Return Excess Cash to Stockholders\n\nOur capital allocation strategy historically included returning excess cash to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Our most recent stock repurchase was in the first quarter of 2021 and we suspended the declaration of quarterly dividends starting with the fourth quarter of 2024. We agreed under our commercial CHIPS Act agreement to forgo paying dividends for the next two years, and agreed to limitations on the payment of dividends for the three years thereafter. Further, we do not expect to pay dividends or make stock repurchases until our cash flows improve as we focus on the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy and create long-term value.\n\n## Optimize our Portfolio and Unlock Value\n\nWe seek to drive value creation through transactions such as the 2022 IPO and 2023 secondary offering of M obileye stock, the 2023 minority stake sales in IM S, and the 2023 announcement of our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business, which we expect to enable potential private and public equity investments. Transactions like these provide additional capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our business strategy.\n\nOur capital allocation strategy also includes opportunistic investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that supplement and strengthen our capital and R&amp;D investments.\n\nLastly, we take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities or provide adequate returns to our stakeholders. In the last few years, we exited numerous businesses, including our NAND M emory business (first closing in 2021 and second closing expected in M arch 2025) and our Intel  Optane\u2122 memory business (2022). \u00ae\n\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" w ithin MD&amp;A. 1\n- 2021-2024 capital investments in Memory are not presented due to the divestiture of the NAND memory business w hich w e deconsolidated upon closing the first phase of the transaction on December 29, 2021. 2020 capital investments presented include Memory. 2\n\nOur Capital",

A n estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Note 3 : Operating Segments\n\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utiliz e marketing, sales, and other support functions.\n\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business. A ltera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" A s a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. A ll prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\n\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\n- Intel Products:\n- Client Computing Group (CCG)\n- Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n- Network and Edge (NEX)\n- Intel Foundry\n- All other:\n- Altera\n- Mobileye\n- Other\n\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX , A ltera, and M obileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\n\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A  summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:\n\n## Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\n- Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.\n- Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n68",

These cost of sales decreases were partially offset by $695 million of higher period charges in 2023, primarily related to excess capacity charges and higher intersegment inventory reserves taken in 2023.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses were $4.4 billion, down $214 million from 2022, driven by various cost-reduction measures.\n\n## All Other\n\nOur \"all other\" category includes the results of operations from other non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including our A ltera and M obileye businesses, start-up businesses that support our initiatives, and historical results of operations from divested businesses. A ltera offers programmable semiconductors, primarily FPGAs, and related products, for a broad range of applications across our embedded, communications, and cloud and enterprise market segments. We previously announced the organization of Altera as a standalone business. We are pursuing monetization opportunities with A ltera and remain focused on selling a stake in the business on its path to a potential IPO in the coming years.

      "answer": "Broadcom's revenue from semiconductor devices increased significantly across all regions from fiscal year 2020 to 2022, with the most pronounced growth in the Asia Pacific region, where revenue rose from $14.442 billion in 2020 to $21.761 billion in 2022. The Americas also saw strong growth, increasing from $1.775 billion to $2.371 billion, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa experienced a more modest rise from $1.218 billion to $2.145 billion.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## BROADCOM INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. Overview and Basis of Presentation\n\n## Overview\n\nBroadcom Inc. ('Broadcom'), a Delaware corporation, is a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security. We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Broadcom,' 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week year and the first Sunday in November in a 53-week year. Our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ('fiscal year 2022') was a 52week fiscal year. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended on January 30, 2022, the second quarter ended on May 1, 2022 and the third quarter ended on July 31, 2022. Our fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 ('fiscal year 2021') and fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 ('fiscal year 2020') were both 52-week fiscal years.\n\nOn November 4, 2019, we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security business (the 'Symantec Business'). We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. See Note 13. 'Segment Information' for additional information.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The inputs into certain of these estimates and assumptions include the consideration of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of these estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.\n\nCash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our cash and cash equivalents at the time of purchase.\n\nTrade accounts receivable, net. Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information, among other factors. Allowances for doubtful accounts were not material as of October 30, 2022 or October 31, 2021. Accounts receivable are also recognized net of sales returns and distributor credit allowances. These amounts are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discounts will be granted or products will be returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021 were $126 million and $129 million, respectively.",

      "answer": "Broadcom's collaborative product development with OEMs, which has enabled the company to build its extensive IP portfolio and gain system-level knowledge (page_15), directly contributes to both strategic advantages and financial risks. However, this IP portfolio is also a source of litigation exposure, as Broadcom may be required to expend resources on non-infringing technology, enter cross-licenses that weaken its IP position, or pay substantial damages in the event of infringement claims (page_38). Furthermore, the company incurs amortization costs from acquisition-related intangible assets tied to its IP, which are recognized over their estimated useful lives and impact financial performance (page_62). This creates a complex dynamic where the same IP assets that provide competitive differentiation and customer insight also expose Broadcom to legal liabilities and recurring financial obligations.",

These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals, as well as stockholder derivative suits; civil or criminal fines and penalties; legal and other expenses; and expenses associated with the remedial measure, if any, which may be imposed.\n\n## Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this 'Risk Factors' section, these factors include, among others:\n\n- the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in enduser demand for our customers' the products;\n- fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers;\n- the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;\n- the timing of new software contracts and renewals, as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any pre-paid amounts under the contract;\n- our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies;\n- the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;\n- new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;\n- seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets;\n- timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies; and\n- timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, and tax reform.\n\nThe foregoing factors are often difficult to predict, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarterto-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.\n\n## Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements, which may not be accurate.",

Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers, and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer's organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers' requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. Many of our customers and their contract manufacturers often require time critical delivery of our products to multiple locations around the world. With sales offices located in various countries, our primary warehouse in Malaysia, and dedicated regional customer support call centers, where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other order fulfillment requirements, we believe we are well-positioned to support our customers throughout the design, technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies.\n\nOur software customers are in most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, government agencies, global IT service providers, telecommunication providers, transportation companies, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions. Our customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe-centric, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Manufacturing Operations\n\nWe focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model. Accordingly, we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. The majority of our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited ('TSMC'). We use third-party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, including Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. We use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes, such as our FBAR filters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity surface emitting laser and side emitting lasers-based on GaAs and InP lasers for fiber optic communications, while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard CMOS. By doing so, we can protect our IP and accelerate time to market for our products. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the U.S. and Singapore.\n\nWe also have a long history of operating in Asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials. We store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and our presence in Asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers' manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Manufacturing Materials and Suppliers\n\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials. We purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis. These purchases are generally on a purchase order basis and some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time and cost necessary for re-design or qualification. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of techniques, including redesigning products for alternative components, making incremental or 'lifetime' purchases, or qualifying more than one source of supply. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans, and to monitor our suppliers' financial health. Some suppliers may, nonetheless, extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique or highly specialized components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly, or at all.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries, as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, while others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system",

Business under 'Seasonality' of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDistributors and original equipment manufacturers ('OEMs'), or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer's organization.

This collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances.\n\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stock-based compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, inventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, and acquisition costs, which include direct transaction costs and acquisition-related costs.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with the acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges. Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, facility and lease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.",

Morgan and TD Securities, suggesting a shift in syndicate composition. In April 2022, BNP Paribas again participated, this time alongside Barclays, BBVA, and J.P. Morgan, showing both continuity in key partnerships and evolving combinations of dealer-managers. This pattern reflects a deliberate capital structure strategy that leverages a stable core of financial partners while adapting the syndicate based on deal size, timing, or market conditions.",
