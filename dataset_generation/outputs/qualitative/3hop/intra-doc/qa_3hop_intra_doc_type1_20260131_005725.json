      "question": "How does Microsoft's direct sales strategy for cloud services, as outlined in their distribution model, align with the integration of Nuance's cloud offerings into Azure revenue and the inclusion of Nuance professional services within the Intelligent Cloud segment?",
      "answer": "Microsoft directly sells cloud services through digital marketplaces and online stores, emphasizing their strategic focus on cloud as a key growth area. Following the acquisition of Nuance, its cloud services are now included in Azure and other cloud services revenue, contributing to the growth metrics of Server products and cloud services. Furthermore, Nuance's professional services are integrated into the Intelligent Cloud segment under Enterprise Services, indicating a cohesive alignment between Microsoft's direct sales model, Nuance's offerings, and the broader cloud strategy. This integration supports Microsoft\u2019s ability to deliver comprehensive cloud solutions directly to customers while expanding the scope of services under the Intelligent Cloud segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "question": "Given the 22.2% year-over-year revenue growth in Server products and cloud services, how does Microsoft's competitive positioning of Windows Server within its Intelligent Cloud segment align with its strategic emphasis on Azure and cloud-first infrastructure?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's Server products and cloud services generated $97.7 billion in revenue for FY2024, representing a 22.2% increase from FY2023. Within this category, Windows Server is explicitly included as a foundational component of Microsoft's hybrid cloud offerings. The Intelligent Cloud segment description highlights Windows Server as part of an integrated stack that supports both on-premises and cloud environments, aligning with Microsoft's broader cloud-first strategy centered on Azure. However, while Windows Server remains a critical enterprise platform, the segment's growth is increasingly driven by Azure consumption-based services rather than traditional server licenses. This reflects a strategic shift where Windows Server serves as a bridge to cloud migration rather than a standalone product, supporting Microsoft's vision of hybrid IT environments powered by Azure infrastructure.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

      "answer": "Cisco offers financing arrangements, including loan receivables with average terms of one to three years, to support the sale of hardware and other offerings (page 82). These loan receivables are exposed to credit risk, which is reflected in the credit loss allowance. As of July 29, 2023, the allowance for credit losses allocated to loan receivables was $53 million, down from $103 million as of July 30, 2022, indicating a reduction in expected credit losses over the reporting period. This change in allowance must be viewed in context with the average loan term of one to three years, suggesting that the company's credit risk exposure from hardware financing is medium-term and has seen an improvement in credit quality or proactive loss mitigation over FY2023.",

      "question": "How does Intel's strategic decision to divest its NAND memory business to SK hynix, including the Fab Assets in Dalian, relate to its continued manufacturing and sale of NAND wafers using those same assets, and what does this imply about Intel's ongoing involvement in NAND production post-divestiture?",
      "answer": "Intel signed an agreement with SK hynix in October 2020 to divest its NAND memory business, including the Fab Assets in Dalian, China. The first closing of the transaction, completed on December 29, 2021, included the sale of the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business to SK hynix. Despite this divestiture, Intel entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, under which it continues to manufacture NAND memory wafers using the Dalian Fab Assets for SK hynix until the second closing. This implies that although Intel is exiting direct ownership of NAND manufacturing infrastructure, it maintains a transitional operational role in NAND production, supporting SK hynix\u2019s ramp-up while gradually reducing its own exposure to NAND manufacturing.",

NSG is disrupting the memory and storage hierarchy with new tiers that balance capacity, performance, and cost. Our products are available in innovative form factors and densities to address the memory and storage challenges our customers face in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience. Put simply, in today's data-driven world, advances in both data center and client computing need to be matched by cutting-edge innovation in the memoryand-storage space.\"\n\n-Rob Crooke, NSG General Manager\n\n## 5-Year Trends",

      "answer": "Accenture's strategy emphasizes being a 'reinvention partner of choice' by delivering 360\u00b0 value through AI, data, and transformational technology services. However, the company faces a structural financial risk due to the nature of its client contracts, many of which are terminable on short notice with little or no penalties. This limits the enforceability of performance obligations and affects revenue predictability. Specifically, only the non-cancelable portion of contracts is included in remaining performance obligations, meaning a large portion of contract bookings is not guaranteed. This creates a tension between Accenture's strategic positioning as a long-term transformation partner and the operational reality of contract instability, which could undermine revenue forecasts and client retention metrics.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's investment in Azure, as noted in the operating expenses section, align with the growth trajectory of the Server products and cloud services segment, which includes Azure, given the 22% year-over-year revenue increase in that segment?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's Server products and cloud services segment, which includes Azure, saw a revenue increase from $79,970 million in 2023 to $97,726 million in 2024, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. This growth is attributed in part to Azure's expansion, driven by consumption-based services and AI infrastructure scaling. In response to this growth, Microsoft increased its investments in Azure, as noted in the operating expenses section, where expenses were driven by 'investments in Azure' despite a slight overall decrease in operating expenses. This indicates a strategic reallocation of resources to capitalize on Azure's growth potential and strengthen its market position in cloud and AI services.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system.

      "question": "Given Apple's significant net sales of $74.2 billion from the Greater China region in 2022, how does the company's reliance on China Mainland within this region for manufacturing and supply chain operations expose it to risk, particularly in light of the geopolitical and public health challenges described in the risk factors section?",
      "answer": "Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from the Greater China region in 2022, which includes China Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This region is not only a major revenue contributor but also a critical part of Apple's global supply chain. However, the company's operations are exposed to significant risks due to its reliance on China Mainland for manufacturing and logistics. As noted in the risk factors section, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China have led to tariffs that increase the cost of Apple's products and components, potentially reducing gross margins and consumer demand. Additionally, public health issues like the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can disrupt supply chains, delay product delivery, and affect consumer confidence and spending. These combined factors illustrate how Apple's strategic and operational exposure to the Greater China region, particularly China Mainland, presents both opportunity and risk.",

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm has $12.8 billion in total purchase obligations, primarily for integrated circuit products, with $3.0 billion in advance payments to suppliers recorded as assets as of September 29, 2024. However, Samsung, one of Qualcomm\u2019s largest customers and a key player in the semiconductor space, is also a competitor that develops and uses its own integrated circuit products in its devices rather than Qualcomm\u2019s. This vertical integration by Samsung could reduce Qualcomm\u2019s revenue from one of its major customers, which is particularly concerning given Qualcomm\u2019s significant financial commitments to suppliers. If Samsung continues to displace Qualcomm\u2019s products, Qualcomm may face challenges in meeting its minimum purchase commitments, potentially leading to financial losses on advance payments and reduced cash flow. This dynamic highlights a strategic and financial risk where Qualcomm\u2019s supplier obligations are growing at the same time that major customers are becoming direct competitors.",

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was nine years and eight years, respectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $184 million, $204 million and $207 million, respectively. At September 29, 2024, other assets included $719 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $708 million recorded in other liabilities. At September 24, 2023, other assets included $612 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $571 million recorded in other liabilities.\n\nAt September 29, 2024, future lease payments under our operating leases were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices.

Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Mobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors' integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless networks, which may enable such competitors to better optimize their integrated circuit products for performance on those networks; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions.\n\nIn addition, certain of our largest customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers, such as Apple and Samsung, have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize or may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers; limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us; or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows, and/or enabling critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development, and commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nCompetition in any or all product areas or device tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees' products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n\n## Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are ex acerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices, including motor vehicles or motor vehicle systems. We routinely monitor for and assess security vulnerabilities in our products and offer remediation measures if appropriate. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or provide remediation measures for vulnerabilities (or our customers may fail to implement remediation measures) before they are exploited.\n\nOur products may be used in devices that interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content, which creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers' products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers' products or IT infrastructure.

      "answer": "Intel's strategic rationale for entering into the NAND wafer manufacturing agreement with SK hynix was to maintain continuity in NAND wafer production while transitioning ownership of the NAND business. This agreement was structured as part of a two-stage divestiture initiated in October 2020 and finalized in 2022, with the first closing in December 2021 involving the sale of the NAND SSD Business and the Dalian fabrication facility. The agreement ensured that Intel could continue manufacturing NAND wafers using the Dalian facility until the second closing, allowing SK hynix to ramp up operations while Intel phased out its involvement. This transitional manufacturing arrangement reflects Intel's strategic goal of exiting the NAND memory business while maintaining short-term supply chain stability for both parties.",

NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience. Put simply, in today's data-driven world, advances in both data center and client computing need to be matched by cutting-edge innovation in the memoryand-storage space.\"\n\n-Rob Crooke, NSG General Manager\n\n## 5-Year Trends",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's exposure to revenue volatility from licensee disputes over royalty payments reconcile with their accounting policy that requires revenue recognition based on estimated royalty payments even before final agreement terms are settled?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm faces significant challenges from licensees who dispute, underreport, or delay royalty payments, which can delay revenue recognition until agreements are finalized (page 27). Despite this operational and legal risk, Qualcomm's accounting policy on page 69 states that they recognize royalty revenues based on estimates derived from preliminary licensee reports and market data, even before final reports are submitted. This creates a tension where the company must recognize revenue under uncertain conditions, potentially leading to future adjustments and volatility. The binding arbitration provisions in license agreements further complicate this dynamic, as unresolved disputes can delay final terms and thus definitive revenue recognition. The synthesis of these two perspectives reveals a business model that is both exposed to execution risk and reliant on forward-looking revenue estimation techniques that may not fully capture the downstream impact of licensee behavior.",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nLicense agreements contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that ex ists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated.\n\nLicensees pay per-unit royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and, to a lesser ex tent, lump sum payments (license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). License fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licenseeby-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is ex ecuted and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement. If all such conditions are not met, revenues and any associated receivables are generally not recognized until such time that the required conditions are met. Cash collected from customers prior to a contract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting, underpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items, evaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees' conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other items, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are newly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues have been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and enforceable right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\n\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\n\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable, net (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied",

      "question": "How does Broadcom's valuation methodology for developed technology related to SoC controller products compare with its treatment of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) developed technology, and what does this reveal about the strategic importance of VCF within Broadcom's post-acquisition asset portfolio?",
      "answer": "Broadcom applies different valuation methodologies to developed technology depending on its application: the relief-from-royalty method is used for SoC controller products (valued based on forecasted revenue and royalty rates), while the multi-period excess earnings method is used for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) developed technology (valued based on projected cash flows, technology obsolescence rate, and contributory asset charges). The significant allocation of $24,156 million to VCF-related developed technology out of the $45,572 million in total acquired intangibles from the VMware acquisition underscores the strategic emphasis on VCF as a core asset. This contrast in valuation approach and the substantial investment in VCF-related intangibles suggest that Broadcom views VCF as a critical growth driver requiring a more complex and forward-looking earnings model compared to the more established SoC controller technology.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was 18%, a decrease from 19% in fiscal year 2023, primarily due to tax benefits from law changes including Notice 2023-80, which indefinitely delayed the effective date of the final foreign tax credit regulations. This delay allowed Microsoft to continue benefiting from lower foreign tax rates, particularly from its Irish regional operating center, which generated 83% of its foreign income before tax in fiscal year 2024. The geographic distribution of income\u2014$44.9 billion from foreign jurisdictions\u2014enabled Microsoft to maintain a lower effective tax rate compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate, illustrating how regulatory deferrals align with its international tax planning strategy.",

The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

      "answer": "Microsoft positions Enterprise Support Services as a core enabler for customers deploying and managing its cloud and on-premises solutions, including Azure and Nuance offerings (page 11). This service is explicitly included under the broader 'Enterprise and partner services' category (page 10), which is a revenue line item reported at $7,594 million in 2024 (page 93). Despite the company's strategic emphasis on enterprise services as a differentiator, the data shows a decline in this revenue stream year-over-year.

      "answer": "AMD highlights the Versal FPGAs as key products for hyperscale data centers, particularly in enabling AI workloads and being integrated into servers and appliances for major cloud service providers (page 11). However, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) now restrict the export of certain Versal FPGAs to China or entities with ultimate parents in Country Groups D1, D4, or D5 without a license or a 25-day NAC notification (page 32). These restrictions could result in shipment delays or outright prohibitions, directly affecting AMD\u2019s ability to serve a major international market. Given that international revenue constitutes a significant portion of AMD\u2019s business and that forecasting shipments has become more uncertain due to the unpredictability of license approvals, these export controls could materially impact AMD\u2019s revenue forecasts and competitive positioning, especially if competitors face less stringent restrictions.",

Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "answer": "AMD is subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that restrict the export of certain AMD Versal\u2122 FPGAs to China and other D5 countries without a license, and require a Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification 25 days prior to shipment. These controls can result in BIS prohibiting shipments or imposing burdensome licensing conditions. Meanwhile, AMD positions FPGAs as a core component of its hyperscale data center strategy, where they are used in servers and custom hardware for AI workloads, including generative AI models. The strategic emphasis on FPGAs for global hyperscale deployment conflicts with the growing regulatory constraints that limit access to key international markets, particularly China, which could hinder AMD\u2019s ability to scale this business segment and maintain competitive positioning in the AI-driven data center space.",

Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's tax benefit from the delay of the final foreign tax credit regulations under Notice 2023-55 reconcile with the geographic distribution of its foreign income, particularly from Ireland, and the overall effective tax rate reduction in fiscal year 2024?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was 18%, down from 19% in fiscal year 2023, primarily due to tax benefits from law changes, including the delay of the final foreign tax credit regulations through Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80. The delay allowed Microsoft to defer the impact of more stringent foreign tax credit limitations, preserving tax benefits from its foreign operations. Notably, 83% of Microsoft\u2019s foreign income before tax in fiscal year 2024 was generated from its Irish regional operating center, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate. This geographic income distribution significantly contributed to lowering the effective tax rate, and the regulatory delay provided additional flexibility to manage foreign tax credits under U.S. tax law, reinforcing the benefit from this international structure.",

        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_82) \u2192 [Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations]: Microsoft complies with and is affected by the timing of these regulations, which impact its foreign tax credit utilization and effective tax rate.",

        "Hop 3: [Notice 2023-55] \u2190 [MSFT](page_47): The delay of the regulations is explicitly cited in the Income Taxes section as a key factor in the 1% reduction of Microsoft\u2019s effective tax rate from 19% to 18% in fiscal year 2024."

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## Effective Tax Rate\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectiv ely. The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's ongoing use of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company as trustee in multiple supplemental indentures relate to the foundational terms established in the Base Indenture from 2009, and what does this imply about the continuity and structure of Microsoft's long-term debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Microsoft has consistently used The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company (BNY Mellon) as trustee across multiple supplemental indentures for various debt issuances, including the 1.625% Notes due 2018, 3.625% Notes due 2023, and 4.875% Notes due 2043 (dated December 6, 2013), and earlier issuances such as the 2.95% Notes due 2014 (dated May 18, 2009). These supplemental indentures are all governed by the Base Indenture dated May 18, 2009. This continuity implies that Microsoft has maintained a consistent legal and structural framework for its long-term debt obligations, leveraging the Base Indenture as a foundational document to efficiently issue new debt instruments over time while preserving standardized terms and oversight through a trusted trustee relationship.",

      "question": "How does AMD's strategy of retiring the 7.50% Senior Notes compare with the conversion dynamics of the 2.125% Notes, particularly in light of the significant excess of the if-converted value over principal for the latter?",
      "answer": "AMD has the option to retire the 7.50% Senior Notes through redemption or repurchase, with specific contractual provisions allowing for a 'make whole' premium prior to maturity, and a repurchase right for holders in the event of a change of control. Meanwhile, the 2.125% Notes, which are convertible into shares of common stock, had an if-converted value exceeding their principal by $15 million as of December 23, 2021, creating potential equity dilution upon conversion. The Company\u2019s strategy of repurchasing or retiring both note classes is influenced by market conditions and financial flexibility, but the 2.125% Notes present a dual risk of both cash outflow and dilution, unlike the fixed principal and interest structure of the 7.50% Notes. This dynamic suggests AMD may prioritize retiring the 2.125% Notes through equity settlement to avoid cash outflows, while managing the 7.50% Notes through scheduled redemption or refinancing.",

The 2.125% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The interest  is  payable  semi-annually  in  March  and  September  of  each  year,  commencing in March 2017. During 2021, holders of the 2.125% Notes converted $25 million principal amount of notes in exchange for approximately 3 million shares of the Company's common stock at the conversion price of $8.00 per share. The Company recorded a loss of $7 million from these conversions in Other income (expense), net on its consolidated statements of operations. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2.125% Notes was $1 million.\n\nThe Company's current intent is to deliver shares of its common stock upon conversion of the 2.125% Notes. As such, no sinking  fund  is  provided  for  the  2.125%  Notes  and  the  Company  continued  to  classify  the  carrying  value  of  the liability  component  of  the  2.125%  Notes  as  long-term  debt  and  the  equity  component  of  the  2.125%  Notes  as permanent equity on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2021. The determination of whether or not the 2.125% Notes are convertible is performed on a calendar-quarter basis.\n\nBased on the closing price of the Company's common stock of $146.14 on December 23, 2021, the last trading day of 2021, the if-converted value of the 2.125% Notes exceeded its principal amount by approximately $15 million.\n\nThe effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes is 8%. This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated conversion features.\n\nThe  following  table  sets  forth  total  interest  expense  recognized  related  to  the  2.125%  Notes  for  the  year  ended December 25, 2021:\n\n",

The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes was $312 million.\n\nPrior to August 15, 2022, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a 'make whole' premium (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture). Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.50% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the 7.50% Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.50% Notes.\n\n## Debt Covenants and Seniority\n\nThe  7.50%  Notes  require  the  Company  to  comply  with  certain  financial  covenants  and  a  number  of  restrictive covenants. The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank equally with the Company's existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of the Company's future subordinated debt. The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank junior to all of the  Company's  future  senior  secured  debt  to  the  extent  of  the  collateral  securing  such  debt  and  are  structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes\n\nThe Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nThe Company is party to a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), including a $50 million swingline sub-facility and a $75 million sublimit for letters of credit pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in June 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the base rate at the Company's option (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. As of December 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had $14 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n## Future Payments on Total Debt\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, the Company's future debt payment obligations were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022\n\nOn August 15, 2012, the Company issued $500 million of its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes). The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes was $312 million.\n\nPrior to August 15, 2022, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a 'make whole' premium (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture). Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.50% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the 7.50% Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.50% Notes.\n\n## Debt Covenants and Seniority\n\nThe  7.50%  Notes  require  the  Company  to  comply  with  certain  financial  covenants  and  a  number  of  restrictive covenants. The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank equally with the Company's existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of the Company's future subordinated debt. The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank junior to all of the  Company's  future  senior  secured  debt  to  the  extent  of  the  collateral  securing  such  debt  and  are  structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes\n\nThe Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nThe Company is party to a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), including a $50 million swingline sub-facility and a $75 million sublimit for letters of credit pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in June 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the base rate at the Company's option (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. As of December 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had $14 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n## Future Payments on Total Debt\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, the Company's future debt payment obligations were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's exclusion of Activision Blizzard's internal controls from its assessment of financial reporting controls relate to the issuance of the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, and what implications does this have given Microsoft's role in the indenture agreement for those notes?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's internal control assessment explicitly excluded Activision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and represented less than 1% of Microsoft\u2019s total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles) and 2% of total revenues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Despite this exclusion, Activision Blizzard issued the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 under an indenture dated September 19, 2016, which Microsoft assumed responsibility for following the acquisition. Microsoft further amended this indenture on November 6, 2023, indicating active involvement in the governance and financial obligations of Activision Blizzard post-acquisition. This raises the question of how Microsoft ensures the integrity of financial commitments like the Senior Notes when the internal controls of the issuing entity were not included in its broader financial control evaluation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_98) \u2192 [Activision Blizzard, Inc.]: Microsoft excluded Activision Blizzard\u2019s internal controls from its financial reporting controls assessment, noting the company represented less than 1% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles) and 2% of total revenues.",
        "Hop 2: [Activision Blizzard, Inc.] \u2192 [3.400% Senior Notes due 2026]: Activision Blizzard issued the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 under an indenture dated September 19, 2016, which was later amended on October 27, 2023, by Microsoft post-acquisition.",
        "Hop 3: [3.400% Senior Notes due 2026] \u2190 [MSFT](page_106): Microsoft filed the indenture agreement for the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 as part of its Exhibit 4.19 on November 6, 2023, indicating its legal and financial responsibility for the notes post-acquisition."

      "question": "How does Microsoft's repeated use of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company as a trustee across multiple debt issuances, including the 5.20% Notes due 2039, reflect on the strategic and legal structuring of its long-term debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Microsoft has consistently used The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (BNY Mellon) as a trustee for multiple debt issuances, including the 5.20% Notes due 2039, as evidenced by the repeated appearance of BNY Mellon in supplemental indentures across various note maturities and interest rates (e.g., 1.625% Notes due 2018, 3.500% Notes due 2035, and 4.750% Notes due 2055). This pattern indicates a strategic and long-standing legal relationship with BNY Mellon, which likely provides consistency and efficiency in the structuring of Microsoft\u2019s debt instruments. The 5.20% Notes due 2039 are specifically governed under the First Supplemental Indenture dated May 18, 2009, which is part of a broader Base Indenture with BNY Mellon. This repeated use of the same trustee across decades of debt issuances suggests that Microsoft values continuity in legal oversight and administrative execution, particularly for long-dated obligations like the 2039 notes, which carry a higher coupon rate compared to shorter-term instruments. This implies a deliberate legal and financial structuring approach to manage long-term liabilities with trusted counterparties.",

      "answer": "Microsoft issued the 3.00% Notes due 2020 under a Second Supplemental Indenture dated September 27, 2010, with BNY Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, indicating a long-standing role for BNY Mellon in Microsoft\u2019s debt structuring. This relationship continued through subsequent issuances, such as the 2.000% Notes due 2020 under a Tenth Supplemental Indenture dated November 3, 2015, also governed by the same base indenture with BNY Mellon. However, later issuances, including the 2.400% Notes due 2026 under an Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, were administered by U.S. Bank National Association, suggesting a shift in trustee responsibilities over time while maintaining the foundational indenture framework established with BNY Mellon.",

      "answer": "Microsoft issued the 1.625% Notes due 2015 under a Second Supplemental Indenture dated September 27, 2010, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company serving as trustee. This relationship continued as evidenced by later supplemental indentures, such as the Eighth Supplemental Indenture dated December 6, 2013, which also named BNY Mellon Trust Company as trustee for other note series, including the 1.625% Notes due 2018. The consistent use of BNY Mellon as trustee across multiple note issuances indicates a sustained and trusted financial partnership, suggesting that Microsoft relies on BNY Mellon\u2019s institutional credibility and expertise in managing complex debt instruments over time.",

      "answer": "The $7 credit loss provision benefit for loan receivables in fiscal 2023 indicates that Cisco recovered more than it reserved for loan defaults during the year. This relates to Cisco's financing arrangements for Advanced Services, as loan receivables are explicitly tied to the sale of services including Advanced Services. The positive net recovery suggests that the credit risk associated with financing extended for Advanced Services was lower than anticipated, potentially indicating strong customer creditworthiness or effective risk management in financing decisions for service contracts.",

      "question": "How does Apple's characterization of supply chain risks associated with Taiwan reconcile with the financial performance of its Greater China segment, which includes Taiwan?",
      "answer": "Apple highlights in its risk factors on page 9 that its supply chain is vulnerable to disruptions in regions like Taiwan, where a portion of its manufacturing is outsourced. The company acknowledges that any business interruption in these areas could significantly impact its operations and profitability. Meanwhile, page 25 clarifies that Taiwan is included within the Greater China segment. Financial data from page 52 shows that the Greater China segment reported $74.2 billion in net sales and $31.153 billion in operating income in 2022, indicating strong performance despite the acknowledged risks. This juxtaposition suggests that while Apple recognizes Taiwan as a critical and potentially volatile node in its supply chain, the broader Greater China segment remains a significant contributor to the company\u2019s financial results.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' References to 'and,' 'or' and 'and/or' should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies - Concentrations.'\n\nIn addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand, elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles.

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance.

Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.

      "question": "How does Microsoft's treatment of Software Assurance (SA) in revenue recognition judgments relate to its inclusion of SA in Enterprise Agreements, particularly given the three-year licensing period specified for those agreements?",
      "answer": "Microsoft applies significant judgment in determining the standalone selling price (SSP) for products not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with Software Assurance (SA), as outlined in the revenue recognition policies on page 64. SA is embedded within Enterprise Agreements, which are structured for medium or large organizations to license cloud services and on-premises software over a three-year period, as described on page 19. The three-year horizon of Enterprise Agreements aligns with the complexity of assessing the pattern of delivery and exercise of SA benefits across customer portfolios, reinforcing the need for judgment in estimating SSP and recognizing revenue over time. This interplay highlights how the contractual structure of SA within multi-year licensing programs influences Microsoft's revenue recognition methodology and timing.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

      "question": "How does Apple's characterization of Taiwan as a supply chain risk factor reconcile with the financial performance of the Greater China segment, which includes Taiwan, showing a 14% increase in operating income from 2021 to 2022?",
      "answer": "Apple identifies Taiwan as a key part of its supply chain, located in a region prone to geopolitical and operational risks, including trade tensions and natural disasters. Despite these concerns, the Greater China segment, which includes Taiwan, reported a rise in operating income from $28,504 million in 2021 to $31,153 million in 2022\u2014a 14% increase. This suggests that while Apple acknowledges the vulnerability of its operations in the region, the segment continues to contribute significantly to the company's profitability. The financial performance indicates resilience or effective risk mitigation strategies in place, even as the company remains exposed to potential disruptions in Taiwan and the broader Greater China region.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's issuance of the 0.875% Notes due 2013, administered through BNY Mellon, relate to the subsequent multi-year debt instruments issued with BNY Mellon as trustee, and what does this imply about Microsoft's long-term debt structuring strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft issued the 0.875% Notes due 2013 under a Second Supplemental Indenture dated September 27, 2010, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as trustee (page 103). This establishes a formal financial relationship with BNY Mellon in the administration of Microsoft's debt instruments. Further evidence from page 105 shows that Microsoft continued to work with BNY Mellon (and later U.S. Bank) as trustee in subsequent years, issuing multiple supplemental indentures for notes with maturities extending as far as 2056. The repeated use of BNY Mellon as trustee across multiple debt issuances suggests a strategic, long-standing partnership in structuring Microsoft's long-term debt obligations, indicating a consistent and deliberate approach to capital market engagement and liability management.",

        "Hop 2: [0.875% Notes due 2013] \u2192 [BNY Mellon]: BNY Mellon served as trustee for this issuance, indicating a regulatory and administrative role in Microsoft's debt structure.",

      "question": "How does AMD's binding wafer purchase target commitment with GLOBALFOUNDRIES through 2025 reconcile with their lack of long-term commitment contracts with other third-party manufacturing suppliers, and what financial risk does this create if actual wafer requirements fall short of purchase targets?",
      "answer": "AMD has a binding wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. through 2025, which includes minimum annual capacity allocation from GF and corresponding annual wafer purchase targets from AMD. If AMD fails to meet these targets, it must pay GF a portion of the difference. This contrasts with AMD's general lack of long-term commitment contracts with other third-party suppliers, where services are often obtained on a purchase order basis without guaranteed capacity. This creates a unique financial exposure specific to GF, as AMD could face excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs if actual wafer requirements fall short of purchase targets, unlike with other suppliers where AMD could more freely adjust procurement volumes.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's revenue recognition policy for sales-based royalties from licensees, as outlined in the accounting policy section, interact with the risk of delayed or non-payment by certain licensees, particularly Chinese OEMs, and how might this affect the company's reliance on a limited number of major licensees for a significant portion of its licensing revenues?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm recognizes sales-based royalties using estimates based on preliminary licensee reports and market data, which are adjusted in subsequent periods as actual data becomes available (page 69). However, some licensees, particularly Chinese OEMs, have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements, and others have underreported or not paid royalties owed (page 27). Since Qualcomm derives a significant portion of its licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, including several Chinese OEMs (page 19), any failure by these key licensees to meet reporting and payment obligations\u2014whether due to disputes, underreporting, or non-payment\u2014could materially impact Qualcomm\u2019s revenues and cash flows. This creates a risk where the company's accounting policy relies on timely and accurate reporting, but operational realities show that certain licensees may not comply, thereby threatening a core revenue stream.",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nLicense agreements contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that ex ists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated.\n\nLicensees pay per-unit royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and, to a lesser ex tent, lump sum payments (license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). License fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licenseeby-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is ex ecuted and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement. If all such conditions are not met, revenues and any associated receivables are generally not recognized until such time that the required conditions are met. Cash collected from customers prior to a contract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting, underpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items, evaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees' conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other items, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are newly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues have been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and enforceable right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\n\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\n\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable, net (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

      "answer": "Cisco had $10.9 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 27, 2024, which is part of its broader short-term debt financing program. In February 2024, the company issued $13.5 billion in senior fixed-rate notes, which rank at par with the commercial paper notes. This indicates that both instruments are similarly prioritized in the capital structure, though the senior notes are longer-term in nature. Additionally, Cisco entered into an interest rate swap for $0.5 billion of the senior fixed-rate notes, converting fixed interest payments to floating rates based on SOFR, which suggests an active hedging strategy to manage interest rate exposure. Despite these liabilities, Cisco remained in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 27, 2024, demonstrating disciplined debt management even with significant short- and long-term obligations.",

      "question": "How does Apple's financial performance in the Greater China segment, which includes Taiwan, relate to its operational risk disclosures concerning business interruptions in Taiwan, particularly in the context of global supply chain dependencies?",
      "answer": "Apple's financial performance in the Greater China segment in 2022 shows $74.2 billion in net sales and $31.153 billion in operating income, indicating the region's significant contribution to the company's revenue. This segment includes Taiwan, a key geographic component as defined in the segment operating performance section. However, in the risk factors section, Apple highlights that its operations, including those in Taiwan, are vulnerable to business interruptions such as natural disasters, pandemics (e.g., the ongoing uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic), and geopolitical tensions. Given that Apple outsources a substantial portion of its manufacturing to Asia, including Taiwan, any disruption in this region could materially impact its global supply chain and profitability. Therefore, while Taiwan contributes to Apple's financial success within the Greater China segment, it also represents a critical operational risk due to its role in manufacturing and supply chain dependencies.",

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "answer": "Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from the Greater China region in 2022, which includes Taiwan as part of its geographic segment. However, the company also discloses in its risk factors that a significant portion of its supply chain and manufacturing operations are located in Asia, including Taiwan, and are vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, public health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic, and other business interruptions.

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful.

In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons.

Risk Factors\n\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' References to 'and,' 'or' and 'and/or' should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies - Concentrations.'\n\nIn addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand, elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), or a shift in share away",

      "answer": "Microsoft's balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, reflects only $1 million in convertible senior notes remaining from the $986 million originally issued by Nuance, indicating that nearly all of these obligations were redeemed prior to the reporting date. This financial simplification aligns with Microsoft's broader strategic integration of Nuance into its Intelligent Cloud segment, where the acquired company's operations have been embedded into Microsoft's cloud offerings, including Azure and professional services. The minimal remaining liability from Nuance's pre-acquisition debt structure supports the company's narrative of operational consolidation and synergy realization, key justifications cited for the acquisition and now reflected both financially and structurally within the Intelligent Cloud segment.",

Our competitors continue to develop and deploy cloud-based serv ices for consumers and business customers, and pricing and deliv ery models are ev olv ing. We and our competitors are dev oting significant resources to dev elop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.\n- We are inv esting in artificial intelligence ('AI') across the entire company and infusing generativ e AI capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and serv ices to be a highly competitiv e and rapidly ev olv ing market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will bear significant dev elopment and operational costs to build and support the AI models, serv ices, platforms, and infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectiv ely we must also be responsiv e to technological change, new and potential regulatory dev elopments, and public scrutiny.\n- Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-serv ice business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software rev enue. We bear the costs of conv erting original ideas into software products through inv estments in research and dev elopment, offsetting these costs with the rev enue receiv ed from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also dev elop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n- Other competitors dev elop and offer free applications, online serv ices, and content, and make money by selling third-party adv ertising. Advertising rev enue funds dev elopment of products and serv ices these competitors prov ide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our rev enue-generating products.\n- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source AI models, and earning rev enue on adv ertising or integrated products and serv ices. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitiv e pressures described abov e may cause decreased sales v olumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and dev elopment, marketing, and sales incentiv es, which may adv ersely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing and AI serv ices. These costs will reduce the operating margins. Whether we succeed in cloud-based and AI serv ices depends on our execution in sev eral areas, including:\n\n- Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and AI experiences and products that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n- Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and AI serv ices on the growing array of computing dev ices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other dev ices.\n- Continuing to enhance the attractiv eness of our cloud platforms to third-party dev elopers.\n- Ensuring our cloud-based serv ices meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n- Making our suite of cloud-based serv ices platform-agnostic, av ailable on a wide range of dev ices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will continue to attract users or generate the rev enue required to succeed.

      "question": "How does Intel's characterization of Samsung as both a key competitor in the foundry services market and a strategic partner elsewhere in the filing reflect the complexities of executing the IDM 2.0 strategy, particularly in light of the R&D delays and competitive pressures mentioned in the risk factors?",
      "answer": "Intel's 10-K outlines that IFS, as part of the IDM 2.0 strategy, faces significant competition from established players like Samsung and TSMC, particularly in areas such as manufacturing technology availability, process performance, and ecosystem support. The document highlights that delays in Intel's own manufacturing process technologies, such as the Intel 4 (formerly 7nm) node, have caused cost and time-to-market disadvantages relative to competing foundry processes. Despite this competitive dynamic, Intel also references a strategic partnership with Samsung (on page 95), suggesting that collaboration may be necessary to advance certain technologies or manufacturing capabilities. This dual relationship\u2014competing in the foundry space while partnering in other areas\u2014reflects the nuanced and complex nature of the IDM 2.0 strategy, where Intel must both innovate internally and engage with external partners to remain competitive, even among those who are also market rivals. The risk of not realizing a return on R&D investments is heightened in this environment, where delays can lead to both competitive disadvantage and increased reliance on strategic collaborations.",

For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n\nWe invest significantly in R&amp;D, and to the extent our R&amp;D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases.

      "answer": "Microsoft initially established the Base Indenture on May 18, 2009 (Exhibit 4.1 on page 103), naming The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as trustee. This foundational agreement governed multiple debt issuances, including the 1.625% Notes due 2015 referenced in Exhibit 4.5 on the same page. Subsequent supplemental indentures on page 105 (e.g., Exhibits 4.11\u20134.14) show Microsoft expanding its debt structure over time, with U.S. Bank National Association increasingly serving as trustee, starting with the Ninth Supplemental Indenture in February 2015. This shift indicates a strategic diversification of trustee relationships to manage growing and varied debt instruments, while maintaining continuity through the original Base Indenture framework. The use of multiple trustees supports Microsoft's ability to scale its debt financing operations while preserving institutional consistency and legal clarity.",

        "Hop 2: [BNY Mellon] \u2192 [1.625% Notes due 2015]: The 1.625% Notes due 2015 were specifically governed by the Second Supplemental Indenture (Exhibit 4.5) under the Base Indenture, with BNY Mellon as trustee, indicating the structured relationship between the debt instrument and the trustee.",
        "Hop 3: [1.625% Notes due 2015] \u2190 [MSFT](page_103): The Base Indenture and subsequent supplements on page 103 show Microsoft's long-standing use of BNY Mellon for debt issuance, but also reveal a shift toward U.S. Bank National Association for newer instruments, suggesting an evolution in Microsoft's debt management approach."

      "question": "How does Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which represented less than 1% of total assets post-goodwill exclusion, interact with Microsoft's existing financial partnerships with Wells Fargo Bank, given that Activision has multiple debt obligations administered by Wells Fargo?",
      "answer": "Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard on October 13, 2023, which represented less than 1% of Microsoft\u2019s total assets post-goodwill exclusion and 2% of total revenues as of June 30, 2024. Despite Microsoft\u2019s internal control assessment excluding Activision\u2019s internal controls, Activision maintains several debt instruments with Wells Fargo Bank, including senior notes due in 2027, 2030, 2047, and 2050. Microsoft itself has a long-standing relationship with Wells Fargo Bank as a trustee for certain debt instruments, though its primary trustee relationships are with other banks. This layered financial structure implies that Microsoft now inherits the financial obligations and administrative relationships tied to Activision\u2019s debt, even though these are managed through a third-party trustee that Microsoft also engages with for its own financial arrangements.",

      "answer": "Microsoft issued the 5.20% Notes due 2039 under a First Supplemental Indenture dated May 18, 2009, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. serving as trustee. This establishes a regulatory and administrative relationship where BNY Mellon oversees the terms and compliance of these long-term notes. In contrast, Microsoft's broader partnership with BNY Mellon, as evidenced by the subsequent supplemental indentures on page 105, includes managing a range of debt instruments with varying maturities (e.g., 1.625% Notes due 2018, 3.625% Notes due 2023, and 4.875% Notes due 2043) under a consistent trust framework. This demonstrates that BNY Mellon plays a recurring and trusted role in Microsoft\u2019s capital structure, facilitating multiple debt issuances over time beyond just the 2039 notes.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm highlights its extensive patent portfolio in Taiwan as part of its global intellectual property strategy, noting that a substantial portion of its patents and applications relate to foundational wireless technologies, including 5G, and that its patents have broad coverage in many countries, including Taiwan. However, the company also explicitly discloses that its business depends on receiving consistent and reliable chipset supply from foundry partners, particularly in Taiwan, and that a significant or prolonged military or geopolitical conflict involving China and Taiwan could severely limit or prevent it from receiving chipset supply, which would have a material adverse impact on its business. This juxtaposition reveals a strategic vulnerability: while Taiwan is critical to Qualcomm\u2019s global IP footprint, its manufacturing reliance on the region exposes it to significant operational risk, particularly given the geopolitical instability involving China and Taiwan.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's reliance on OEMs for Office distribution align with its competitive challenges from Meta in both productivity software and gaming markets, given Meta's direct-to-consumer platform advantages?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's OEM distribution model for Office, where the software is pre-installed by major manufacturers like Dell and HP on new devices, ensures broad market penetration and integration with hardware (page 18). However, this model contrasts with Meta's direct-to-consumer platform approach, which allows Meta to rapidly innovate and deploy software experiences without dependency on hardware partners. The filing explicitly lists Meta as a competitor to Office, indicating pressure in the productivity and collaboration space from Meta\u2019s web-based tools (page 12). Furthermore, Microsoft notes that its Xbox and cloud gaming services also face competition from Meta (page 16), suggesting that Meta\u2019s platform agility and direct user access pose a dual threat across both enterprise software and consumer gaming. This raises strategic questions about whether Microsoft\u2019s OEM-dependent distribution for Office can keep pace with Meta\u2019s integrated digital ecosystem in both markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming  services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "question": "Given Samsung's dual role as both a major customer representing over 10% of Qualcomm's fiscal 2022 revenues and a competitor developing its own integrated circuit products, how might this dynamic influence Qualcomm's R&D investment strategy in next-generation mobile technologies?",
      "answer": "Samsung's position as a top customer contributing over 10% of Qualcomm's fiscal 2022 revenues creates a significant dependency, but the company also faces the risk of Samsung developing and utilizing its own integrated circuit products in its devices, reducing Qualcomm's semiconductor sales. This dual role of Samsung as both a key customer and a vertical integrator poses a strategic challenge. In response, Qualcomm emphasizes continued investment in R&D, particularly in next-generation technologies like 5G, AI, and advanced SoC design, to maintain a competitive edge and retain relevance in the mobile ecosystem. The company's R&D focus includes developing chipsets on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple wireless technologies, aiming to offer superior value propositions that could dissuade Samsung from fully replacing Qualcomm's products.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.

In fiscal 2022, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies' and 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the use of 5G, the expansion into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in modem, radio-frequency integrated circuit, RFFE, multimedia (camera, video, display and computer vision), sensor perception and drive policy, advanced SoC, which includes specialized engines such as CPU and GPU to enable high performance and low-power computing and other optimization techniques, AI, packaging and a broad range of other technologies. We expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and technologies and to utilize that research and development in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of new modem and multimedia technologies and other technologies (such as ADAS/AD and XR), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world.\n\nWe continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhance existing products and services) for voice and data communications and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as ADAS/AD. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, voice and music devices, wearable devices and XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.\n\nWe develop innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.",

      "answer": "Cisco disclosed on page 53 that a 50 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of its $20.3 billion in senior fixed-rate notes by approximately $0.7 billion. This sensitivity applies to fixed-rate debt that is not hedged, and the company also noted that a sharp rise in interest rates could increase interest expense on new commercial paper issuances. On page 89, it is clarified that the senior fixed-rate notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes issued under Cisco's $15.0 billion short-term debt program. Page 88 introduces this commercial paper program, stating that proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The interplay between these instruments shows that while senior notes are subject to interest rate risk affecting fair value, commercial paper notes introduce direct interest expense volatility with market rate changes, impacting Cisco's short-term financing flexibility.",

      "answer": "The allowance for credit losses on loan receivables dropped from $103 million in fiscal 2022 to $53 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a reduced risk or a strategic shift in credit exposure. This decrease occurs despite loan receivables being tied to services like technical support, which are part of multi-year financing arrangements (1\u20133 years on average), suggesting either improved credit quality of counterparties or more conservative underwriting. The connection between loan receivables and technical support services implies that Cisco's financing risk is closely linked to the ongoing value and delivery of these services over the loan term.",

      "answer": "Broadcom valued the developed technology related to VMware Cloud Foundation using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, which reflects the present value of projected cash flows less charges representing the contribution of other assets. This was specifically applied to $24,156 million of developed technology, a significant portion of which was tied to VMware Cloud Foundation. In contrast, the developed technology for SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications was valued using the relief-from-royalty method, which applies a royalty rate to forecasted revenue. The difference in methodologies reveals that Broadcom views VMware-related developed technology as more closely tied to direct cash flows and core operations, while SoC controller technology is seen through the lens of licensing potential. This distinction underscores the strategic integration of VMware's cloud infrastructure as a core growth engine versus the more traditional, royalty-based monetization of storage controller IP.",

      "question": "How does Cisco's financing of technical support services relate to the $53 million credit loss allowance for loan receivables as of July 29, 2023, and what risk exposure does this represent given the $27.9 billion in channel partner financing from fiscal 2022?",
      "answer": "Cisco provides technical support services as part of its financing arrangements, which include loan receivables tied to the sale of hardware, software, and services (including technical support). These loan receivables are subject to credit risk, as evidenced by the $53 million allowance for credit losses on loan receivables as of July 29, 2023. This allowance reflects the company's estimate of potential defaults on these financing arrangements. Given that technical support services are embedded in loan packages, any credit risk associated with loan defaults indirectly affects the risk profile of services like technical support. Furthermore, in fiscal 2022, the volume of channel partner financing was $27.9 billion, with $1.7 billion of that amount subject to guarantees by Cisco as of July 29, 2023. This indicates that Cisco retains contingent liability exposure on financing arrangements that include technical support services, which could impact the credit loss allowance if defaults occur.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers.

      "answer": "Intel divested its NAND SSD Business and fabrication assets to SK hynix in a two-stage transaction starting in December 2021, yet continues to manufacture NAND wafers for SK hynix using the Dalian facility until the second closing. Despite exiting direct ownership of the NAND business, Intel still launched high-capacity SSDs like the Intel SSD D5-P5316 (up to 30.72TB) and the consumer-focused Intel SSD 670p (up to 2TB) in 2021, leveraging its 144-layer QLC NAND technology. This suggests that Intel's strategy shifted from owning the NAND manufacturing and SSD business to focusing on innovation in NAND-based solutions, while outsourcing the manufacturing and direct sales of NAND components. This allows Intel to remain competitive in NAND product integration without the capital burden of maintaining fabrication facilities.",

NSG is disrupting the memory and storage hierarchy with new tiers that balance capacity, performance, and cost. Our products are available in innovative form factors and densities to address the memory and storage challenges our customers face in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience. Put simply, in today's data-driven world, advances in both data center and client computing need to be matched by cutting-edge innovation in the memoryand-storage space.\"\n\n-Rob Crooke, NSG General Manager\n\n## 5-Year Trends",

      "answer": "Microsoft established the Base Indenture with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company in 2009 as a foundational framework for issuing debt instruments. Over time, Microsoft continued to utilize this structure by entering into multiple Supplemental Indentures with the same trustee, including issuances in 2010, 2013, and even through 2016, covering a range of maturities and interest rates (e.g., 0.875% Notes due 2013, 1.625% Notes due 2015, and 1.100% Notes due 2019).

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's financial exposure to integrated circuit product purchase obligations relate to its strategic risk of Samsung developing its own competing integrated circuit products, given Samsung's significance as a top 10%+ revenue contributor?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm faces a dual challenge where Samsung, a key customer contributing over 10% of consolidated revenues, is also developing its own integrated circuit products that directly compete with Qualcomm's offerings. This vertical integration by Samsung poses a strategic risk that could reduce Qualcomm's revenues and margins. At the same time, Qualcomm has significant financial exposure through multi-year capacity purchase commitments with suppliers of integrated circuit products, totaling $12.8 billion in obligations as of September 29, 2024, with $9.6 billion expected to be paid in the next 12 months. These obligations are difficult to cancel without incurring costs or forfeiting advance payments. Therefore, if Samsung shifts away from Qualcomm's integrated circuits, the company may face both declining revenues and inflexible cost structures tied to its manufacturing commitments, creating a compounded financial risk.",

        "Hop 2: [Samsung] \u2192 [Integrated Circuit Products]: Samsung is specifically called out as a major customer that develops its own integrated circuit products, which are used in its devices instead of Qualcomm\u2019s, creating a vertical integration risk.",

          "chunk_text": "products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases.

      "answer": "The 7.50% Senior Notes include specific redemption provisions that allow AMD to retire debt early with a 'make whole' premium, and they are subject to financial and restrictive covenants. This gives AMD flexibility in managing its older debt structure depending on market conditions. Meanwhile, the 2.125% Notes, which are convertible at the holder's option, have a fair value estimation that directly incorporates AMD's stock price of $146.14. Given the significant upside from the $8.00 conversion price, the embedded equity optionality likely plays a dominant role in the market valuation of these notes. Since both notes rank equally as senior obligations but differ in terms of redemption rights and equity-linked features, the 2.125% Notes' market value likely reflects both their debt characteristics and the substantial conversion premium, informed by AMD's strong equity performance.",

      "answer": "Microsoft identifies Meta as a growing competitor in the productivity software space, particularly in collaboration and communication tools (page 12). To counteract this competitive pressure, Microsoft leverages its OEM licensing strategy by pre-installing Office on new devices from major manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Lenovo (page 18). This ensures that Office remains the default productivity suite for a large portion of new device users, reinforcing user dependency and reducing the likelihood of switching to alternative platforms like those potentially offered by Meta. This OEM-driven distribution serves as a strategic defensive mechanism to preserve Microsoft's dominant position in the productivity software market, especially as Meta expands its offerings into enterprise collaboration tools.",

These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming  services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

The allowance for credit losses on loan receivables decreased from $103 million in FY2022 to $53 million in FY2023, indicating reduced credit risk.

      "answer": "Qualcomm faces a significant customer concentration risk, particularly in China, where U.S./China trade tensions could disrupt revenue streams. This risk is heightened because a large portion of its business is tied to premium tier handset sales in this region. At the same time, Qualcomm has identified 5G as a foundational technology for next-generation applications like XR (augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality), which are increasingly being integrated into consumer electronics, edge networking, and industrial applications. According to Qualcomm's revenue disclosures, XR is a key component of its IoT and consumer electronics segment, which is expected to grow alongside 5G adoption. However, if geopolitical risks in China disrupt Qualcomm's ability to deploy 5G technologies or sell into this market, it could hinder the company\u2019s ability to scale XR-related product lines and delay its strategic expansion into these emerging use cases.",

These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\n- We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n- Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n- A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\n- Our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n- We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\n\n- We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.\n- There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION\n\n- Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n- We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS\n\n- The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.\n- Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n- Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "answer": "Microsoft includes SA in Enterprise Agreements, which are structured as three-year licensing programs. Since SA is bundled with perpetual licenses in these agreements, it contributes to unearned revenue that is recognized ratably over the multi-year coverage period. However, due to the nature of SA benefits and the pattern of their delivery across the portfolio, Microsoft must apply judgment in estimating standalone selling prices (SSP) and recognizing revenue, especially when SA is not sold separately. This creates a nuanced revenue recognition profile where unearned revenue from SA-inclusive agreements is invoiced annually but recognized over time, depending on the estimated delivery pattern of SA benefits.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

      "answer": "Broadcom positions the Payment Security Suite (mentioned on page 13) as a SaaS-based payment authentication service aimed at helping banks and merchants protect against fraud and ensure a seamless online shopping experience. This offering is part of a broader Payment Security portfolio (detailed on page 11), which is explicitly described as being built around the 'Arcot payment authentication network powered by 3-D Secure.' The connection between the Payment Security Suite and the broader Payment Security portfolio indicates that the SaaS-based suite leverages the underlying Arcot technology to deliver its fraud protection capabilities. This alignment suggests that Broadcom integrates its foundational authentication technology into modern, cloud-delivered service models to meet evolving market needs, particularly in securing digital transactions.",

Our Symantec endpoint security solutions prevent, detect and respond to emerging threats across all devices and operating systems including laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile phones, servers and cloud workloads through an intelligent AI driven security console and single agent.\n\nNetwork Security: Email and web access are the lifeblood and essential communication means for every modern organization. We have a full array of network security solutions, as well as a shared set of advanced threat protection technologies to stop inbound and outbound threats targeting end users, information and key infrastructure.\n\nInformation Security: Information protection and compliance is critical to managing risk. We offer integrated information security solutions, based on an efficient, single-policy that can be applied across the entire environment, to help organizations identify and protect risky users, applications and their most sensitive data everywhere across endpoints, on-premises networks, cloud services and private applications.\n\nIdentity Security: User identities are under attack by cyber criminals hoping to exploit their access and privileges and do harm. We mitigate these attacks by positively identifying legitimate users, enforcing granular access control policies, and streamlining access governance to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data.\n\nFibre Channel Switch Products: Our Brocade Fibre Channel switch products provide interconnection, bandwidth and high-speed switching between servers and storage devices which are in a FC SAN. FC SANs are networks dedicated to mission critical storage traffic, and enable simultaneous high speed and secure connections among multiple host computers and multiple storage arrays.\n\nPayment Security Suite: This is a software as a service ('SaaS')-based payment authentication service to help banks and merchants protect against fraud and ensure a hassle-free online shopping experience for their customers.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nWe are committed to continuous investment in product development and enhancement, with a focus on rapidly introducing new, proprietary products and releases. Many of our products have grown out of our own research and development efforts, and have given us competitive advantages in certain target markets due to performance differentiation. However, we opportunistically seek to enhance our capabilities through the acquisition of engineers with complementary research and development skills and complementary technologies and businesses. We focus our research and development efforts on the development of mission critical, innovative, sustainable and higher value product platforms and those that improve the quality and stability in our broadly deployed products. We leverage our design capabilities in markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins by developing high value-add products.\n\nWe plan to continue investing in product development, both organically and through acquisitions, to drive growth in our business. We also invest in process development and improvements to product features and functions, as well as fabrication capabilities to optimize processes for devices that are manufactured internally. Our field application engineers, design engineers, and product and software development engineers are located in many places around the world, and in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the case of our semiconductor customers, enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products for them that leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position, and to ensure a continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.\n\n## Customers, Sales and Distribution\n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 56% and 53% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMany of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers. We have established",

For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and commercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our technologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our innovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and through the licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results of Qualcomm, its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (Note 2). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nFinancial Statement Preparation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Examples of our significant accounting estimates and policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others include: the estimation of sales-based royalty revenues; the impairment of non-marketable equity investments; the valuation of inventories; the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the recognition, measurement and disclosure of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings; and the calculation of our income tax provision, including the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nFiscal Year. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\n\nCash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and notes and certain bank time deposits, U.S. Treasury securities and governmentrelated securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\n\nMarketable Securities. Marketable securities include marketable equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities and, from time-to-time, certain time deposits. We classify marketable securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nIf a debt security has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security. For the remaining debt securities, if an unrealized loss ex ists, we separate the impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factors and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factors. Unrealized gains or unrealized losses that are not related to credit factors on available-forsale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities and subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment and other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and economy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\n\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with equity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in net earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are generally recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. We monitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee's financial condition and business forecasts and lower",

Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices.

      "question": "Given Microsoft's strategic emphasis on Industry Solutions as a key component of their Enterprise and Partner Services business, how does the 4.9% decline in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue from $7,900M in 2023 to $7,594M in 2024 reflect on the performance of this specific strategic initiative?",
      "answer": "Microsoft positions Industry Solutions as a central offering within its Enterprise and Partner Services portfolio on page 11, highlighting its role in helping customers develop, deploy, and manage Microsoft server solutions, desktop solutions, and Nuance conversational AI. This underscores the strategic importance of Industry Solutions in driving enterprise adoption and integration of Microsoft's broader product ecosystem. However, the financial data from page 93 shows that Enterprise and Partner Services revenue declined from $7,900 million in 2023 to $7,594 million in 2024, a drop of 4.9%. Since Industry Solutions is a named component of this business line, this decline suggests that either demand for these tailored industry services may have softened, or Microsoft may have faced executional challenges in scaling this initiative. This contrast between strategic emphasis and financial performance raises questions about the effectiveness of Microsoft's go-to-market strategy for Industry Solutions within the broader context of enterprise digital transformation.",

      "answer": "AMD's risk disclosure on page 23 outlines that under the Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF), AMD has annual wafer purchase targets through 2025 and may be required to pay GF a portion of the difference if those targets are not met. This creates a financial exposure risk tied to demand forecasting. The contractual amendment referenced on page 97 (Exhibit 10.63) confirms the binding nature of these commitments, including GF's obligation to provide minimum annual capacity and AMD's corresponding purchase obligations.

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's inclusion of SA in Open Value agreements affect the recognition pattern and unearned revenue treatment of multi-year licenses compared to other volume licensing programs?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's Open Value agreements, designed for small and medium organizations, include Software Assurance (SA) and allow customers to license cloud services and on-premises software over a three-year period with the option to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe. Since SA is included, it introduces complexity in determining the standalone selling price (SSP) and the pattern of delivery, requiring judgment in revenue recognition. On page 64, it is noted that SA and cloud services are part of unearned revenue, which is generally invoiced annually and recognized ratably over the coverage period. This creates a different revenue recognition and unearned revenue dynamic compared to other programs like the Microsoft Products and Services Agreement, where SA is optional, potentially altering the timing and structure of revenue recognition and unearned liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

      "question": "How does Cisco's disclosure about the $1.5 billion in interest rate swaps hedging fixed-rate senior notes affect the interpretation of their $10 billion commercial paper program, particularly in light of the $9.0 billion in senior fixed-rate notes outstanding?",
      "answer": "Cisco disclosed a $10 billion commercial paper program on page 53, with $0.6 billion outstanding as of July 30, 2022. These commercial paper notes rank at par with the senior fixed-rate notes, which totaled $9.0 billion in principal as of the same date. Cisco also disclosed that it had entered into $1.5 billion in interest rate swaps to hedge certain fixed-rate senior notes, converting their fixed interest rates to floating rates based on LIBOR. This hedging activity, detailed on page 90, suggests an active interest rate risk management strategy. Given that a 50 BPS change in interest rates would impact the fair value of the unhedged fixed-rate debt by $0.3 billion (as noted on page 57), the hedging through swaps likely mitigates some of this exposure, which in turn may influence the relative attractiveness of issuing floating-rate commercial paper versus fixed-rate debt. This interplay reveals a strategic balance between managing interest rate exposure and maintaining flexibility in short-term financing.",

We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times.

      "question": "Given Microsoft's emphasis on the Microsoft Partner Network as a strategic component of their Enterprise and Partner Services, how does the reported decline in revenue for this business segment from $7,900 million in fiscal 2023 to $7,594 million in fiscal 2024 reflect on the effectiveness of the Partner Network in driving growth for Microsoft's cloud and enterprise solutions?",
      "answer": "Microsoft positions the Microsoft Partner Network as a key enabler for customers developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server solutions, desktop solutions, and AI offerings (page 11). This network is explicitly included within the broader 'Enterprise and Partner Services' business segment, which competes with a wide range of consulting and services firms (page 10). However, the financial data from page 93 shows that this segment experienced a revenue decline from $7,900 million in fiscal 2023 to $7,594 million in fiscal 2024. This decline suggests either a contraction in demand for partner-enabled services or a strategic shift in how Microsoft delivers or monetizes these services, despite the Partner Network's stated strategic importance. This contradiction between strategic emphasis and financial performance raises questions about the alignment between Microsoft's partner ecosystem and its broader cloud and enterprise growth objectives.",

      "answer": "Apple identifies China Mainland as a key part of its supply chain and notes that trade tensions, tariffs, and other disruptions in the region could materially impact its business, particularly by increasing costs and reducing gross margins. Despite these risks, the Greater China segment\u2014which includes China Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan\u2014reported $74.2 billion in net sales in 2022, showing strong demand in the region. This suggests that while Apple faces operational and geopolitical risks in China Mainland, the broader Greater China market remains a significant revenue driver.

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "question": "How does Cisco's disclosure of interest rate sensitivity for its senior fixed-rate notes reconcile with the company's reliance on commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes, particularly considering the floating rate exposure of the latter?",
      "answer": "Cisco disclosed on page 57 that a 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of its fixed-rate debt (excluding $1.5 billion of hedged debt) by approximately $0.3 billion. This indicates sensitivity to interest rate movements despite the fixed nature of these senior notes. On page 90, it is noted that the senior fixed-rate notes rank at par with future commercial paper notes issued under the company's short-term debt program. Finally, on page 89, Cisco states that it uses proceeds from commercial paper notes, which typically carry floating interest rates, for general corporate purposes. The floating rate exposure of commercial paper means that rising interest rates would increase Cisco\u2019s short-term borrowing costs, contrasting with the largely fixed exposure profile of the senior notes. Therefore, while the senior notes provide rate stability (except for the unhedged portion), the commercial paper introduces variable rate risk, suggesting a diversified but potentially volatile debt structure.",

Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "question": "How does AMD's binding commitment under the 2022-2025 Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, including pre-payment obligations and minimum capacity allocation, reconcile with their broader supply chain risk disclosures regarding lack of long-term commitments with third-party manufacturers and potential inventory cost impacts?",
      "answer": "AMD has a binding Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. through 2025, which includes minimum annual capacity allocation from GF and corresponding annual wafer purchase targets for AMD. If AMD fails to meet these targets, it must pay a portion of the shortfall, and the company is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for wafers in 2022 and 2023. This represents a significant long-term commitment, contrasting with AMD\u2019s broader supply chain risk disclosures where they note that they do not have long-term commitment contracts with some third-party manufacturers and instead rely on purchase orders. This lack of guaranteed supply from other manufacturers introduces risks around capacity allocation, pricing, and delivery timelines. Furthermore, if AMD\u2019s actual wafer requirements fall short of the purchase targets under the WSA, the company could face excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, which may adversely impact gross margins. The WSA introduces both stability and risk, depending on AMD\u2019s ability to forecast and meet its wafer demand over the agreement\u2019s term.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's exclusion of Activision Blizzard's internal controls from its financial reporting assessment reconcile with the detailed debt obligations Activision Blizzard maintains through Wells Fargo Bank, as disclosed in Microsoft's consolidated exhibit filings?",
      "answer": "Microsoft excluded Activision Blizzard's internal controls over financial reporting from its assessment due to the acquisition occurring on October 13, 2023, with Activision Blizzard contributing less than 1% of total assets and 2% of total revenues as of June 30, 2024. However, despite this exclusion, Activision Blizzard maintains significant debt obligations through Wells Fargo Bank, including 3.400% Senior Notes due 2027, 1.350% Senior Notes due 2030, 4.500% Senior Notes due 2047, and 2.500% Senior Notes due 2050, as part of its indenture agreements. These obligations are now part of Microsoft's consolidated exhibit filings, indicating that while Activision Blizzard's internal controls were not assessed, its financial commitments are still fully integrated into Microsoft's broader financial structure and disclosure framework through its partnership with Wells Fargo Bank.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total rev enues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiv eness of internal control ov er financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control ov er financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control ov er financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and ev aluating the design and operating effectiv eness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believ e that our audit prov ides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control ov er financial reporting is a process designed to prov ide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control ov er financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) prov ide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) prov ide reasonable assurance regarding prev ention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could hav e a material effect on the financial statements.",

      "question": "How does ACN manage the financial risk associated with short-term, easily terminable client contracts while pursuing a strategy of deepening client relationships through long-term AI and managed services investments?",
      "answer": "ACN acknowledges in its accounting policies (page 43) that the majority of its contracts are terminable by clients on short notice with little or no penalties, and only the non-cancelable portion is included in performance obligations. This creates a risk of revenue volatility if clients delay, reduce, or eliminate spending. Despite this, ACN is pursuing a strategy of deepening client relationships through long-term AI and managed services investments, as noted on page 6, where it states that managed services are strategic for clients seeking to leverage AI and automation. To manage this risk, ACN emphasizes innovation and strategic investments, including $6.6 billion across 46 acquisitions in fiscal 2024, to build capabilities that align with client needs and drive long-term value. This suggests a dual approach of mitigating contract risk through continuous innovation and expansion of high-value offerings that encourage client retention and deeper partnerships.",

      "answer": "Microsoft explicitly excluded Activision Blizzard's internal controls from its 2024 financial reporting assessment, citing that Activision's financial statements constituted less than 1% of total assets and 2% of total revenues post-acquisition. However, Activision's debt obligations, including the 3.400% Senior Notes due in 2026 and 2027, remain governed under indentures originally administered by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. While Microsoft now holds a stake in Activision Blizzard, the administration of these debt instruments was later transferred to Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as evidenced by the First Supplemental Indenture dated October 27, 2023. This indicates that although Microsoft has not integrated Activision\u2019s internal financial controls into its reporting, the legacy debt structure and trustee relationships are being actively managed post-acquisition.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total rev enues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiv eness of internal control ov er financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control ov er financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control ov er financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and ev aluating the design and operating effectiv eness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believ e that our audit prov ides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control ov er financial reporting is a process designed to prov ide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control ov er financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) prov ide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) prov ide reasonable assurance regarding prev ention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could hav e a material effect on the financial statements.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's Server products and cloud services, which include Windows Server, experienced a significant 36% year-over-year revenue increase from $79,970M in 2023 to $97,726M in 2024. This growth aligns with the company's strategic emphasis on cloud-first infrastructure, particularly Azure, as outlined in the Intelligent Cloud segment description. While Windows Server remains a foundational on-premises product, its integration with Azure and positioning within a broader cloud services ecosystem reflects Microsoft's shift toward hybrid and public cloud offerings as a key competitive advantage. The revenue growth suggests strong market adoption of this integrated approach, where traditional server products are increasingly consumed as part of cloud services.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's Server products and cloud services segment grew by 22.3% year-over-year, driven in part by SQL Server's dual role as both an on-premises database solution and a foundational element of Azure cloud infrastructure. As a key part of the Intelligent Cloud segment, SQL Server is strategically positioned to serve hybrid environments, enabling customers to deploy database solutions either locally or in the cloud while maintaining compatibility and security. This flexibility, combined with integration into Azure's cloud services and licensing through CALs, supports sustained demand and contributes to the segment's significant revenue growth.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's repeated use of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company as trustee across multiple debt issuances, including the 0.875% Notes due 2013 and the 1.625% Notes due 2018, reflect a consistent capital structure management strategy, given the long-standing trustee relationship established in the Base Indenture dated May 18, 2009?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's repeated use of BNY Mellon as trustee across multiple debt issuances\u2014such as the 0.875% Notes due 2013 (Exhibit 4.5, filed September 27, 2010) and the 1.625% Notes due 2018 (Exhibit 4.11, filed December 6, 2013)\u2014demonstrates a deliberate and consistent capital structure management strategy. This approach builds on the foundational relationship established in the Base Indenture dated May 18, 2009 (Exhibit 4.1), which formalized BNY Mellon\u2019s role as trustee. By maintaining a long-standing relationship with a single trusted financial institution across multiple supplemental indentures, Microsoft likely benefits from operational efficiency, familiarity with documentation, and reduced execution risk in debt offerings. This pattern suggests that Microsoft views continuity in trustee relationships as a strategic advantage in managing its debt portfolio.",

        "Hop 2: [BNY Mellon] \u2192 [0.875% Notes due 2013]: BNY Mellon served as trustee for the 0.875% Notes due 2013 under a Supplemental Indenture dated September 27, 2010 (Exhibit 4.5), showing the institution's involvement across various debt instruments.",

      "question": "How does the change in allowance for credit losses on loan receivables from fiscal 2022 to 2023 reflect the risk profile of Cisco's financing activities tied to technical support services?",
      "answer": "The allowance for credit losses on loan receivables decreased from $103 million in fiscal 2022 to $53 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a reduced risk exposure or improved credit quality in these financing arrangements. Loan receivables are explicitly tied to Cisco's technical support and advanced services, suggesting that the company's financing risk related to these services has declined over this period. This reduction in allowance implies that Cisco may have tightened credit standards, experienced better-than-expected repayment performance, or reduced the volume of financing extended for technical support services. The decrease in allowance must be interpreted alongside the overall decrease in financing receivables (down 2% year-over-year), which suggests a contraction or recalibration in Cisco's financing activities, including those related to technical support.",

However, as part of the divestiture agreement, Intel entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, under which it continues to manufacture NAND memory wafers for SK hynix using the Dalian facility until the second closing. This ongoing manufacturing relationship supports Intel's continued innovation in NAND technology, as evidenced by its launch of the Intel SSD D5-P5316, its first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the data center, and the Intel SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND for consumers.

NSG is disrupting the memory and storage hierarchy with new tiers that balance capacity, performance, and cost. Our products are available in innovative form factors and densities to address the memory and storage challenges our customers face in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience. Put simply, in today's data-driven world, advances in both data center and client computing need to be matched by cutting-edge innovation in the memoryand-storage space.\"\n\n-Rob Crooke, NSG General Manager\n\n## 5-Year Trends",

      "question": "How does Apple's reliance on third-party content providers for digital content availability relate to its financial commitments to content licensing, given the risks associated with short-term licensing arrangements and potential cost increases?",
      "answer": "Apple's reliance on third-party content providers is a critical component of its digital ecosystem, particularly for services like the App Store and Apple's own offerings such as Apple TV+. As noted in the risk factors section (page 13), Apple contracts with numerous third parties to offer digital content, but these arrangements are often short-term and may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms. This creates a risk that content could become more expensive or unavailable altogether, which could negatively impact Apple's ability to attract and retain customers. In the commitments section (page 48), Apple discloses that it has significant future payments under unconditional purchase obligations, including for content licensing and distribution rights. These commitments imply that Apple is financially bound to maintain access to third-party content, even as it faces uncertainty in renewals and potential cost increases. The interplay between these two sections highlights a strategic tension: Apple must balance its need to secure compelling content to drive service growth and customer engagement with the financial risk of rising licensing costs and uncertain contract renewals.",

There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If  third-party  software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relativ e benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and X box for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the A pp Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the A pp Store.

From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS A pp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the A pp Store and Safari in the European Union ('EU') as it seeks to comply with the Digital M arkets A ct (the 'DM A '), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced A pp Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. \u00ae\n\n## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.

Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.

The reduction in the allowance for credit losses\u2014from $103 million to $53 million\u2014indicates management's increased confidence in the credit quality of borrowers, particularly those acquiring hardware.

      "question": "How does AMD's focus on discrete GPUs as a core product within its Gaming segment align with its acknowledgment of competitive risks posed by Intel's entry into the GPU market, especially considering their historical settlement and patent cross-license agreement?",
      "answer": "AMD identifies discrete GPUs as a key component of its Gaming segment, which is one of its four reportable segments (page 70). The company explicitly acknowledges that Intel has developed and released its own high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming-focused offerings, which pose a competitive threat (page 20). This includes the risk that Intel could leverage its market dominance to restrict access to proprietary graphics interfaces or provide preferential treatment to other competitors. Despite this competitive pressure, AMD and Intel maintain a formalized relationship through a settlement agreement and a patent cross-license agreement, both dated November 11, 2009 (page 101). This licensing relationship may serve as a strategic counterbalance to Intel's competitive actions in the GPU market, allowing AMD to navigate Intel's aggressive tactics while continuing to focus on discrete GPUs as a central element of its Gaming segment strategy.",

      "question": "How does the growth in revenue from SQL Server, as part of Server products and cloud services, align with the overall revenue reported for that segment in fiscal year 2024, and what does this imply about the contribution of SQL Server to Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud strategy?",
      "answer": "SQL Server is a key component of Microsoft\u2019s Server products and cloud services, which reported $97.726 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2024. While the exact revenue growth for SQL Server alone is not disclosed, its inclusion in the Server products and cloud services segment \u2014 alongside Azure, Windows Server, and other critical infrastructure tools \u2014 indicates that SQL Server contributes significantly to the growth and profitability of this segment. Given that Server products and cloud services grew from $67.350 billion in 2022 to $97.726 billion in 2024, SQL Server likely plays a central role in supporting Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud strategy by enabling enterprise data management, integration with Azure, and licensing through volume programs and OEMs. This underscores its strategic importance in driving both on-premises and hybrid cloud adoption.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers.

      "question": "How does Microsoft's recurring use of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company as trustee for multiple debt issuances, including the 4.50% Notes due 2040, reflect on the strategic and legal structuring of its long-term debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Microsoft has consistently used The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company (BNY Mellon) as trustee for multiple debt issuances, including the 4.50% Notes due 2040, as evidenced by the repeated inclusion of BNY Mellon in supplemental indentures dating back to 2009. This pattern, seen on page 105, shows a long-standing legal and administrative relationship. The 4.50% Notes due 2040 are specifically governed under a Second Supplemental Indenture dated September 27, 2010, which builds upon the Base Indenture from May 18, 2009, indicating a layered legal structure for managing long-term debt. The continued use of BNY Mellon suggests a deliberate choice for continuity, legal consistency, and institutional trust in handling complex, long-duration obligations like the 2040 notes. This strategic legal structuring supports Microsoft\u2019s broader capital management framework by ensuring standardized governance across different debt instruments.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's judgment in determining standalone selling prices (SSP) for products sold with Software Assurance (SA), such as Open Value agreements, affect the recognition pattern and unearned revenue timing for small and medium-sized customers purchasing under multi-year licensing programs?",
      "answer": "Microsoft applies judgment to determine the standalone selling price (SSP) for products sold with Software Assurance (SA), particularly for offerings like Open Value agreements aimed at small and medium organizations. Since SA is included in Open Value agreements and not sold separately, Microsoft uses a single estimated SSP for these bundled offerings, which affects how revenue is allocated across performance obligations. This judgment impacts the recognition pattern, as revenue for multi-year on-premises licenses is recognized upfront while the SA component is recognized ratably over the three-year agreement term. This also affects unearned revenue timing, as payments for Open Value agreements are typically invoiced annually and recognized ratably over the coverage period, contributing to the $3.8 billion in long-term accounts receivable and the broader unearned revenue base as of June 30, 2022.",

        "Hop 2: [SA] \u2192 [Open Value]: Open Value agreements include SA as part of the licensing package for small and medium organizations, and are structured over a three-year period, making SA an inseparable part of the contract and influencing how SSP and revenue recognition are applied.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items  that  are  not  sold  separately,  including  on-premises  licenses  sold  with  SA  or  software  updates  provided  at  no  additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable  consideration  were  not  material  for  the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a  receivable  when  revenue  is recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is  recognized  subsequent  to  invoicing.  For  multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related  to  revenue  recognized  for  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  as  we  have  an  unconditional  right  to  invoice  and  receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.",

Our Symantec endpoint security solutions prevent, detect and respond to emerging threats across all devices and operating systems including laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile phones, servers and cloud workloads through an intelligent AI driven security console and single agent.\n\nNetwork Security: Email and web access are the lifeblood and essential communication means for every modern organization. We have a full array of network security solutions, as well as a shared set of advanced threat protection technologies to stop inbound and outbound threats targeting end users, information and key infrastructure.\n\nInformation Security: Information protection and compliance is critical to managing risk. We offer integrated information security solutions, based on an efficient, single-policy that can be applied across the entire environment, to help organizations identify and protect risky users, applications and their most sensitive data everywhere across endpoints, on-premises networks, cloud services and private applications.\n\nIdentity Security: User identities are under attack by cyber criminals hoping to exploit their access and privileges and do harm. We mitigate these attacks by positively identifying legitimate users, enforcing granular access control policies, and streamlining access governance to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data.\n\nFibre Channel Switch Products: Our Brocade Fibre Channel switch products provide interconnection, bandwidth and high-speed switching between servers and storage devices which are in a FC SAN. FC SANs are networks dedicated to mission critical storage traffic, and enable simultaneous high speed and secure connections among multiple host computers and multiple storage arrays.\n\nPayment Security Suite: This is a software as a service ('SaaS')-based payment authentication service to help banks and merchants protect against fraud and ensure a hassle-free online shopping experience for their customers.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nWe are committed to continuous investment in product development and enhancement, with a focus on rapidly introducing new, proprietary products and releases. Many of our products have grown out of our own research and development efforts, and have given us competitive advantages in certain target markets due to performance differentiation. However, we opportunistically seek to enhance our capabilities through the acquisition of engineers with complementary research and development skills and complementary technologies and businesses. We focus our research and development efforts on the development of mission critical, innovative, sustainable and higher value product platforms and those that improve the quality and stability in our broadly deployed products. We leverage our design capabilities in markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins by developing high value-add products.\n\nWe plan to continue investing in product development, both organically and through acquisitions, to drive growth in our business. We also invest in process development and improvements to product features and functions, as well as fabrication capabilities to optimize processes for devices that are manufactured internally. Our field application engineers, design engineers, and product and software development engineers are located in many places around the world, and in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the case of our semiconductor customers, enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products for them that leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position, and to ensure a continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.\n\n## Customers, Sales and Distribution\n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 56% and 53% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMany of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers. We have established",

The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

      "answer": "The U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan's 64% allocation to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents in 2021, as disclosed on page 50, indicates a conservative investment strategy for this plan. This aligns with the $251 million reported value of Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents as of December 31, 2020, from page 49, which constitutes the majority of the plan's total assets of $389 million. Together, these figures suggest that TXN maintains a consistent, fixed-income-focused asset allocation for this specific pension plan, likely aiming to ensure stable returns and lower volatility. The combination of percentage allocation and actual dollar values demonstrates a dual approach to asset reporting\u2014qualitative strategic intent paired with quantitative transparency\u2014highlighting a deliberate and methodical pension fund management strategy.",

However, the filing also notes that Samsung is developing its own integrated circuit products, which it increasingly uses in its own devices rather than Qualcomm's chipsets, creating a competitive threat to Qualcomm\u2019s semiconductor business. In response, Qualcomm emphasizes in its MD&A that it derives revenues 'principally' from sales of integrated circuit products and continues to invest heavily in R&D to enhance existing technologies and develop new ones for industries beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT. This dual reality\u2014Samsung's dual role as both a major customer and an aggressive competitor\u2014appears to be shaping Qualcomm\u2019s strategy of diversifying its product portfolio and customer base, while continuing to invest in innovation to maintain its competitive edge.",

QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including, but not limited to, 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business, our cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\n## Revenue Concentrations and Significant Customers\n\nA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2022, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies' and 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the use of 5G, the expansion into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies.

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to those described in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in 'Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and 2021. Discussions of fiscal 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2021.\n\n## Our Business and Operating Segments\n\nWe develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\nFurther information regarding our business and operating segments is provided in 'Part I, Item 1.

      "question": "Given Qualcomm's stated dependency on 5G technology demand and its role in enabling immersive XR experiences, how does the company's reported QCT segment revenue exposure to XR in fiscal 2023 position it to benefit from or be at risk to fluctuations in 5G adoption cycles?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's business is explicitly tied to the success of 5G technology adoption, as stated in the risk factors on page 5, where it notes that its revenues depend on customer demand for products based on communications technologies like 5G. This dependency is further contextualized on page 7, which explains that 5G's low latency and high data rates are foundational for immersive experiences such as XR, including AR, VR, and MR. However, page 73 reveals that XR is included within the broader QCT segment revenue categorized under consumer applications, alongside PCs, tablets, and voice/music devices. The lack of a specific revenue percentage attributed solely to XR, combined with its dependency on 5G infrastructure, suggests that Qualcomm's financial exposure to XR growth is significant but indirect. Therefore, while XR represents a growth opportunity tied to 5G adoption, fluctuations in 5G deployment could proportionally impact Qualcomm's XR-related revenue stream.",

      "question": "Given that Activision Blizzard contributes less than 1% of Microsoft's total assets and 2% of its revenues, how does the fact that Activision Blizzard maintains its own separate debt obligations, including the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, impact Microsoft's consolidated financial risk profile?",
      "answer": "Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard on October 13, 2023, but excluded it from the assessment and audit of internal controls over financial reporting due to its relatively small contribution to Microsoft's consolidated financials\u2014less than 1% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles) and 2% of total revenues. Despite this exclusion, Activision Blizzard maintains its own debt obligations, such as the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, which are governed under separate indentures. This creates a nuanced financial risk dynamic: while Activision Blizzard\u2019s debt does not directly affect Microsoft\u2019s internal control framework, it remains part of Microsoft\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, although the exposure is limited in scale, the separation of control and governance over Activision Blizzard\u2019s liabilities introduces a potential risk to Microsoft\u2019s consolidated financial position, particularly if Activision Blizzard faces financial distress or covenant violations on these notes.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total rev enues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiv eness of internal control ov er financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control ov er financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control ov er financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and ev aluating the design and operating effectiv eness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believ e that our audit prov ides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control ov er financial reporting is a process designed to prov ide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control ov er financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) prov ide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) prov ide reasonable assurance regarding prev ention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could hav e a material effect on the financial statements.",

      "question": "How did Notice 2023-55's delay of the final foreign tax credit regulations impact Microsoft's effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023, and what does this reveal about the company's international tax planning strategy in light of its Ireland-based operations?",
      "answer": "Notice 2023-55 delayed the effective date of the final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft, which contributed to an 18% effective tax rate in FY2024 compared to 19% in FY2023. This tax benefit, along with Notice 2023-80\u2019s indefinite delay of the regulations, allowed Microsoft to maintain a favorable tax position. The company's Ireland-based foreign regional operations center generated 83% of its foreign income before tax in FY2024, which is taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rate. This indicates a strategic reliance on international operations to manage tax liabilities while navigating evolving U.S. tax regulations, leveraging temporary regulatory delays to optimize tax outcomes.",

        "Hop 1: [MSFT](page_47) \u2192 [Notice 2023-55]: Microsoft attributes a portion of its reduced effective tax rate (18% in FY2024 vs. 19% in FY2023) to Notice 2023-55, which delayed the effective date of the final foreign tax credit regulations to FY2024.",
        "Hop 2: [Notice 2023-55] \u2192 [Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations]: Notice 2023-55 specifically delayed the implementation of the final foreign tax credit regulations, which would otherwise have taken effect earlier and potentially increased Microsoft\u2019s tax liability.",
        "Hop 3: [Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations] \u2190 [MSFT](page_82): Microsoft notes that the delay of these regulations contributed to tax benefits in FY2024, and the company continues to rely on its Ireland-based operations, which accounted for 83% of foreign pre-tax income, to maintain a lower effective tax rate."

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## Effective Tax Rate\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectiv ely. The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

      "answer": "Microsoft demonstrates a deliberate strategy in assigning trustees across its debt instruments, as evidenced by the use of BNY Mellon Trust Company, N.A. for long-dated notes like the 4.50% Notes due 2040 and the transition to U.S. Bank National Association for more recent issuances across various maturities (e.g., 2025, 2035, 2045, and 2055). This diversification of trustee relationships suggests an effort to mitigate concentration risk, leverage institutional expertise across different debt structures, and possibly optimize administrative efficiency or cost structures depending on the complexity and duration of the instrument. The pattern indicates a strategic, risk-aware capital management framework.",

      "answer": "The 79% allocation to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents in 2021 for the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan suggests a conservative investment strategy aimed at preserving capital and minimizing volatility in plan assets. This aligns with the plan\u2019s reported $81 million negative expected return on plan assets, which may reflect low-yield environments or strategic decisions to prioritize stability over growth. Despite this conservative stance, the plan reported $0 net periodic benefit cost, indicating that the asset allocation may have helped offset some liabilities or that other adjustments neutralized the cost. This combination suggests a cautious approach to pension fund management, balancing liability coverage with risk-averse asset performance.",
