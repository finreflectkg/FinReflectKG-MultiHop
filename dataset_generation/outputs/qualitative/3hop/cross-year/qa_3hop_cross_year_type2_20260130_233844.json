      "question": "How did AVGO's financial exposure to the 5.000% notes due April 2030 evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "AVGO's exposure to the 5.000% notes due April 2030 decreased from $1,086 million in 2022 to $606 million in 2023, and remained at $606 million in 2024. This indicates a deliberate debt reduction strategy, with the company actively managing its outstanding obligations related to these notes over the three-year period.",

      "answer": "AVGO's outstanding principal balance for the 3.125% notes due January 2025 remained unchanged at $495 million from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2023, but in fiscal 2024, it was still reported at $495 million despite approaching maturity, indicating no principal reduction over the three-year period. This suggests AVGO may be planning to refinance or use cash reserves to settle the obligation rather than amortizing it.",

      "question": "How did AVGO's financial exposure to the 3.625% notes due October 2024 evolve from fiscal year 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's debt management strategy around this instrument?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO reported $622 million in principal outstanding for the 3.625% notes due October 2024. By 2023, this amount remained unchanged at $622 million, indicating no repayments or modifications during the year. However, by 2024, the company no longer listed any outstanding principal for these notes, suggesting that the debt was either fully repaid or refinanced ahead of its maturity. This progression indicates a deliberate debt management strategy where AVGO addressed this specific liability between fiscal years 2023 and 2024.",

      "question": "How did the positioning and described capabilities of AVGO's Security Insights Platform evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of integration with external tools, remediation processes, and alignment with broader cybersecurity strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Security Insights Platform was described as a solution that interprets and assesses mainframe security posture, identifies risks, and develops remediation steps, with data available for use with in-house tools for security information and event management (SIEM). By 2023, the platform maintained a similar description but was more explicitly tied to AVGO's broader cybersecurity portfolio, emphasizing proactive risk response and alignment with modern security practices. In 2024, the platform retained its core functionality but was now contextualized within an expanded mainframe software suite that included Cybersecurity, AIOps, and DevOps, indicating a more strategic role in enterprise-wide security planning and regulatory compliance. This evolution shows a shift from a standalone risk assessment tool toward a more integrated and strategically aligned component of AVGO\u2019s cybersecurity offerings.",

      "answer": "AVGO's outstanding balance on the 5.000% notes due April 2030 decreased from $606 million in fiscal 2022 to $606 million in fiscal 2023 and remained unchanged in fiscal 2024, while the effective interest rate stayed constant at 5.18%. This stability in both principal and interest rate over three years suggests a consistent long-term debt strategy with no early redemption or refinancing activity for this particular note, indicating strategic intent to maintain this liability on its balance sheet.",

      "question": "How did AVGO's positioning of Industrial Fiber Optics within its broader industrial product portfolio evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of application diversity and integration with adjacent technologies like motion encoders and Ethernet ICs?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AVGO consistently positioned Industrial Fiber Optics as a core component of its industrial product portfolio, but the context of its integration and application scope evolved. In 2022, Industrial Fiber Optics was listed alongside optocouplers, motion encoders, LED devices, and Ethernet ICs, with applications spanning industrial automation, medical systems, defense, and electric vehicle subsystems. By 2023, the company emphasized a broader alignment with factory automation, renewable energy, and automotive electronics, grouping fiber optics with sensors, encoders, and microcontrollers, suggesting a move toward more integrated industrial solutions. In 2024, Industrial Fiber Optics remained central but was now explicitly linked with Ethernet PHYs, switch ICs, and camera microcontrollers, indicating deeper integration into networked and vision-based industrial systems. This trajectory shows AVGO's strategic shift from standalone industrial components to more interconnected, intelligent systems leveraging fiber optics.",

      "answer": "AVGO's outstanding principal balance for the 3.125% notes due January 2025 remained unchanged at $495 million in fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024. This stability suggests that AVGO did not retire or refinance this specific debt instrument during the three-year period, maintaining a consistent liability profile for this bond despite broader changes in its overall debt structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO had $622 million in 3.625% notes due October 2024 outstanding. By 2023, this amount had not yet changed, remaining at $622 million. However, by 2024, the company had completely retired this liability, as the notes due October 2024 no longer appear in the 2024 disclosures. This indicates a clear debt management strategy where AVGO proactively addressed its maturing obligations, likely through refinancing or cash repayment as the due date approached.",

        "Hop 1: AVGO (2022) \u2192 3.625% notes due October 2024: AVGO had $622 million outstanding.",

        "Hop 3: AVGO (2024) \u2192 3.625% notes due October 2024: The notes no longer appear in the disclosures, indicating full repayment or retirement."

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AVGO consistently described the Security Insights Platform as a tool for assessing mainframe security posture and identifying risks, but the emphasis on integration with in-house tools and remediation workflows became more pronounced over time. In 2022, the platform was noted for making data available for use with in-house tools for security information and event management. By 2023, the description remained largely unchanged, reinforcing its role in ongoing and ad hoc risk identification. In 2024, the language remained consistent, indicating that AVGO maintained a stable value proposition without expanding on new integrations or remediation features during the three-year period.",

In 2022, the company described the broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products as a key driver of customer opportunity and investment value. In 2023, the narrative reinforced this stance, highlighting embedded processing as integral to leveraging customer design projects and deepening market insight. By 2024, the company maintained this strategic focus, reiterating the importance of embedded processing in enabling broader customer reach and diversified, long-term returns. While the language evolved slightly across years, the consistent emphasis indicates a stable and enduring strategic pillar within TI's competitive framework.",

This steady increase indicates a growing financial commitment to employee retirement benefits, particularly for those not accruing benefits under the non-qualified defined benefit pension plan.

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares and 7 million shares valued at $1.16 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in both 2021 and 2020 were $27 million. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $63 million in 2021 and $61 million in 2020 and 2019.",

By 2024, the company continued to operate in Melaka, Malaysia only for the Analog segment.

      "question": "How did the availability of shares under the Texas Instruments 2003 Director Compensation Plan evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about TI's long-term director compensation strategy and equity utilization?",
      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, the availability of shares under the Texas Instruments 2003 Director Compensation Plan gradually declined, reflecting a strategic shift toward newer plans like the 2024 LTIP. In 2022, the 2003 plan was still referenced as part of the outstanding equity compensation structure, though no specific remaining shares were listed. By 2023, the 2003 plan was still included in the list of active plans but had no remaining shares available for future issuance, as focus shifted to the 2009 LTIP and 2018 Director Plan. In 2024, the 2003 Director Compensation Plan was still listed but was no longer referenced as a source of future issuance, with the 2024 LTIP now taking precedence. This indicates a phased retirement of older plans in favor of updated, more flexible compensation structures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [TXN](2022) \u2192 [2003 Director Compensation Plan]: The 2003 plan was listed among active plans, though no specific remaining shares were quantified, suggesting it was still in use but nearing exhaustion.",
        "Hop 2: [TXN](2023) \u2192 [2003 Director Compensation Plan]: The 2003 plan remained listed but was no longer referenced for future issuance, with available shares only reported for the 2009 LTIP and 2018 Director Plan, indicating declining relevance.",
        "Hop 3: [TXN](2024) \u2192 [2003 Director Compensation Plan]: The 2003 plan was still mentioned but was clearly no longer a source of future grants, with the new 2024 LTIP now included as a primary plan, signaling a formal transition in compensation policy."

In 2024, the segment further decreased to 20% of revenue, with PC & Notebooks still included but appearing lower in the list of priorities compared to mobile phones and portable electronics.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Cisco reported a carrying amount of $500 million for the 3.50% Note with an effective interest rate of 3.20%. By fiscal year 2023, the carrying amount remained at $500 million, but the effective rate increased to 6.38%, and in fiscal year 2024, the effective rate further rose to 6.66%, maintaining the same $500 million carrying amount. This upward trend in the effective rate indicates a shift in market conditions or internal risk assessments affecting the valuation of this long-term debt instrument over the three-year period.",

      "answer": "Cisco's financial exposure tied to Total Return Swaps-Deferred Compensation shifted significantly across the three fiscal years: in 2022, the company recorded a loss of $92 million; in 2023, this turned into a gain of $58 million; and by 2024, the gain further increased to $91 million.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco disclosed the composition and value of its AFS debt investments, indicating active portfolio management. By fiscal 2023, the company reported higher losses from these AFS debt investments, which negatively impacted its other income (loss), net. This trend continued into fiscal 2024, where AFS debt investment losses again contributed to a decline in other income (loss), net, despite offsetting gains from equity and private investments. The recurring negative impact from AFS debt investments over two consecutive years reveals a trend of increasing volatility in Cisco\u2019s investment portfolio, particularly in its debt holdings, which has affected overall financial stability in non-operational income streams.",

In 2022, Cisco emphasized its status as a founding signer of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and its participation in the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium, using analytics to test for pay parity and correct gaps. By 2023, the company expanded its pay parity program beyond base salary to include promotions, bonuses, and stock decisions, integrating global self-reported diversity data into its analysis. In 2024, Cisco maintained this expanded framework and continued to highlight its commitment to fairness across all forms of compensation, while also reinforcing its broader diversity and inclusion initiatives, including a 36% female representation on the Executive Leadership Team as of July 2024.

The CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity - including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, ex perience, strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: As of July 27, 2024, 36% of our Ex ecutive Leadership Team (EL T) are women and 43% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity.\n\nWe publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2023 data, our global employee base was comprised of 29% women, 71% men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 48.2% White/Caucasian, 33.5% Asian, 6.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5.6% African American/Black, 2.0% two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino), 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 3.7% prefer to not to disclose/unknown.\n\nWith respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our positive impact. We have published our Social Justice Beliefs &amp; Actions, which is our blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background which is the foundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office helps drive accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and suppliers.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performance-based compensation aligned with each employee's contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions.\n\nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signatory of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org  pledge,  and  are  a  leader  in  the  charge  to  make  fair  pay  a  reality  for  all  employees  through  the  Employers  for  Pay  Equity  Consortium.  We  have  also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\n\nAs part of our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions, we have expanded our pay parity program beyond base salary to include additional forms of compensation fairness such as promotion, bonuses, and stock decisions made in our rewards programs. We aim to ensure the program addresses all employees across the full spectrum of diversity incorporating our global self-reported data collection.\n\n## Health &amp; Well-being\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We seek to provide our employees and their families with highquality, flex ible, and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. We strive to support our employees as they balance careers and personal lives, as well as their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other matters.\n\nWe host ongoing discussions with our employees during the Cisco Beat and Cisco Check-Ins, our regular company-wide virtual meetings, and continue to emphasize our Safe to Talk program. We offer mindfulness courses, employee assistance program offerings, and out-of-network provider benefits for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2024, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We employ a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe know careers are not static pathways that look the same for everyone. We also know that the world of work will continue to rapidly evolve, requiring new skillsets. At Cisco, we believe that your career is owned by you, supported by your leader, and enabled by Cisco. Cisco believes in open-ended self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows best what skills and resources they need to succeed. This means that while each employee has the power to shape their career on their own terms, they also have a supportive ecosystem to develop the skills they need to succeed both today and tomorrow.

We provide our employees and their families high-quality, flexible and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal lives, all while managing their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We developed a COVID-19 response and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health. In fiscal 2022, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We have moved towards a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe believe in open-ended, self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need to succeed. We encourage employees to explore assignments outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work. Employees choose their own career paths and we support that choice by providing them with tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nWe believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes regular, virtual all hands, which we refer to as a 'Cisco Check-In,' and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a 'Team Space Check-In.' Our regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cisco Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from business updates to social justice to physical and mental health.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we have seen high level of employee engagement. For example, there were approximately 2.1 million Team Space Check-Ins  by  our  employees  in  fiscal  2022,  reflecting  87%  of  employees  submitting  Team  Space  Check-Ins.  Employees  also participate  in  our  global  Engagement  Pulse  Survey  and  the  Real  Deal  Survey.  These  surveys  allow  our  employees  to  provide confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.\n\n## Purpose Report\n\nAdditional information regarding Cisco's ESG initiatives and our people, as well as our workforce diversity data, can be found in our Purpose Report and related supplemental information, which are located on our ESG Reporting Hub at https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en\\_us/about/csr/esg-hub.html.

      "question": "How did AMD's revenue recognition approach for development and IP licensing agreements evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to the distinction between combined arrangements and standalone licensing deals?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD maintained a consistent revenue recognition framework for development and IP licensing agreements, recognizing revenue over time for combined arrangements and at a point in time for standalone licenses. In 2022, AMD emphasized that combined development and IP arrangements were evaluated for distinct performance obligations, with non-distinct licenses combined with development services and recognized over time. By 2023 and 2024, this policy remained unchanged, with the company continuing to recognize revenue for distinct licenses at a point in time when the customer can benefit from the IP, and for non-distinct licenses over time. Despite no explicit quantitative metrics being disclosed, the consistency in policy suggests a stable approach to IP monetization across all three years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AMD](2022) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: In 2022, AMD disclosed its policy of evaluating whether a licensing component in combined arrangements was distinct, recognizing revenue over time if not distinct, and at a point in time if distinct.",
        "Hop 2: [AMD](2023) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: In 2023, AMD reiterated the same revenue recognition approach, maintaining that combined arrangements with development services and non-distinct licenses were recognized over time, while distinct licenses were recognized at a point in time.",
        "Hop 3: [AMD](2024) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: In 2024, AMD continued to apply the same recognition logic, with no material changes to how it accounted for development and IP licensing agreements, indicating policy continuity."

          "chunk_text": "## Custom products\n\nCustom products which are associated with the Company's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semicustom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company's satisfaction of its performance obligation.\n\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n## Development and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  the  Company  may  enter  into  arrangements  with  customers  that  combine  the  provision  of development services and a license to the right to use the Company's IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or  multiple  performance  obligations  based  upon  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  Revenue  is  recognized  upon  the transfer  of  control,  over  time  or  at  a  point  in  time,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  The  Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct  and  (ii)  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  arrangement.  If  the  license  is  not  distinct,  it  is  combined  with  the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its  patents  or  IP .  Generally,  there  are  no  performance  obligations  beyond  transferring  the  designated  license  to  the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company's standard contractual terms, which  are  typically  net  30  to  60  days.  The  Company  has  determined  that  it  does  not  have  significant  financing components in its contracts with customers.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions  about future demand  and  market  conditions. In determining excess  or obsolescence  reserves  for  its  products,  the  Company  considers  assumptions  such  as  changes  in  business  and economic  conditions,  other-than-temporary  decreases  in  demand  for  its  products,  and  changes  in  technology  or customer  requirements.  In  determining  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value  reserves,  the  Company  considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company  fully  reserves  for  inventories  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  for  inventory  deemed  obsolete.  The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  to  anticipated  usage  using  recent  historical  activity  as  well  as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.",

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to the risk of losing tax and tariff exemptions evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year trend suggest about the company's increasing reliance on international operations and geopolitical sensitivity?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD identified the potential loss or modification of tax and tariff exemptions as one of several operational risks tied to its global footprint. By 2023, the company reiterated this risk and expanded its disclosures to include climate-related disruptions and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan, indicating a growing awareness of external pressures on its international operations. In 2024, AMD not only maintained this risk disclosure but also emphasized the impact of recent geopolitical events, such as sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict and the potential disruption of Taiwan-based manufacturing partners. The consistent mention of tax and tariff exemption risk across all three years, combined with an expanding scope of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, shows an increasing sensitivity to international regulatory shifts and a deepening complexity in managing global operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD(2022) \u2192 Tax and Tariff Exemptions: AMD listed the risk of loss or modification of tax and tariff exemptions among other geopolitical and economic risks in its 10-K filing, signaling early awareness of regulatory exposure.",

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).\n\nCustomers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers' needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers' time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.\n\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\n\nTwo customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe  focus  on  three  types  of  OEM  partners:  multi-nationals,  selected  regional  accounts  and  some  local  system integrators,  who  target  commercial  and  consumer  end  customers  of  all  sizes.  Large  multi-nationals  and  regional accounts  are  the  core  of  our  OEM  partners'  business;  however,  we  are  increasingly  focused  on  the  Value  Added Reseller  (VAR)  channel  which  resells  OEM  systems  to  the  mid-market  and  the  small  and  medium  business  (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with  their  software  and  services  solutions  into  Enterprise,  HPC  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  Customers.  Our  OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors  handle  a  wide  variety  of  products,  and  may  include  those  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our  agreements  with  distributors  protect  their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements  with  our  distributors  may  contain  standard  stock  rotation  provisions  permitting  limited  levels  of  product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.",

Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.

We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD referenced the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan as part of a broader list of exhibits, indicating its continued presence in the company's executive compensation structure. In 2023, the plan was again listed among key compensation documents, showing no changes or amendments were disclosed during this period. By 2024, the plan remained a referenced exhibit without any updates, suggesting that AMD maintained the plan in its original form throughout the three-year period. This consistency indicates that the 2011 plan has remained a stable and integral component of AMD's executive incentive framework without requiring revision, signaling long-term alignment with the company's leadership strategy.",

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to its expanding international manufacturing footprint in China, Malaysia, and Taiwan?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD highlighted difficulties in protecting intellectual property as part of its broader foreign operations risk factors, noting its reliance on third-party manufacturing in Asia and exposure to geopolitical and legal uncertainties. By 2023, AMD reiterated these concerns while specifying its manufacturing footprint in China, Malaysia, and Taiwan, and noting that 65% of its net revenue came from international sales, amplifying its exposure to IP risks. In 2024, AMD again emphasized the same IP protection difficulties, but now in the context of recent geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia, as well as China and Taiwan, which introduced new export control regulations and sanctions that further complicated its international operations. The consistent mention of IP protection challenges across all three years, combined with AMD's growing international manufacturing dependencies and evolving geopolitical pressures, indicates a persistent and intensifying risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AMD](2022) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD identified IP protection challenges as part of its global operations risk, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where it relies on third-party manufacturing in Asia.",
        "Hop 2: [AMD](2023) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD reiterated IP risks and added context about its international manufacturing presence in China, Malaysia, and Taiwan, with 65% of revenue from international sales, increasing exposure.",
        "Hop 3: [AMD](2024) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD continued to cite IP protection issues, now against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions and new export control regulations affecting its operations in Taiwan and other Asian manufacturing hubs."

          "chunk_text": "The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection  measures  and  import  or  export  licensing  requirements;  difficulties  in  protecting  our  intellectual  property; difficulties  in  managing  staffing  and  exposure  to  different  employment  practices  and  labor  laws;  changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes  in  freight  and  interest  rates;  inflation;  disruption  in  air  transportation  between  the  United  States  and  our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with United States laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nIn  addition,  our  worldwide  operations  (or  those  of  our  business  partners)  could  be  subject  to  natural  disasters  and climate  change  such  as  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  flooding,  typhoons,  droughts,  fires,  extreme  heat  and  volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.  The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Any impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe account for certain acquisitions, including the X ilinx, Inc. (X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

      "answer": "AVGO's outstanding principal balance for the 5.000% notes due April 2030 was $1,086 million in fiscal year 2022, decreased to $606 million in fiscal year 2023, and remained unchanged at $606 million in fiscal year 2024.

      "answer": "In 2022, Broadcom positioned Industrial Fiber Optics as part of a broad industrial product suite used across applications like industrial automation, power systems, medical equipment, defense, aerospace, and automotive subsystems, including electric vehicles. In 2023, the company maintained this positioning but placed Industrial Fiber Optics within a structured table format that emphasized its role in Factory Automation, Renewable Energy, and Automotive Electronics. By 2024, Industrial Fiber Optics remained a core offering under the Industrial end markets, listed alongside optocouplers, sensors, encoders, and Ethernet ICs, but with a more streamlined presentation that emphasized integration with broader semiconductor solutions. This evolution shows a consistent strategic focus on industrial markets, with increasing emphasis on structured, application-specific clarity in product communication.",

      "question": "How did Broadcom's (AVGO) financial obligations tied to its 3.125% notes due January 2025 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's short-term debt management and refinancing strategy?",
      "answer": "Broadcom's financial obligation related to the 3.125% notes due January 2025 remained stable at $495 million in both fiscal years 2022 and 2023, indicating no principal repayment or issuance changes during that period.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, AVGO had an outstanding principal balance of $622 million for the 3.625% notes due October 2024. By fiscal year 2023, this balance remained unchanged at $622 million as reported in the October 29, 2023 column. However, by fiscal year 2024, the balance for these notes had dropped to $0 million, as shown in the November 3, 2024 column. This progression indicates that AVGO fully repaid the 3.625% notes due October 2024 between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, reflecting a deliberate debt management strategy to retire this obligation before its maturity date.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, the Security Insights Platform was described as a solution that interprets and assesses mainframe security posture, identifies risks, and develops remediation steps, with data available for use with in-house tools for security information and event management. In 2023, the platform retained these core functions but was more explicitly positioned within a broader mainframe software portfolio that emphasized automation, compliance, and risk identification. By 2024, the description remained consistent with 2023, but the context expanded to include greater alignment with hybrid environments and modern cybersecurity practices, indicating a strategic emphasis on integration and adaptability. This evolution shows a consistent core function with increasing emphasis on integration and modernization across the three years.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's carrying value for the 3.50% Notes Due 2050 decreased from $2,147 million in fiscal year 2022 to $1,604 million in fiscal year 2023, and remained stable at $2,000 million in fiscal year 2024. This suggests a strategic reduction in the early years, followed by stabilization, potentially reflecting refinancing or active debt management decisions.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's exposure to the 2.00% Notes Due 2031 increased from $1.2 billion in 2022 to $1.057 billion in 2023, and then rose further to $1.25 billion in 2024, indicating a consistent long-term debt position with this instrument. This pattern suggests that NVIDIA maintained or slightly increased its long-term liability in the Notes Due 2031 over the three-year period, reflecting a stable approach to long-term financing.",

      "question": "How has the competitive positioning of Lumentum Holdings in NVIDIA's networking product segment evolved from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the intensity and technological focus of competition in optical interconnect solutions?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lumentum Holdings consistently appeared in NVIDIA\u2019s list of competitors in the networking segment, specifically in the domain of optical modules and interconnect solutions. In 2022, Lumentum was listed among competitors like Applied Optoelectronics, Arista Networks, and Broadcom, indicating early-stage competitive pressure in optical interconnects. By 2023 and 2024, Lumentum remained a named competitor, but the context shifted as NVIDIA emphasized increasing competition from companies offering 'high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies.' This suggests that Lumentum's role as a competitive force in optical networking grew in relevance alongside NVIDIA's expansion into AI-driven data center infrastructure. The persistence of Lumentum in all three years highlights a sustained and intensifying rivalry, especially as optical interconnects became more critical for high-speed AI and cloud computing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NVDA(2022) \u2192 Lumentum Holdings: Lumentum is listed among competitors in interconnect, switch, and cable solutions, signaling early-stage competitive pressure in optical modules.",

Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;\n- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n- the  commercial  significance  of  our  operations  and  our  competitors'  operations  in  particular  countries  and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods.

      "question": "How did AMD's revenue recognition policy for combined development and IP licensing agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of performance obligations and timing of revenue recognition?",
      "answer": "AMD's revenue recognition policy for combined development and IP licensing agreements remained consistent from 2022 through 2024, with no material changes in how performance obligations are evaluated or when revenue is recognized. In all three years, AMD assessed whether the licensing component was distinct based on two criteria: (i) whether it was capable of being distinct and (ii) whether it was distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license was not distinct, it was combined with development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If distinct, revenue was recognized at a point in time when the customer could benefit from the license. The policy explicitly stated in each year that there were no variable consideration estimates associated with these arrangements, indicating a stable accounting treatment across the three-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD(2023) \u2192 Development and IP Licensing Agreements: Policy remained unchanged from prior years; revenue recognized over time if license not distinct, at a point in time if distinct, with no variable consideration estimates.",

In 2024, AMD elevated the risk further, explicitly linking it to ongoing geopolitical conflicts and indicating a heightened concern over potential regulatory changes affecting its international business.

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.  The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.",

      "question": "How did AMD's strategy and relationship with AIB Manufacturers evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of inventory protection policies and the role of discrete graphics solutions in differentiation for system integrators?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD consistently emphasized inventory protection for AIB manufacturers against price reductions across all years. In 2022 and 2023, AMD highlighted that AIBs build and sell board-level products using AMD's graphics and chipset technology, which are then sold to system integrators (SIs), retailers, and sub-distributors. By 2024, AMD maintained this inventory protection policy but placed more emphasis on SIs selling based on regional or product-based strengths and responding quickly to new technologies. Throughout the period, AMD underscored the importance of discrete graphics solutions as a key differentiator for SIs to add value to their customers. However, in 2024, there was a subtle shift in language, indicating a more strategic alignment with SIs who integrate AMD-based AIB products into differentiated offerings, suggesting a deepening of the value proposition for AIBs within the broader ecosystem.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD(2023) \u2192 AIB Manufacturers: AMD offered component-level graphics and chipset products to AIBs, who build board-level products using AMD technology. Agreements protected AIB inventory against price reductions.",
        "Hop 2: AMD(2024) \u2192 AIB Manufacturers: AMD continued offering component-level graphics and chipset products to AIBs, with agreements protecting inventory against price reductions. Emphasis increased on SIs using discrete graphics to differentiate their offerings.",
        "Hop 3: AMD(2022) \u2192 AIB Manufacturers: AMD sold component-level graphics and chipset products to AIBs who built board-level products for SIs, retailers, and sub-distributors. Inventory protection policies were already in place."

Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

          "chunk_text": "## Customers\n\nOur  microprocessor  customers  consist  primarily  of  original  equipment  manufacturers  (OEMs),  large  public  cloud service  providers,  original  design  manufacturers  (ODMs),  system  integrators  and  independent  distributors  in  both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).\n\nCustomers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers' needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers' time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.\n\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\n\nTwo customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe  focus  on  three  types  of  OEM  partners:  multi-nationals,  selected  regional  accounts  and  some  local  system integrators,  who  target  commercial  and  consumer  end  customers  of  all  sizes.  Large  multi-nationals  and  regional accounts  are  the  core  of  our  OEM  partners'  business;  however,  we  are  increasingly  focused  on  the  Value  Added Reseller  (VAR)  channel  which  resells  OEM  systems  to  the  mid-market  and  the  small  and  medium  business  (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with  their  software  and  services  solutions  into  Enterprise,  HPC  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  Customers.  Our  OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors  handle  a  wide  variety  of  products,  and  may  include  those  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our  agreements  with  distributors  protect  their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements  with  our  distributors  may  contain  standard  stock  rotation  provisions  permitting  limited  levels  of  product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.",

      "question": "How did AMD's reliance on the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of its continued reference as a foundational governance document amid broader executive compensation plan disclosures?",
      "answer": "Across 2022, 2023, and 2024, AMD consistently referenced the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan as a foundational governance document, indicating no material changes or replacements during this period. In 2022, the plan was listed as *10.1* in the 10-K filing, reiterating its role alongside other executive compensation arrangements like the AMD Executive Severance Plan and the AMD Deferred Income Account Plan. In 2023, AMD again cited the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan as *10.1* in its 10-K filing, showing continuity in its disclosure practices. In 2024, the plan remained listed as *10.1* in the 10-K, reaffirming its ongoing relevance despite the presence of newer agreements and amendments to other plans. The consistent citation of the 2011 plan across all three years suggests AMD's executive incentive framework remained anchored in this policy without significant revision, even as other compensation mechanisms evolved.",

        "Hop 2: [AMD](2024) \u2192 [2011 Executive Incentive Plan]: In 2024, AMD again listed the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan as Exhibit *10.1*, showing no replacement or amendment to the plan within the latest filing.",

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to its international operations and third-party manufacturing dependencies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD highlighted intellectual property (IP) protection difficulties as part of its broader political and legal risks, noting that these challenges were compounded by global events like the pandemic and regulatory changes in data privacy such as the EU's GDPR and CCPA. In 2023, AMD reiterated these concerns, specifically emphasizing the impact of geopolitical tensions\u2014particularly between China and Taiwan\u2014on its third-party wafer foundries and manufacturing facilities, which could materially affect product delivery. In 2024, AMD continued to face similar IP protection difficulties, with international sales rising to 66% of net revenue, further exposing the company to regional legal and economic instability. The consistent mention of IP risks across all three years, combined with increasing international sales and geopolitical volatility, indicates a growing exposure and ongoing challenge in safeguarding IP across AMD\u2019s global supply chain.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AMD](2023) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD cited difficulties in protecting IP as part of its general risks, with specific concerns around geopolitical instability in China and Taiwan affecting third-party manufacturing and delivery.",
        "Hop 2: [AMD](2024) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD again highlighted IP protection difficulties, noting that international sales had increased to 66% of net revenue, amplifying exposure to legal and economic risks in foreign jurisdictions.",
        "Hop 3: [AMD](2022) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD identified IP protection challenges as part of its global legal and political risk profile, linking them to regulatory changes and disruptions from the pandemic, which impacted operations and supply chains."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Any impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe account for certain acquisitions, including the X ilinx, Inc. (X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.  The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.",

      "question": "How did Cisco's (CSCO) interest rate exposure on its 3.50% Senior Note evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's borrowing costs and capital market conditions over this period?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Cisco's 3.50% Senior Note carried an effective interest rate of 3.20%. By fiscal year 2023, this rate had increased to 6.38%, and in fiscal year 2024, it further rose to 6.66%. This represents a significant upward trend in Cisco's effective borrowing cost on this instrument, rising from 3.20% to 6.66% over the three-year period. This evolution reflects tightening capital market conditions and potentially higher perceived risk or changing interest rate environments during this time frame.",

In fiscal 2023, the company reported higher losses in these investments, which negatively impacted other income (loss), net. This negative trend continued in fiscal 2024, with the company again citing higher losses in available-for-sale debt investments as a primary driver of the change in other income (loss), net. The consistent mention of increasing losses across 2023 and 2024, following a more neutral disclosure in 2022, suggests growing volatility and deteriorating performance in this investment category over the three-year period.",

We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, orientation, ability, nationality and background - the foundation of our Conscious Culture.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performancebased compensation aligned with each employee's contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions.\n\nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signer of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and we are leading the charge to make fair pay a reality for all employees through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium. We have also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\n\n## Health &amp; Well-being\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We provide our employees and their families high-quality, flexible and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal lives, all while managing their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We developed a COVID-19 response and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health. In fiscal 2022, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We have moved towards a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe believe in open-ended, self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need to succeed. We encourage employees to explore assignments outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work. Employees choose their own career paths and we support that choice by providing them with tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nWe believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes regular, virtual all hands, which we refer to as a 'Cisco Check-In,' and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a 'Team Space Check-In.' Our regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cisco Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from business updates to social justice to physical and mental health.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we have seen high level of employee engagement. For example, there were approximately 2.1 million Team Space Check-Ins  by  our  employees  in  fiscal  2022,  reflecting  87%  of  employees  submitting  Team  Space  Check-Ins.  Employees  also participate  in  our  global  Engagement  Pulse  Survey  and  the  Real  Deal  Survey.  These  surveys  allow  our  employees  to  provide confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.\n\n## Purpose Report\n\nAdditional information regarding Cisco's ESG initiatives and our people, as well as our workforce diversity data, can be found in our Purpose Report and related supplemental information, which are located on our ESG Reporting Hub at https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en\\_us/about/csr/esg-hub.html.

The CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity - including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, ex perience, strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: As of July 27, 2024, 36% of our Ex ecutive Leadership Team (EL T) are women and 43% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity.\n\nWe publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2023 data, our global employee base was comprised of 29% women, 71% men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 48.2% White/Caucasian, 33.5% Asian, 6.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5.6% African American/Black, 2.0% two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino), 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 3.7% prefer to not to disclose/unknown.\n\nWith respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our positive impact. We have published our Social Justice Beliefs &amp; Actions, which is our blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background which is the foundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office helps drive accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and suppliers.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performance-based compensation aligned with each employee's contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions.\n\nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signatory of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org  pledge,  and  are  a  leader  in  the  charge  to  make  fair  pay  a  reality  for  all  employees  through  the  Employers  for  Pay  Equity  Consortium.  We  have  also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\n\nAs part of our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions, we have expanded our pay parity program beyond base salary to include additional forms of compensation fairness such as promotion, bonuses, and stock decisions made in our rewards programs. We aim to ensure the program addresses all employees across the full spectrum of diversity incorporating our global self-reported data collection.\n\n## Health &amp; Well-being\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We seek to provide our employees and their families with highquality, flex ible, and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. We strive to support our employees as they balance careers and personal lives, as well as their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other matters.\n\nWe host ongoing discussions with our employees during the Cisco Beat and Cisco Check-Ins, our regular company-wide virtual meetings, and continue to emphasize our Safe to Talk program. We offer mindfulness courses, employee assistance program offerings, and out-of-network provider benefits for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2024, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We employ a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe know careers are not static pathways that look the same for everyone. We also know that the world of work will continue to rapidly evolve, requiring new skillsets. At Cisco, we believe that your career is owned by you, supported by your leader, and enabled by Cisco. Cisco believes in open-ended self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows best what skills and resources they need to succeed. This means that while each employee has the power to shape their career on their own terms, they also have a supportive ecosystem to develop the skills they need to succeed both today and tomorrow. We strive to",

      "question": "How has Adobe's Photography Plan evolved from 2022 through 2024 in terms of positioning, feature integration, and AI capabilities, and what does this progression indicate about Adobe's strategy for attracting photographers and creative enthusiasts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe introduced the Photography Plan as a targeted package aimed at photographers and photo enthusiasts, positioning it as a more limited offering than Creative Cloud. By 2023, the Photography Plan was more clearly integrated into Adobe's broader AI-driven product-led growth strategy, with features like Generative Fill, Generative Expand, and AI-powered video tools from Photoshop and Premiere Pro enhancing its value. In 2024, the Photography Plan was explicitly tied to Adobe's AI innovation, including features like Generative Remove powered by Adobe Firefly, Lens Blur using AI depth mapping, and Denoise for RAW photo enhancement, reinforcing its role in Adobe\u2019s AI-infused creative workflow. This evolution shows Adobe\u2019s strategic shift from offering a basic photography suite to embedding advanced AI capabilities to deepen user engagement and differentiate the plan within its Creative Cloud ecosystem.",

Our  eLearning  solutions  and  web  conferencing  products  face  competition  from  a  number  of  established products from other large software companies. Competition involves a number of factors, including product features, ease-of-use, the level of customization and integration supported, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, their complementarity with our Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Digital Experience products and our strong brand among users.\n\n## PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n## Digital Media Offerings\n\n## Adobe Creative Cloud\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a cloud-based subscription to a collection of Apps that enables creative professionals and enthusiasts alike to express themselves and collaborate with Apps and services for photography, design, video, social media, and more that connect across surfaces, platforms and geographies. Subscribers have access to cloud storage to easily sync, access, collaborate and share their work, files and assets.\n\nCreative  Cloud  paid  plans  include  the  Adobe  Firefly  web  App,  the  premium  version  of  Adobe  Ex press,  and  AI-powered  features  natively  integrated throughout Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Premiere Pro. Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, and Adobe Express plans include a monthly allocation of Generative Credits, which are tokens that enable subscribers to use our generative AI features to generate content using text-based prompts. All Apps listed below and many more are available through subscriptions to Creative Cloud (except Substance 3D Apps, which are sold separately through the Adobe Substance 3D Collection plan), and many of our Apps are also available as standalone subscriptions on Adobe.com. Adobe Acrobat Pro is available as part of our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription and on a standalone basis and allows users to create, convert and edit PDFs, including text and images. Additionally, certain Creative Cloud Apps, such as Adobe Express, are available in Adobe G enStudio for Performance Marketing, allowing users to quickly use assets and Creative Cloud tools to create on-brand content.\n\n## Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom\n\nAdobe Photoshop is the world's most advanced digital imaging and design App, with powerful editing and effects tools to transform photos. It is available on desktop, iPad and through a web version.

Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Creative Cloud Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of business customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval purposes, copywriting or  leveraging  templates  for  social  media  marketing.  We  utilize  channel  partners  to  target  mid-size  creative  customers  with  our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption  of  our  Creative  Cloud  for  enterprise  offering.  Overall,  our  strategy  with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to increase  our  revenue  with  existing  users,  attract  new  customers  and  grow  a  recurring  and  predictable  revenue  stream  that  is recognized ratably.\n\nIn  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  we  expect  to  drive  sustained  long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web's functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat, integrate Adobe Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces, drive innovation with Adobe Sensei (machine-learning/AI) to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Sign APIs, and leverage diversified go-tomarket motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a datadriven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.\n\nAs our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features 'Liquid Mode' to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is also available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe  Sign  also  provides  a  green  alternative  to  costly,  paper-based  solutions  and  offers  a  modern,  convenient  solution  for customers  to  digitally  manage  their  documents,  automate  processes  and  contract  workflows.  We  believe  that  by  growing  the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\n## Opportunity\n\nDigital  transformation  is  a  macro  trend  that  affects  every  business,  government  and  educational  institution  today-every business  is  a  digital  business.  Consumers  today  buy  experiences,  not  just  products,  and  they  demand  personalized  digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, which drives business-to-business ('B2B') companies to deliver business-toconsumer ('B2C') experiences with a 'business-to-everyone' ('B2E') strategy. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world's leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.\n\nAdobe  Experience  Cloud  is  powering  digital  businesses  by  providing  exceptional  experiences  to  their  customers  via  a comprehensive suite of solutions. We continue to believe that addressing the challenges of customer experience management is",

In this era of connected creativity, we envision Creative Cloud functioning as a creative system, keeping our users connected to everything and everyone they need to make a project successful. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow by expanding content-first, task-based creativity, advancing every creative category across desktop, web and mobile, expanding 3D and immersive content creation, enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders and inspiring and empowering the creative community through sharing and monetization.\n\nAdobe's  Digital  Media  segment  also  includes  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  a  unified,  cloud-based  document services platform, which integrates Adobe's pioneering PDF technology with our Acrobat and Adobe Sign applications to deliver fully digital document workflows. Digital documents have a mission-critical role in powering modern businesses with hundreds of millions  of  communicators  worldwide  interacting  with  documents  every  day.  With  this  digital  transformation,  we  have  the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. In our Adobe Document Cloud business, Adobe Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption and a leadership  position  in  document-intensive  industries  such  as  government,  financial  services,  pharmaceutical,  legal,  aerospace, insurance and technical publishing. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy, and there are hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document services platform found in Document Cloud.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer  a  range  of  products  and  services  that  allow  individuals,  teams,  small  and  medium  businesses,  enterprises  and  government institutions,  including  both  professionals  and  enthusiasts,  to  design  and  deliver  content  seamlessly.  With  content  creation, consumption and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth through innovation to make our creative applications more accessible and easier to learn and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.\n\nWe continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering content-first, task-based creativity with our launch of Creative Cloud Express, a web and mobile application with a content- and template-first experience to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily, in December 2021. We aim to continue to advance every creative category across desktop, web and mobile. We have delivered our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom, on desktop and mobile devices to allow users the ability to work from anywhere on any device and to collaborate with stakeholders. We are building collaboration deeply into our applications and workflows to enable seamless collaboration across stakeholders. We are taking Creative Cloud to the web, beginning with a public beta version of Photoshop, which will allow Creative Cloud subscribers to make edits to and collaborate on their files directly in their browser. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications. We continue to introduce new features and solutions in our products, such as auto-masking and new and improved neural filters in Photoshop, auto-captioning in Premiere, adjustment layers and perspective grids in Adobe Fresco and additional motion features in Adobe  XD. We  are  pursuing  new  ways  to  inspire,  empower  and  connect  the  creative  community,  such  as  through  our  Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range  of  other  creative  tools  and  services,  including  hobbyist  products,  such  as  Photoshop  Elements  and  Premiere  Elements; libraries  of  creative  assets,  such  as Adobe  Stock  and Adobe  Fonts;  mobile-first  apps,  such  as  Photoshop  Camera;  and  Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under 'Principal Products and Services.'\n\nOn October 7, 2021, Adobe acquired Frame.io and began integrating its leading cloud-based video collaboration platform into  Adobe  Creative  Cloud.  With  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  we  aim  to  make  the  creative  process  even  more  collaborative, productive  and  efficient  by  enhancing  Adobe  Creative  Cloud  with  Frame.io's  cloud-native  collaboration  workflows,  while continuing  to  enable  third-party  applications.  As  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  we  are  more  deeply  integrating  and  enhancing Frame.io's review and approval capabilities in Premiere Pro and After Effects to deliver a native collaborative platform for video editing.\n\nIn our Creative Cloud business, we continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to move our customers to bettervalue offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. As part of our strategy, we use a data-driven operating model and our Digital Experience solutions offered through Adobe",

Our training portfolio includes a large number of free online self-service learning options on learning.adobe.com. Adobe Digital Learning Services also has an extensive portfolio of fee-based learning programs including a wide range of traditional classroom, virtual and on-demand training and certifications delivered by our team of training professionals and partners across the globe.\n\nThese core offerings are complemented by our custom learning services, which support our largest enterprise customers and their unique requirements. Solution-specific skills assessments help our enterprise customers objectively assess the knowledge and competencies within their marketing teams and tailor their learning priorities accordingly.\n\n## Investments\n\nFrom time to time, we make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  technological  developments  in  the  industry  and  ex pand  our  opportunities  to  provide Adobe products, services, and solutions.\n\n## RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT\n\nWith the speed of innovation and technological change that characterizes the software industry, a continuous high level of investment is required for the research and development of the cutting-edge technologies that lead to the development of new products, services and solutions and the continual enhancement of existing products, services and solutions. Our Adobe Research team of research scientists, engineers, artists and designers help turn ideas into technologies that power the future of our products, services and solutions. We are investing, and intend to continue to invest, in research and development to strengthen our existing products, services and solutions, and to expand our offerings across our clouds and the next generation of AI, machine learning and deep learning-driven tools and features to solve problems in areas such as content understanding and generation, recommendations, personalization and more.\n\nIn addition to our own research and development, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe  protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign  intellectual  property  laws, confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and  pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile Apps to users and customers under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  and  customers  under  'click  through'  or  signed  agreements containing  restrictions  on  access  and  use.  Our  enterprise  customers  license  our  hosted  offerings  as  SaaS  or  Managed  Services  via  agreements  based  on  our enterprise licensing terms.\n\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop Apps with the same functionality as our Apps. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.",

      "question": "How did Adobe's strategic positioning and feature integration of Adobe Document Cloud evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its integration with AI-powered tools like Adobe Firefly and its role in driving business productivity?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe Document Cloud was positioned primarily as a document and forms platform within Adobe's broader Publishing and Advertising segment, indicating a more foundational role in enterprise workflows. By 2023, Adobe elevated Document Cloud as a core component of its Digital Media segment, emphasizing its role in transforming how users view, share, and collaborate on documents. In 2024, Adobe further enhanced Document Cloud by integrating it with AI innovations like Adobe Firefly, which introduced generative AI features for document workflows, and expanded its enterprise capabilities through Firefly Services and Custom Models. This evolution shows a clear trajectory from a utility-focused platform to a more intelligent, AI-driven productivity suite that aligns with Adobe's broader vision for digital transformation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Frame.io was listed among Adobe's trademarks, indicating its strategic importance as a brand within the Adobe ecosystem. By 2023, Adobe had positioned Frame.io as a core part of its creative collaboration offerings, describing it as a 'cloud-native creative collaboration platform' integrated with Premiere Pro and After Effects, supporting real-time upload, review, and approval with frame-accurate commenting. In 2024, Adobe expanded Frame.io\u2019s capabilities beyond post-production into broader video workflows such as casting, location scouting, and marketing campaign management, and integrated it with additional apps like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Workfront. This evolution shows Adobe's deepening investment in end-to-end creative collaboration tools, with Frame.io becoming a central hub for multi-app, cross-functional workflows at scale.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's 2.000% Notes were referenced consistently across 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, showing a stable inclusion within the company's long-term debt structure under the same indenture framework. In 2022, the 2.000% Notes were listed under the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, with a maturity of 2023. By 2023, the same note was still referenced under identical documentation, indicating no structural changes. In 2024, the 2.000% Notes due 2023 were still present in the exhibit list, suggesting that while the maturity date had passed, the documentation remained part of the company's historical indentures. This shows a consistent debt instrument with no modifications across the three years.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of debt instruments related to the 4.000% Notes due 2021 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this pattern indicate about the company's long-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 4.000% Notes due 2021 across all three fiscal years (2022, 2023, and 2024) as part of its broader debt structure under the Indenture dated May 18, 2009. In 2022, the Third Supplemental Indenture was listed as Exhibit 4.6 in the 10-K filing, reaffirming the company\u2019s ongoing obligations tied to this note. In 2023, the same instrument was again referenced under the same exhibit number and description, indicating no structural changes. By 2024, despite the note being past its maturity date, Microsoft continued to disclose the 4.000% Notes due 2021 in its exhibit list, suggesting either a delayed settlement, rollover, or ongoing disclosure requirement. This pattern indicates a consistent and transparent approach to debt disclosure, even post-maturity, and suggests disciplined long-term debt management.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of long-term debt instruments, specifically the 3.950% Notes due 2056, evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about the company's long-term capital strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 3.950% Notes due 2056 in its filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating ongoing commitment to this long-term debt instrument. The repeated inclusion of the August 8, 2016-dated Eleventh Supplemental Indenture across all three years shows that the structure and terms of the Notes due 2056 remained unchanged, suggesting a stable, long-duration capital planning approach. This consistency implies Microsoft views long-term fixed-rate debt as a strategic component of its capital structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [3.950% Notes due 2056]: Microsoft included the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, in its 2023 10-K filing, confirming continued reference to this long-term debt instrument.",
        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [3.950% Notes due 2056]: In the 2024 10-K, Microsoft again listed the 3.950% Notes due 2056 under the same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, showing no structural or issuance changes.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2022) \u2192 [3.950% Notes due 2056]: The 2022 10-K also included the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture from August 8, 2016, confirming that the Notes due 2056 were part of Microsoft's capital structure and disclosure framework well before 2023 and 2024."

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of the 2.125% Notes evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of maturity dates and associated supplemental indentures?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's 2.125% Notes were consistently referenced across all three years, with the maturity date remaining fixed at 2021. However, the supplemental indentures associated with these notes evolved over time, reflecting ongoing legal documentation updates. In 2022, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture was listed under Exhibit 4.10, dated December 6, 2013. In 2023, the same indenture was referenced under Exhibit 4.1, maintaining the same date and maturity structure. In 2024, the exhibit number remained 4.1 but was now described as part of a broader set of indentures including the 3.125% Notes due 2028, suggesting a consolidation or reclassification of documentation. Despite the maturity date predating all three reporting years, the continued presence of these notes in disclosures indicates ongoing relevance in Microsoft's debt structure.",

      "answer": "Cisco's effective interest rate on the 3.50% June 15, 2025 maturity note increased from 3.20% in fiscal year 2022 to 6.38% in fiscal year 2023, and further rose to 6.66% in fiscal year 2024.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco disclosed the existence of its AFS debt investments through summarized tables, but no specific performance metrics were provided for that year, indicating no immediate material impact on financial results. In fiscal 2023, the company reported that higher losses in AFS debt investments were a primary driver of a decline in 'other income (loss), net,' signaling a material negative impact. This trend continued in fiscal 2024, where AFS debt investment losses again significantly contributed to a lower 'other income (loss), net' result, despite partial offsets from gains in equity investments. The consistent negative impact in 2023 and 2024, combined with the lack of performance data in 2022, reveals a growing financial risk associated with these investments over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur  Inclusive  Future Action  Office  is  focused  on  driving  impacts  through  our  strategic  actions  in  the African American/Black community, and these actions will be the blueprint for how we help address inequity in communities around the world in the future. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, orientation, ability, nationality and background - the foundation of our Conscious Culture.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performancebased compensation aligned with each employee's contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions.\n\nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signer of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and we are leading the charge to make fair pay a reality for all employees through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium. We have also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\n\n## Health &amp; Well-being\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We provide our employees and their families high-quality, flexible and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal lives, all while managing their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We developed a COVID-19 response and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health. In fiscal 2022, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We have moved towards a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe believe in open-ended, self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need to succeed. We encourage employees to explore assignments outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work. Employees choose their own career paths and we support that choice by providing them with tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nWe believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes regular, virtual all hands, which we refer to as a 'Cisco Check-In,' and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a 'Team Space Check-In.' Our regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cisco Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from business updates to social justice to physical and mental health.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we have seen high level of employee engagement. For example, there were approximately 2.1 million Team Space Check-Ins  by  our  employees  in  fiscal  2022,  reflecting  87%  of  employees  submitting  Team  Space  Check-Ins.  Employees  also participate  in  our  global  Engagement  Pulse  Survey  and  the  Real  Deal  Survey.  These  surveys  allow  our  employees  to  provide confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.\n\n## Purpose Report\n\nAdditional information regarding Cisco's ESG initiatives and our people, as well as our workforce diversity data, can be found in our Purpose Report and related supplemental information, which are located on our ESG Reporting Hub at https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en\\_us/about/csr/esg-hub.html.

The CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity - including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, ex perience, strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: As of July 27, 2024, 36% of our Ex ecutive Leadership Team (EL T) are women and 43% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity.\n\nWe publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2023 data, our global employee base was comprised of 29% women, 71% men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 48.2% White/Caucasian, 33.5% Asian, 6.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5.6% African American/Black, 2.0% two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino), 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 3.7% prefer to not to disclose/unknown.\n\nWith respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our positive impact. We have published our Social Justice Beliefs &amp; Actions, which is our blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background which is the foundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office helps drive accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and suppliers.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performance-based compensation aligned with each employee's contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions.\n\nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signatory of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org  pledge,  and  are  a  leader  in  the  charge  to  make  fair  pay  a  reality  for  all  employees  through  the  Employers  for  Pay  Equity  Consortium.  We  have  also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\n\nAs part of our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions, we have expanded our pay parity program beyond base salary to include additional forms of compensation fairness such as promotion, bonuses, and stock decisions made in our rewards programs. We aim to ensure the program addresses all employees across the full spectrum of diversity incorporating our global self-reported data collection.\n\n## Health &amp; Well-being\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We seek to provide our employees and their families with highquality, flex ible, and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. We strive to support our employees as they balance careers and personal lives, as well as their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other matters.\n\nWe host ongoing discussions with our employees during the Cisco Beat and Cisco Check-Ins, our regular company-wide virtual meetings, and continue to emphasize our Safe to Talk program. We offer mindfulness courses, employee assistance program offerings, and out-of-network provider benefits for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2024, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We employ a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe know careers are not static pathways that look the same for everyone. We also know that the world of work will continue to rapidly evolve, requiring new skillsets. At Cisco, we believe that your career is owned by you, supported by your leader, and enabled by Cisco. Cisco believes in open-ended self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows best what skills and resources they need to succeed. This means that while each employee has the power to shape their career on their own terms, they also have a supportive ecosystem to develop the skills they need to succeed both today and tomorrow.

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's valuation and treatment of its 3.50% Notes Due 2040 evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression reveal about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, NVIDIA reported the fair value of its 3.50% Notes Due 2040 at $1,066 million. By fiscal 2023, this value had decreased slightly to $851 million. In fiscal 2024, the company no longer reported a fair value but instead listed a carrying amount of $1,000 million for the long-term portion of these notes. This evolution suggests a shift in how NVIDIA accounts for and manages its long-term debt obligations, potentially reflecting a more stable and strategic approach to long-term financing.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA(2022) \u2192 3.50% Notes Due 2040: Fair value reported at $1,066 million in 2022, indicating active market valuation.",
        "Hop 2: NVDA(2023) \u2192 3.50% Notes Due 2040: Fair value dropped to $851 million, suggesting potential market revaluation or strategic repurchase.",
        "Hop 3: NVDA(2024) \u2192 3.50% Notes Due 2040: Carrying amount of $1,000 million listed, showing a shift from fair value to amortized cost basis, indicating long-term commitment."

      "answer": "NVIDIA's liability for the 3.50% Notes Due 2050 decreased from $2,147 million in fiscal 2022 to $1,604 million in fiscal 2024, with a midpoint value of $1,637 million in fiscal 2023.

      "answer": "NVIDIA's exposure to the 1.55% Notes Due 2028 was $1.2 billion in 2022, remained relatively stable at $1.1 billion in 2023, and then increased to $1.25 billion in 2024. This indicates a consistent long-term debt position in this instrument over the three-year period, with a slight increase in 2024 after a minor reduction in 2023, suggesting a strategic maintenance of this liability as part of its capital structure.",

      "question": "What does the trend in NVIDIA's liability for the 2.00% Notes Due 2031 from fiscal years 2022 to 2024 suggest about the company's long-term debt management strategy, particularly in light of the $1.2 billion carrying amount in 2022, the slight reduction to $1.044 billion in 2023, and the return to $1.25 billion in 2024?",
      "answer": "The liability for NVIDIA's 2.00% Notes Due 2031 remained relatively stable across the three years, indicating a consistent long-term debt strategy. In 2022, the liability was reported at $1.2 billion. It slightly decreased to $1.044 billion in 2023, possibly reflecting minor debt repayments or reclassifications. However, by 2024, the carrying amount returned to $1.25 billion, suggesting that NVIDIA maintained its long-term capital structure and did not materially alter its exposure to this long-dated debt instrument. This pattern implies a strategic intent to preserve stable long-term liabilities, likely to support ongoing R&D and operational investments without significant refinancing risk.",

        "Hop 3: NVDA(2024) \u2192 2.00% Notes Due 2031: Liability returns to $1.25 billion, showing a reversion to prior levels and consistent long-term debt posture."

      "question": "How has the competitive positioning of Lumentum Holdings in NVIDIA's networking product ecosystem evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression suggest about NVIDIA's strategic response to competitive pressures in high-performance interconnect technologies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lumentum Holdings remained consistently listed among NVIDIA's key competitors in the networking product space, specifically in the domain of switches, network adapters, and optical modules. In 2022, Lumentum Holdings was included in a list of companies such as AMD, Broadcom, Cisco, and others competing in interconnect, switch, and cable solutions. In 2023, NVIDIA emphasized an increasingly competitive landscape and again named Lumentum Holdings as part of a similar grouping, while also noting the growing influence of internal teams within large cloud services companies. By 2024, Lumentum Holdings was still explicitly named as a competitor, with NVIDIA expanding its discussion around supply chain resilience and manufacturing capacity, likely in response to the persistent and intensifying competition. This 3-year consistency in naming Lumentum Holdings suggests that NVIDIA views it as a stable and significant competitor in high-performance interconnect technologies, prompting NVIDIA to focus on scaling production and securing supply chains to maintain its market position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NVDA(2022) \u2192 Lumentum Holdings: Lumentum is listed among competitors in interconnect, switch, and cable solutions, indicating early recognition of its role in the networking space.",
        "Hop 2: NVDA(2023) \u2192 Lumentum Holdings: Lumentum is again named in the list of networking competitors, with NVIDIA emphasizing rising competition and potential alliances among rivals.",
        "Hop 3: NVDA(2024) \u2192 Lumentum Holdings: Lumentum is explicitly named once more, with NVIDIA discussing expanded supplier relationships and supply chain resilience, suggesting strategic adaptation to sustained competitive pressure."

We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers  and  licensors  designing  discrete  and  integrated  GPUs,  custom  chips  and  other  accelerated computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\n- suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc.,  AMD,  Broadcom  Inc., Intel, Qualcomm  Incorporated, Renesas  Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\n- suppliers  of  interconnect,  switch  and  cable  solutions  such  as  AMD,  Applied  Optoelectronics,  Inc.,  Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe  rely  primarily  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  employee  and  third-party  nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;\n- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n- the  commercial  significance  of  our  operations  and  our  competitors'  operations  in  particular  countries  and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for a discussion of these potential impacts.",

Our  supply  chain  is  mainly  concentrated  in  the  A sia-Pacific  region.  We  utilize  foundries,  such  as  T aiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSM C, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix Inc., M icron T echnology , Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly , testing and packaging of our final products.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,  conformity  to  industry  standard A PIs,  manufacturing  capabilities,  processor  pricing,  and  total  system  costs.  W e  believe  that  our  ability   to  remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver  consistent  volumes  of  our  products  at  acceptable  levels  of  quality   and  at  competitiv e  prices.  W e  ex pect  competition  to  increase  from  both  ex isting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\n\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for A I, such as A dv anced M icro Devices, Inc., or A M D, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or A I computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as A libaba Group, A lphabet Inc., A mazon, Inc., or A mazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and M icrosoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\n- suppliers of A rm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and M icrosoft;\n- suppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as A mbarella, Inc., A M D, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\n- networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical modules) include such as A M D, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company , Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and M arvell T echnology , Inc. as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally . Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP . The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in A sia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely . We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Texas Instruments consistently emphasized embedded processing products as a core component of its business model, underscoring their role in delivering long-term free cash flow per share growth. In 2022, the company highlighted embedded processing as one of two key product lines (alongside analog) that anchor its four sustainable competitive advantages. This focus persisted in 2023, with the company reiterating that embedded processing products provide 'more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.' In 2024, Texas Instruments maintained this strategic narrative, describing embedded processing as central to its competitive model that enables supply chain control, customer reach, and diversified returns. The consistent emphasis across all three years indicates that embedded processing is not a tactical shift but a foundational pillar in TI's long-term cash flow generation strategy.",

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.\n\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:\n- i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n- ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.\n- iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n- iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.\n\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares and 7 million shares valued at $1.16 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in both 2021 and 2020 were $27 million.

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching sav ings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to v arious inv estment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are prov ided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after Nov ember 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan prov ides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receiv e the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 5 million shares in both periods v alued at $852 million and $873 million, respectiv ely. Div idends paid on these shares in 2024 and 2023 were $26 million and $27 million, respectiv ely. Effectiv e April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $76 million, $75 million and $70 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue serv ice-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of serv ice and the highest fiv e consecutiv e years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants.",

There was no expansion into Embedded Processing in Melaka during this period, despite changes in other global locations.

This consistent reduction indicates that Texas Instruments has been actively utilizing the 2003 Director Compensation Plan to issue shares for director compensation over the three-year period, with fewer shares remaining available for future grants each year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PC & notebooks were listed as a key component of the personal electronics segment, which accounted for 24% of TI's revenue. By 2023, the personal electronics segment declined to 15% of TI's revenue, yet PC & notebooks remained a highlighted product category within that segment. In 2024, the personal electronics segment rebounded to 20% of TI's revenue, with PC & notebooks continuing to be a named priority alongside mobile phones and portable electronics. Despite the segment\u2019s volatility (24% \u2192 15% \u2192 20%), PC & notebooks remained consistently mentioned, suggesting that TI maintained its strategic focus on consumer computing even during periods of reduced segment size. This implies a deliberate effort to preserve market presence in PC-related semiconductor applications despite broader shifts in revenue allocation.",

      "question": "How did ACN's target asset allocation strategy for its defined benefit pension plans evolve from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, and what does this multi-year shift suggest about the company's long-term investment risk tolerance?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, ACN set target allocations for the following year (fiscal 2024), indicating a strategy that emphasized flexibility around target asset allocations based on market conditions and cash flow needs. By fiscal 2024, the company extended its target allocation planning horizon to fiscal 2025, maintaining similar language around flexibility but continuing to emphasize risk-adjusted returns aligned with long-term investment strategies. The consistent focus on matching debt security durations to liabilities and diversifying equities suggests a measured, stable approach to risk. However, the forward-looking extension of target planning from one year (2023 \u2192 2024) to two years (2024 \u2192 2025) indicates increased confidence in long-term market outlook and a potentially more strategic, less reactive asset allocation stance.",

        "Hop 1: [ACN](2022) \u2192 [Asset Allocation Decisions]: In fiscal 2022, ACN established target asset allocations for fiscal 2023, emphasizing flexibility based on market conditions and investment committee decisions, with a focus on risk-adjusted returns and liability duration matching.",
        "Hop 2: [ACN](2023) \u2192 [Asset Allocation Decisions]: In fiscal 2023, ACN updated its target allocation planning to cover fiscal 2025, maintaining similar flexibility and risk management principles but extending strategic planning horizons.",
        "Hop 3: [ACN](2024) \u2192 [Asset Allocation Decisions]: In fiscal 2024, ACN reaffirmed its commitment to long-term investment strategies, continuing to align asset allocation with liability durations and maintaining diversified equity exposure, while still allowing for market-driven deviations from targets."

Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.\n\n## Non-U.S. Pension Plans\n\nPlan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation. The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers. In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with us. Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan. Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy. Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nPlan investments are exposed to risks including market, interest rate and operating risk. In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities. To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities. Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation. Plan asset allocation and investment managers' guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nOur target allocation for fiscal 2023 and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of August 31, 2022 and 2021 by asset category for defined benefit pension plans are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Accenture had an aggregate available authorization of $3,129,296,000 for share purchases and redemptions. By fiscal 2023, the company had spent part of this authorization, and as of August 31, 2024, the remaining available authorization stood at $2,694 million, before receiving an additional $4,000 million in new repurchase authority, bringing the total outstanding authority to $6,694 million. This indicates a consistent and increasing commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, with a notable increase in total authorized funds by fiscal 2024, despite a reduction in remaining available funds prior to the new authorization.",

Each ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc; however a holder of an ordinary share is not entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc or to receive dividends.\n\n## Class A Ordinary Shares\n\nAn Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc's Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.\n\n## Class X Ordinary Shares\n\nMost of our pre-incorporation partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. An Accenture plc Class X ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A Class X ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.\n\n## Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares\n\n## Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares\n\nPre-incorporation partners resident in Canada and New Zealand received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. We may, at our option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. As of August 31, 2022, our aggregate available authorization was $3,129,296 for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs.",

      "question": "How has Accenture's approach to developing new pricing models evolved from 2022 to 2024 in response to technological developments in cloud, data, and AI, and what does this progression indicate about their strategic adaptation to industry shifts?",
      "answer": "Accenture's approach to pricing models evolved significantly from 2022 to 2024 in response to technological developments. In 2022, the company acknowledged the need to 'introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments' due to the impact of cloud and as-a-service solutions on revenue generation. By 2023, Accenture expanded its strategy by emphasizing 'driving innovation and making strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies' to respond to technological changes and industry developments. In 2024, the company demonstrated deeper dependence on these new models, highlighting risks related to their implementation and expressing concern about whether 'the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.' This progression indicates a strategic shift from merely acknowledging the need for change to actively implementing and relying on new commercial models as a core part of their growth strategy in response to AI, cloud, and data advancements.",

          "chunk_text": "Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud and as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead",

When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of rev enues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties related to the development and use of A I could harm our business, damage our reputation or give rise to legal or regulatory action.\n\nWe are increasingly applying A I-based technologies, including generative A I, to our services and solutions, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

In fiscal 2022, the company had $3.13 billion in aggregate available authorization for share purchases.

As of August 31, 2024, the available authorization stood at $2.69 billion, but this was subsequently increased by an additional $4 billion on September 25, 2024, bringing total outstanding authority to $6.69 billion.

Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc's Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.\n\n## Class X Ordinary Shares\n\nMost of our pre-incorporation partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares.

Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding.

Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. We may, at our option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange.

      "answer": "In 2022, Accenture acknowledged the need to introduce new pricing models in response to technological developments such as cloud and as-a-service solutions, warning that failure to do so could negatively impact results of operations. By 2023, the company expanded this narrative to include AI and data solutions, emphasizing that delays in client spending were occurring as they evaluated new technologies, and that Accenture needed to respond with pricing models that reflect the value of these innovations. In 2024, the language remained consistent, but the emphasis on AI intensified, with the company noting that generative AI and internal AI deployment were central to its service offerings and that the development of commercial models was now a dependency for maintaining leadership and realizing returns on AI investments. This evolution shows that Accenture's pricing strategy has transformed from a reactive response to cloud in 2022, to a broader digital transformation focus in 2023, and finally to a strategic dependency on AI-driven pricing innovation by 2024.",

A s we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.\n\nTechnological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud, data and A I solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced, in whole or in part, some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation and making strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies to our current offerings that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions have had and could in the future have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our managed services contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. M any of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. A dditionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of rev enues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties related to the development and use of A I could harm our business, damage our reputation or give rise to legal or regulatory action.\n\nWe are increasingly applying A I-based technologies, including generative A I, to our services and solutions, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",

We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead",

      "question": "How did IBM's emphasis on client relationships and trust as a competitive differentiator evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression reveal about its hybrid cloud and AI strategy positioning?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM highlighted client relationships and trust as one of its principal methods of competition, alongside technology innovation and performance, indicating its foundational role in differentiating the company. By 2023, IBM reinforced this emphasis by explicitly linking client relationships and trust to its ability to deliver business value and solve complex client challenges through integrated technologies. In 2024, the company maintained this positioning but expanded the context by showcasing strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and global system integrators, suggesting that trust and relationships were being extended through ecosystem collaboration to enhance client outcomes. This evolution shows a consistent strategic focus on trust as a core asset, increasingly leveraged through partnerships and hybrid cloud/AI capabilities to drive client-centric innovation.",

Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new competitors.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nOur breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong focus on innovation. All of these attributes position IBM for accelerated growth now and prepare us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed the 1.250% Notes due 2027 as part of its exhibit list, referencing the instrument defining the rights of the holders filed on January 30, 2019. By 2023, IBM continued to reference the 1.250% Notes due 2027, specifically noting their inclusion in filings from February 8, 2022, and February 3, 2023. In 2024, IBM formally listed the 1.250% Notes due 2027 (trading symbol IBM27B) as an issued financial instrument on the New York Stock Exchange, indicating a shift from disclosure to active market presence. This progression shows a clear transition from internal documentation and reference to public issuance and trading.",

      "answer": "Across the 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, IBM consistently referenced the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 as Exhibit 2 to Form 8-K filed on January 8, 1998. However, in 2022, the debenture was listed among several short-term notes (e.g., 1.250% Notes due 2023, 2.625% Notes due 2022), suggesting a focus on near-term obligations. By 2023 and 2024, the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 appeared alongside longer-dated instruments like the 5.875% Debentures due 2032 and 6.22% Debentures due 2027, indicating a shift toward emphasizing longer-term liabilities. This evolution suggests a potential realignment in IBM\u2019s capital structure focus from short-term to long-term debt obligations over the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did IBM's treatment and disclosure of its 0.950% Notes due 2025 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's capital structure strategy and transparency over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed the 0.950% Notes due 2025 as part of its long-term debt instruments, referencing the defining instrument incorporated by reference from a May 2017 Form 8-K filing. By 2023, IBM continued to disclose the 0.950% Notes due 2025 in its 10-K filing, reaffirming the rights of holders and referencing the same May 2017 filing, indicating ongoing recognition of the instrument's structure and terms. In 2024, IBM listed the 0.950% Notes due 2025 on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker IBM25B, signaling a shift from mere disclosure to active market visibility and tradability. This evolution suggests that IBM transitioned the 0.950% Notes due 2025 from a less prominent debt instrument to a publicly traded security, reflecting a broader capital structure strategy emphasizing liquidity and transparency in its fixed-income offerings.",

      "question": "How did IBM's disclosures about the impact of stock exchange regulations on its debt and equity securities evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about its increasing sensitivity to regulatory changes affecting capital markets liquidity?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM highlighted that the value of its debt and equity securities was subject to fluctuations due to 'governmental and stock exchange regulations,' alongside other external factors like interest rates and geopolitical conditions. By 2023, the company reiterated this sensitivity but placed additional emphasis on the interplay between regulatory changes and liquidity risk, particularly in the context of the Kyndryl spin-off, which required strict adherence to IRS rulings and representations that could be jeopardized by regulatory non-compliance. In 2024, IBM expanded on this risk by directly linking stock exchange regulations to broader financial market conditions, noting that volatility and liquidity constraints could not only impact the valuation of its securities but also affect its financial flexibility through pension funding obligations and client credit risk. This evolution shows a growing awareness and explicit linkage between regulatory environments and IBM's capital structure stability, with increasing emphasis on liquidity risk and the potential for regulatory disruptions in global markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [IBM](2022) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: IBM noted that the value of its debt and equity securities was influenced by 'governmental and stock exchange regulations' among other external factors, indicating a foundational awareness of regulatory risk.",
        "Hop 2: [IBM](2023) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: The company emphasized regulatory compliance in the context of the Kyndryl spin-off, where incorrect representations or regulatory changes could jeopardize tax-free status, showing a more specific regulatory exposure.",
        "Hop 3: [IBM](2024) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: IBM explicitly linked stock exchange regulations to liquidity risk, pension funding volatility, and client creditworthiness, signaling a more integrated and systemic view of regulatory impact on capital markets access."

The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities\n\nThe Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.",

      "question": "How did AMD's revenue recognition methodology for development and intellectual property (IP) licensing agreements evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this consistency or change imply about the company's long-term strategic approach to IP monetization?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD maintained a consistent revenue recognition methodology for development and IP licensing agreements. In all three years, the company evaluated whether the licensing component was distinct\u2014both capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license was not distinct, it was combined with development services and recognized over time; if distinct, revenue was recognized at a point in time when the customer could benefit from the license. Additionally, AMD consistently stated that there were no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined or standalone IP arrangements. This three-year consistency suggests a stable and deliberate strategic approach to IP monetization, with no material changes in how AMD structures or accounts for these agreements, indicating a mature and well-defined policy framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## Custom products\n\nCustom products which are associated with the Company's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semicustom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company's satisfaction of its performance obligation.\n\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n## Development and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  the  Company  may  enter  into  arrangements  with  customers  that  combine  the  provision  of development services and a license to the right to use the Company's IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or  multiple  performance  obligations  based  upon  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  Revenue  is  recognized  upon  the transfer  of  control,  over  time  or  at  a  point  in  time,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  The  Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct  and  (ii)  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  arrangement.  If  the  license  is  not  distinct,  it  is  combined  with  the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its  patents  or  IP .  Generally,  there  are  no  performance  obligations  beyond  transferring  the  designated  license  to  the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company's standard contractual terms, which  are  typically  net  30  to  60  days.  The  Company  has  determined  that  it  does  not  have  significant  financing components in its contracts with customers.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions  about future demand  and  market  conditions. In determining excess  or obsolescence  reserves  for  its  products,  the  Company  considers  assumptions  such  as  changes  in  business  and economic  conditions,  other-than-temporary  decreases  in  demand  for  its  products,  and  changes  in  technology  or customer  requirements.  In  determining  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value  reserves,  the  Company  considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company  fully  reserves  for  inventories  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  for  inventory  deemed  obsolete.  The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  to  anticipated  usage  using  recent  historical  activity  as  well  as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.",

Where funds prov ided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to rev enue at the time the related rev enue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to rev enue at the later of when: i) the related rev enue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to perform specific product adv ertising  or  marketing  and  promotional  activ ities,  such  amounts  are  recognized  as  a  reduction  to  rev enue  unless  they  qualify  for  expense recognition.\n\nConstraints of v ariable consideration hav e not been material.\n\n## Custom products\n\nCustom products, which are primarily associated with the Company's Gaming segment, are sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which hav e no alternativ e use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as rev enue, ov er the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of rev enue to recognize for in-process or completed customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believ es that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company's satisfaction of its performance obligation.\n\nSales of custom products are not subject to a right of return and arrangements generally inv olv e a single performance obligation. Generally, there are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n## Development and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the prov ision of dev elopment serv ices and a license to the right  to  use  the  Company's  IP.  T hese  arrangements  are  deemed  to  be  single  or  multiple  performance  obligations  based  upon  the  nature  of  the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, ov er time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the dev elopment serv ices as a single performance obligation and recognized ov er time. If the license is distinct, rev enue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely inv olv e the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, rev enue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nThere  are  no  v ariable  consideration  estimates  associated  with  either  combined  dev elopment  and  IP  arrangements  or  for  standalone  arrangements inv olv ing either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable v alue using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserv es for its products, the  Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary  decreases  in  demand  for  its  products,  and  changes  in  technology  or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable v alue reserv es, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activ ity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. T he Company fully reserv es for inv entories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inv entory deemed obsolete. T he Company performs periodic rev iews of inv entory items to identify excess inv entories on hand by comparing onhand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activ ity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less fav orable than those projected by the Company, additional inv entory carrying v alue adjustments may be required.",

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to the risk of losing tax and tariff exemptions evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the increasing complexity of its global regulatory environment?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD consistently highlighted the risk of losing or having modified tax and tariff exemptions as a key concern in its global operations. In 2022, this risk was listed among other geopolitical and economic risks, indicating a general awareness of its potential impact. By 2023, AMD expanded its discussion to include the effects of specific geopolitical events, such as the conflict in Ukraine and tensions between China and Taiwan, which heightened the likelihood of regulatory shifts affecting exemptions. In 2024, the company reiterated this risk in the context of broader macroeconomic and political instability, including the expansion of U.S. export controls and sanctions, suggesting that the regulatory landscape had become more volatile and complex. This progression indicates that AMD's exposure to the risk of losing tax and tariff exemptions has increased over time, driven by both internal expansion and external geopolitical pressures.",

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Customers\n\nOur  microprocessor  customers  consist  primarily  of  original  equipment  manufacturers  (OEMs),  large  public  cloud service  providers,  original  design  manufacturers  (ODMs),  system  integrators  and  independent  distributors  in  both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).\n\nCustomers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers' needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers' time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.\n\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\n\nTwo customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe  focus  on  three  types  of  OEM  partners:  multi-nationals,  selected  regional  accounts  and  some  local  system integrators,  who  target  commercial  and  consumer  end  customers  of  all  sizes.  Large  multi-nationals  and  regional accounts  are  the  core  of  our  OEM  partners'  business;  however,  we  are  increasingly  focused  on  the  Value  Added Reseller  (VAR)  channel  which  resells  OEM  systems  to  the  mid-market  and  the  small  and  medium  business  (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with  their  software  and  services  solutions  into  Enterprise,  HPC  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  Customers.  Our  OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors  handle  a  wide  variety  of  products,  and  may  include  those  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our  agreements  with  distributors  protect  their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements  with  our  distributors  may  contain  standard  stock  rotation  provisions  permitting  limited  levels  of  product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.",

Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.

      "answer": "AMD consistently referenced the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan in its filings across all three years (2022\u20132024), indicating its foundational role in executive compensation. In 2022, the plan was listed alongside agreements like the Amended and Restated Management Continuity Agreement with Devinder Kumar (Exhibit 10.9) and Mark D. Papermaster\u2019s offer letter (Exhibit 10.10), suggesting its use in structuring individual executive compensation packages. In 2023, while the plan remained a core reference point, AMD introduced new debt-related exhibits tied to the Xilinx acquisition (e.g., Supplemental Indentures 4.5 and 4.6), signaling a broader financial strategy that may have impacted executive incentives. In 2024, the 2011 plan continued to be cited, but with fewer new executive-specific exhibits, potentially indicating a stabilization phase. This pattern reveals that AMD has maintained the 2011 plan as a consistent framework for executive incentives while adapting around it during periods of strategic change, such as the Xilinx integration, to retain leadership continuity.",

        "Hop 2: AMD(2023) \u2192 2011 Executive Incentive Plan: The plan remained a consistent reference point, but new exhibits focused more on debt instruments tied to the Xilinx acquisition, suggesting a shift in emphasis to financial structuring while maintaining executive compensation continuity.",
        "Hop 3: AMD(2024) \u2192 2011 Executive Incentive Plan: The plan was still cited, but with fewer new executive-related exhibits, potentially signaling a mature phase in its application and a stabilized executive retention approach post-acquisition."

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to its expanding international operations and increasing reliance on third-party manufacturing in Asia?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties remained a consistent risk factor, but the context and scope of this risk evolved alongside AMD's growing international operations and deepening reliance on third-party manufacturing in Asia. In 2022, AMD noted that its global operations posed challenges in protecting intellectual property, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. By 2023, the company emphasized its increasing international sales (65% of net revenue) and reliance on third-party manufacturing in China, Malaysia, and Taiwan, heightening exposure to IP risks in those regions. In 2024, AMD reiterated these concerns while also noting the geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan as a new layer of risk that could disrupt its manufacturing partners and adversely affect its business. This 3-year progression shows AMD's IP protection challenges becoming more complex and regionally concentrated, especially in Asia, as its global footprint and outsourcing model expanded.",

          "chunk_text": "The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection  measures  and  import  or  export  licensing  requirements;  difficulties  in  protecting  our  intellectual  property; difficulties  in  managing  staffing  and  exposure  to  different  employment  practices  and  labor  laws;  changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes  in  freight  and  interest  rates;  inflation;  disruption  in  air  transportation  between  the  United  States  and  our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with United States laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nIn  addition,  our  worldwide  operations  (or  those  of  our  business  partners)  could  be  subject  to  natural  disasters  and climate  change  such  as  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  flooding,  typhoons,  droughts,  fires,  extreme  heat  and  volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.  The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.",

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and disclosure of its 2.875% Notes due 2031 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about its long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "Oracle first disclosed the 2.875% Notes due 2031 in 2022 as part of a broader set of debt instruments, indicating the formalization of its long-term financing plans. In 2023, the company reaffirmed the inclusion of these notes in its capital structure, signaling continuity in its debt strategy. By 2024, the 2.875% Notes due 2031 remained a consistent part of Oracle's disclosed long-term obligations, demonstrating a stable and deliberate approach to long-term financing. This 3-year consistency in referencing the same instrument suggests Oracle's strategic intent to maintain a diversified and predictable debt maturity profile.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and disclosure of its 1.650% Notes due 2026 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this pattern indicate about its long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle issued the 1.650% Notes due 2026 as part of a broader set of debt instruments, with the terms set in March 2021. In 2023, the company continued to reference these notes as part of its structured debt portfolio, reaffirming their role in the capital structure. In 2024, Oracle again included the 1.650% Notes due 2026 in its disclosures, maintaining consistency in its debt presentation. The recurring inclusion and consistent treatment of these notes across all three years suggest a stable long-term debt strategy focused on predictable financing and investor transparency.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and structuring of its 3.650% Notes due 2041 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about Oracle's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "Oracle first introduced the 3.650% Notes due 2041 in 2022 as part of its broader debt issuance strategy, referencing them in filings alongside other long-term notes. In 2023, the company continued to include the 3.650% Notes due 2041 in its disclosures, reaffirming their role in Oracle\u2019s capital structure and indicating ongoing commitment to this long-term debt instrument. By 2024, Oracle maintained the presence of the 3.650% Notes due 2041 in its filings, signaling consistency in its long-term financing approach despite market fluctuations. This three-year continuity suggests Oracle's strategic intent to maintain stable long-term debt with defined maturity profiles.",

        "Hop 1: ORCL(2022) \u2192 3.650% Notes due 2041: The 3.650% Notes due 2041 are listed in Oracle\u2019s 2022 10-K filing, indicating their formal introduction as part of Oracle's long-term debt structure.",
        "Hop 2: ORCL(2023) \u2192 3.650% Notes due 2041: In the 2023 10-K filing, Oracle again includes the 3.650% Notes due 2041, reaffirming their continued relevance in Oracle\u2019s capital structure.",
        "Hop 3: ORCL(2024) \u2192 3.650% Notes due 2041: Oracle's 2024 10-K filing maintains the inclusion of the 3.650% Notes due 2041, showing no structural changes and reinforcing Oracle's consistent long-term debt strategy."

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance terms for its 2.300% Notes due 2028 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's approach to fixed-income financing in varying interest rate environments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle issued the 2.300% Notes due 2028 under an Officers' Certificate dated March 24, 2021 (filed as Exhibit 4.14 in the 2022 10-K), indicating the instrument was part of a multi-tiered bond offering that included other fixed-rate tranches like the 2.875% Notes due 2031 and 3.950% Notes due 2051. In 2023, Oracle referenced the same 2.300% Notes due 2028 under the same Officers' Certificate, showing no structural or rate changes to the instrument, but instead focused new issuance activity on higher-yielding instruments like the 4.500% Notes due 2028. By 2024, Oracle made no visible changes to the terms of the 2.300% Notes due 2028 and did not introduce any new 2028-dated instruments, suggesting a shift toward maintaining existing obligations rather than refinancing or repricing them. This pattern indicates Oracle's strategy of locking in favorable fixed-rate debt when possible, particularly during lower interest rate periods like those in 2021\u20132022, and avoiding redundant issuance when existing instruments remain competitive.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [ORCL](2023) \u2192 [2.300% Notes due 2028]: Oracle reiterates the terms of the 2.300% Notes due 2028, originally established in 2021, as part of a broader set of fixed-income instruments in Exhibit 4.14 of the 2023 10-K filing.",
        "Hop 2: [ORCL](2024) \u2192 [2.300% Notes due 2028]: Oracle continues to reference the same 2.300% Notes due 2028 without modification or new issuance activity, indicating stability in the debt structure.",
        "Hop 3: [ORCL](2022) \u2192 [2.300% Notes due 2028]: Oracle introduces the 2.300% Notes due 2028 under an Officers' Certificate issued March 24, 2021, as part of a multi-tiered issuance strategy that included various maturities and interest rates."

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's strategic positioning and financial reliance on 5G technologies evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of investment focus, licensing revenue structure, and projected market expansion across automotive and IoT sectors?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Qualcomm's strategic positioning and financial reliance on 5G technologies underwent a clear evolution. In 2022, the company emphasized the transformative potential of 5G in automotive and IoT markets, projecting that over 60% of new vehicles produced by 2028 would feature 5G connectivity and that IoT device installations would more than double from 2022 to 2026, surpassing 27 billion devices. By 2023, Qualcomm's focus shifted toward internal development of 5G and next-generation wireless technologies as a core growth driver, with explicit mention of substantial R&D investments and the risk associated with customer vertical integration potentially impacting revenue. In 2024, the company solidified its licensing model around 5G, noting that the vast majority of QTL revenues came from OFDMA-based (3G/4G/5G) multimode devices, with per-unit royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price. Additionally, Qualcomm Ventures expanded its strategic investments into 5G-enabled sectors like AI, automotive, and IoT, signaling a broader ecosystem play. This trajectory shows a shift from market opportunity articulation (2022) to internal R&D emphasis (2023), culminating in a mature licensing and investment-driven 5G monetization strategy (2024).",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Such governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. '\n\nQSI Segment. QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including but not limited to 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business and our cloud computing processing initiative. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7.

We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax , contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.

As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's human capital goals and their linkage to executive compensation evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of diversity targets and performance modifiers?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Qualcomm established specific 2025 diversity goals, including increasing women and underrepresented minorities (URM) in leadership roles by 15% and overall URM representation by 20%. Progress toward these goals influenced executive bonuses via a non-financial modifier that could adjust payouts by a factor of 0.9 to 1.1. In fiscal 2023, the company maintained the same executive compensation linkage, emphasizing continued focus on diversity and inclusion, with recognition in multiple regions and participation in initiatives like the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition. By fiscal 2024, the structure of the executive compensation modifier remained unchanged, but the company expanded its global engagement efforts and highlighted broader wellness and development programs, indicating a deepening integration of human capital metrics into corporate strategy. This 3-year progression shows Qualcomm's sustained emphasis on diversity-linked executive incentives while expanding supporting programs.",

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Texas Instruments' Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan remained unfunded and closed to new participants, with the company continuing to emphasize defined contribution alternatives. In 2022, the U.S. defined contribution plans held 6 million shares of TI common stock valued at $940 million, while in 2023, this decreased to 5 million shares valued at $873 million, and remained at 5 million shares in 2024, valued at $852 million. Dividends paid on these shares declined slightly from $28 million in 2022 to $27 million in 2023 and $26 million in 2024. The company's aggregate expense for U.S. defined contribution plans increased steadily across the period\u2014$70 million in 2022, $75 million in 2023, and $76 million in 2024\u2014suggesting a growing emphasis on defined contribution plans as the primary retirement vehicle for employees.

Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are prov ided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after Nov ember 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.

      "answer": "Texas Instruments' revenue allocation to the PC & Notebooks segment declined from 24% in 2022 to 15% in 2023, and then slightly increased to 20% in 2024. This trajectory indicates a notable reduction in emphasis on PC & Notebooks during 2022\u20132023, followed by a partial rebound in 2024. During this same period, the Automotive market\u2019s revenue share grew from 21% in 2022 to 35% in 2024, while the Industrial market remained strong, decreasing only slightly from 41% to 34%. These shifts suggest a strategic refocusing toward higher-growth and more specialized markets like automotive and industrial applications, even as the company maintained a presence in the PC & Notebooks space.",

      "question": "How did the carrying value of NVIDIA's 3.50% Notes Due 2050 evolve from fiscal year 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's long-term debt valuation or positioning?",
      "answer": "The carrying value of NVIDIA's 3.50% Notes Due 2050 decreased from $2,147 million in fiscal year 2022 to $1,604 million in fiscal year 2023, and then increased to $2,000 million in fiscal year 2024. This fluctuation indicates a revaluation or strategic adjustment in how the long-term liability was accounted for, rather than a consistent downward trend in debt reduction. The rebound in 2024 to a higher value than 2023 suggests a deliberate positioning of long-term liabilities, possibly tied to refinancing, market interest rate adjustments, or changes in debt management strategy.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA disclosed a liability of $1,200 million for the 2.00% Notes Due 2031. In fiscal year 2023, this liability increased slightly to $1,044 million, and by fiscal year 2024, the company reported a carrying value of $1,250 million for the same notes. This progression indicates a relatively stable but slightly increasing long-term financial commitment to the 2.00% Notes Due 2031, suggesting a consistent debt strategy with minor adjustments over time.",

      "question": "How has the competitive positioning of Lumentum Holdings within NVIDIA's disclosed competitor landscape evolved across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to NVIDIA's expanding focus on AI-driven networking solutions and interconnect technologies?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Lumentum Holdings was listed among suppliers of interconnect, switch, and cable solutions, grouped with companies like Juniper Networks and Applied Optoelectronics, indicating a foundational competitive presence in optical networking. By fiscal year 2023, Lumentum was repositioned within a more specialized segment focused on high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, and proprietary technologies, aligning with NVIDIA's growing emphasis on AI and accelerated computing infrastructure. In fiscal year 2024, Lumentum was again listed among competitors in the networking segment, but now under the more specific designation of 'Lumentum Holdings Inc.', suggesting a sharpened recognition of its corporate identity and competitive relevance in NVIDIA's expanding networking and data center ecosystem. This progression shows Lumentum's rising prominence as a competitor in NVIDIA's strategic AI and interconnect technology domains.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NVDA(2023) \u2192 Lumentum Holdings: Lumentum is identified as a competitor in the networking segment focused on high-performance interconnect products including InfiniBand and Ethernet, reflecting NVIDIA's strategic emphasis on AI-driven infrastructure.",
        "Hop 2: NVDA(2024) \u2192 Lumentum Holdings: Lumentum is now referred to as 'Lumentum Holdings Inc.', indicating a more formal recognition of its corporate structure and continued relevance in NVIDIA\u2019s competitive landscape, particularly in networking solutions aligned with AI and data center growth.",
        "Hop 3: NVDA(2022) \u2192 Lumentum Holdings: Lumentum was listed among providers of interconnect, switch, and cable solutions, grouped with Juniper Networks and Applied Optoelectronics, suggesting a broader, less specialized competitive categorization at that time."

Our  supply  chain  is  mainly  concentrated  in  the  A sia-Pacific  region.  We  utilize  foundries,  such  as  T aiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSM C, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix Inc., M icron T echnology , Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly , testing and packaging of our final products.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,  conformity  to  industry  standard A PIs,  manufacturing  capabilities,  processor  pricing,  and  total  system  costs.  W e  believe  that  our  ability   to  remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver  consistent  volumes  of  our  products  at  acceptable  levels  of  quality   and  at  competitiv e  prices.  W e  ex pect  competition  to  increase  from  both  ex isting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\n\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for A I, such as A dv anced M icro Devices, Inc., or A M D, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or A I computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as A libaba Group, A lphabet Inc., A mazon, Inc., or A mazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and M icrosoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\n- suppliers of A rm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and M icrosoft;\n- suppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as A mbarella, Inc., A M D, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\n- networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical modules) include such as A M D, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company , Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and M arvell T echnology , Inc. as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally . Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP . The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in A sia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely . We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;",

Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods.

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and structuring of its 2.875% Notes due 2031 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle filed the 2.875% Notes due 2031 as part of a broader issuance that included various other notes with maturities ranging from 2025 to 2060 and interest rates between 1.650% and 4.100%. In 2023, Oracle continued to reference the 2.875% Notes due 2031 within a similar context, alongside newer issuances such as the 4.500% Notes due 2028 and 5.550% Notes due 2053, indicating a consistent approach to maintaining a diversified maturity profile. In 2024, Oracle again included the 2.875% Notes due 2031 in its disclosures, reaffirming its commitment to this long-term debt instrument while also maintaining exposure to higher-yielding, longer-dated notes like the 5.550% Notes due 2053. The consistent inclusion and reference to the 2.875% Notes due 2031 across all three filings suggest Oracle's strategic use of this instrument as a stable component of its capital structure, even as it adjusts to shifting interest rate environments and capital market conditions.",

      "answer": "Oracle first disclosed the 1.650% Notes due 2026 in its 2022 10-K filing, referencing the March 24, 2021 8-K filing where the terms of the Notes were established. In the 2023 10-K filing, Oracle continued to reference the same 8-K filing from March 2021, indicating no changes to the Notes' structure or terms. Similarly, in the 2024 10-K filing, Oracle again referenced the original March 2021 8-K for the 1.650% Notes due 2026, maintaining the same unchanged structure. This consistent referencing of the original filing across three annual reports suggests a deliberate strategy of maintaining stable short-term debt obligations without modification, even as Oracle introduced new debt instruments with different rates and maturities in subsequent years.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and documentation of the 4.30% Note due 2034 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern reveal about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "Oracle first documented the 4.30% Note due 2034 in 2022 as part of a broader issuance that included the 3.40% Note due 2024 and the 4.50% Note due 2044, with terms set in an Officers' Certificate dated July 8, 2014. In 2023 and 2024, the company continued to reference the same July 8, 2014 Officers' Certificate for the 4.30% Note due 2034, indicating no changes to the terms or structure of this long-term debt instrument over the three-year period. This consistency suggests Oracle maintained a stable long-term debt profile for this particular note, focusing instead on issuing newer short- and medium-term notes to meet current financing needs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ORCL(2022) \u2192 4.30% Note 2034: Oracle references the 4.30% Note due 2034 as part of a July 8, 2014 Officers' Certificate, alongside the 3.40% Note due 2024 and 4.50% Note due 2044.",
        "Hop 2: ORCL(2023) \u2192 4.30% Note 2034: The 4.30% Note due 2034 is again referenced using the same July 8, 2014 Officers' Certificate, showing no changes in documentation or terms.",
        "Hop 3: ORCL(2024) \u2192 4.30% Note 2034: Oracle continues to reference the identical July 8, 2014 Officers' Certificate for the 4.30% Note due 2034, confirming ongoing consistency in long-term debt structure."

      "question": "How did Oracle's introduction and continuation of its 3.650% Notes due 2041 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about Oracle's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "Oracle first introduced the 3.650% Notes due 2041 in 2022 as part of its long-term debt instruments, continued to reference the same notes in 2023 alongside newer bond issuances, and reaffirmed its inclusion in 2024 within the broader context of its registered securities. This consistent inclusion over three years indicates Oracle's strategic use of long-term debt to fund operations and maintain financial flexibility. The persistence of the 3.650% Notes due 2041 in Oracle's capital structure suggests a stable long-term financing approach, complemented by periodic new issuances to meet evolving capital needs.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and structuring of the 2.300% Notes due 2028 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about Oracle's broader debt financing strategy during this period?",
      "answer": "Oracle first introduced the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in 2022 as part of a broader set of debt instruments outlined in Exhibit 4.16, which also included other notes such as the 1.650% Notes due 2026 and 2.875% Notes due 2031. In 2023, Oracle continued to reference the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in Exhibit 4.14, alongside newer issuances such as the 4.500% Notes due 2028. In 2024, Oracle again referenced the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in Exhibit 4.14, maintaining continuity with prior disclosures while continuing to include newer notes like the 4.500% Notes due 2028.

      "question": "How did Adobe's Photography Plan evolve from 2022 to 2024 in terms of its positioning within the Creative Cloud ecosystem, and what specific enhancements or strategic shifts were made across those years to attract photographers and creative professionals?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Adobe's Photography Plan became more integrated and enhanced within the Creative Cloud ecosystem. In 2022, it was positioned as a targeted package for photographers and photo enthusiasts, offering Photoshop, Lightroom, and Lightroom Classic. By 2023, Adobe emphasized the Photography Plan within a broader product-led growth strategy, integrating generative AI capabilities and offering Generative Credits to enhance creative workflows. In 2024, the Photography Plan was further refined with AI-powered features in Photoshop and Lightroom, such as Generative Fill, Lens Blur, and People Masking, making it a more robust offering for photographers while remaining a more limited alternative to the full Creative Cloud suite. This evolution reflects Adobe\u2019s strategic shift to infuse AI into creative tools and position the Photography Plan as a streamlined, yet powerful, solution for photographers.",

Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Creative Cloud Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of business customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval purposes, copywriting or  leveraging  templates  for  social  media  marketing.  We  utilize  channel  partners  to  target  mid-size  creative  customers  with  our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption  of  our  Creative  Cloud  for  enterprise  offering.  Overall,  our  strategy  with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to increase  our  revenue  with  existing  users,  attract  new  customers  and  grow  a  recurring  and  predictable  revenue  stream  that  is recognized ratably.\n\nIn  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  we  expect  to  drive  sustained  long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web's functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat, integrate Adobe Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces, drive innovation with Adobe Sensei (machine-learning/AI) to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Sign APIs, and leverage diversified go-tomarket motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a datadriven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.\n\nAs our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features 'Liquid Mode' to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is also available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe  Sign  also  provides  a  green  alternative  to  costly,  paper-based  solutions  and  offers  a  modern,  convenient  solution  for customers  to  digitally  manage  their  documents,  automate  processes  and  contract  workflows.  We  believe  that  by  growing  the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\n## Opportunity\n\nDigital  transformation  is  a  macro  trend  that  affects  every  business,  government  and  educational  institution  today-every business  is  a  digital  business.  Consumers  today  buy  experiences,  not  just  products,  and  they  demand  personalized  digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, which drives business-to-business ('B2B') companies to deliver business-toconsumer ('B2C') experiences with a 'business-to-everyone' ('B2E') strategy. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world's leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.\n\nAdobe  Experience  Cloud  is  powering  digital  businesses  by  providing  exceptional  experiences  to  their  customers  via  a comprehensive suite of solutions. We continue to believe that addressing the challenges of customer experience management is",

Our  eLearning  solutions  and  web  conferencing  products  face  competition  from  a  number  of  established products from other large software companies. Competition involves a number of factors, including product features, ease-of-use, the level of customization and integration supported, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, their complementarity with our Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Digital Experience products and our strong brand among users.\n\n## PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n## Digital Media Offerings\n\n## Adobe Creative Cloud\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a cloud-based subscription to a collection of Apps that enables creative professionals and enthusiasts alike to express themselves and collaborate with Apps and services for photography, design, video, social media, and more that connect across surfaces, platforms and geographies. Subscribers have access to cloud storage to easily sync, access, collaborate and share their work, files and assets.\n\nCreative  Cloud  paid  plans  include  the  Adobe  Firefly  web  App,  the  premium  version  of  Adobe  Ex press,  and  AI-powered  features  natively  integrated throughout Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Premiere Pro. Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, and Adobe Express plans include a monthly allocation of Generative Credits, which are tokens that enable subscribers to use our generative AI features to generate content using text-based prompts. All Apps listed below and many more are available through subscriptions to Creative Cloud (except Substance 3D Apps, which are sold separately through the Adobe Substance 3D Collection plan), and many of our Apps are also available as standalone subscriptions on Adobe.com. Adobe Acrobat Pro is available as part of our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription and on a standalone basis and allows users to create, convert and edit PDFs, including text and images. Additionally, certain Creative Cloud Apps, such as Adobe Express, are available in Adobe G enStudio for Performance Marketing, allowing users to quickly use assets and Creative Cloud tools to create on-brand content.\n\n## Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom\n\nAdobe Photoshop is the world's most advanced digital imaging and design App, with powerful editing and effects tools to transform photos. It is available on desktop, iPad and through a web version. Features include G enerative Fill, G enerative Expand, G enerate Similar and G enerate Background, which allow our customers to use text prompts to quickly create, add to, remove, duplicate or replace images, or expand the borders of an existing image with AI-generated content without leaving Adobe Photoshop; the Adjustment Brush Tool, whichcombines the traditional workflow of selecting, masking, and applying an adjustment into one step, simplifying the way of making local adjustments; and Distraction Removal smart technology to help remove people, wires, poles and other distractions from images. Adobe Lightroom is our cloud-based photo App that allows subscribers to edit, organize, store and share photos across desktop, tablet, mobile devices and the web. Features include Lens Blur to blur the background or foreground by making a depth map of the photo using AI; the Denoise feature to remove noise in RAW photos; People Masking features to automatically select and edit facial hair and clothing; and G enerative Remove, which uses Adobe Firefly to remove unwanted objects and distractions in a photo. In addition to individual subscriptions to Photoshop and Lightroom, we offer a Photography Plan, which is a more limited cloud-based offering than Creative Cloud, targeted at photographers and photo enthusiasts and includes Photoshop, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic.\n\n## Table of Contents",

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe highlighted Acrobat's leadership position in document-intensive industries and its role in accelerating digital transformation through Adobe Document Cloud, with trillions of PDFs created annually. In 2023, Adobe formally introduced AI as a core strategic focus across its offerings, signaling an evolution in its product development plans, including enhancements to document workflows. By 2024, Adobe formalized this strategy through branded product extensions like 'Acrobat AI Assistant,' indicating a clear trajectory from Acrobat's foundational document role toward AI-enhanced productivity tools. This evolution reflects a multi-year investment in integrating AI capabilities into Acrobat, aligning with Adobe\u2019s broader innovation momentum and market opportunity in document intelligence.",

In this era of connected creativity, we envision Creative Cloud functioning as a creative system, keeping our users connected to everything and everyone they need to make a project successful. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow by expanding content-first, task-based creativity, advancing every creative category across desktop, web and mobile, expanding 3D and immersive content creation, enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders and inspiring and empowering the creative community through sharing and monetization.\n\nAdobe's  Digital  Media  segment  also  includes  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  a  unified,  cloud-based  document services platform, which integrates Adobe's pioneering PDF technology with our Acrobat and Adobe Sign applications to deliver fully digital document workflows. Digital documents have a mission-critical role in powering modern businesses with hundreds of millions  of  communicators  worldwide  interacting  with  documents  every  day.  With  this  digital  transformation,  we  have  the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. In our Adobe Document Cloud business, Adobe Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption and a leadership  position  in  document-intensive  industries  such  as  government,  financial  services,  pharmaceutical,  legal,  aerospace, insurance and technical publishing. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy, and there are hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document services platform found in Document Cloud.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer  a  range  of  products  and  services  that  allow  individuals,  teams,  small  and  medium  businesses,  enterprises  and  government institutions,  including  both  professionals  and  enthusiasts,  to  design  and  deliver  content  seamlessly.  With  content  creation, consumption and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth through innovation to make our creative applications more accessible and easier to learn and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.\n\nWe continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering content-first, task-based creativity with our launch of Creative Cloud Express, a web and mobile application with a content- and template-first experience to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily, in December 2021. We aim to continue to advance every creative category across desktop, web and mobile. We have delivered our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom, on desktop and mobile devices to allow users the ability to work from anywhere on any device and to collaborate with stakeholders. We are building collaboration deeply into our applications and workflows to enable seamless collaboration across stakeholders. We are taking Creative Cloud to the web, beginning with a public beta version of Photoshop, which will allow Creative Cloud subscribers to make edits to and collaborate on their files directly in their browser. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications. We continue to introduce new features and solutions in our products, such as auto-masking and new and improved neural filters in Photoshop, auto-captioning in Premiere, adjustment layers and perspective grids in Adobe Fresco and additional motion features in Adobe  XD. We  are  pursuing  new  ways  to  inspire,  empower  and  connect  the  creative  community,  such  as  through  our  Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range  of  other  creative  tools  and  services,  including  hobbyist  products,  such  as  Photoshop  Elements  and  Premiere  Elements; libraries  of  creative  assets,  such  as Adobe  Stock  and Adobe  Fonts;  mobile-first  apps,  such  as  Photoshop  Camera;  and  Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under 'Principal Products and Services.'\n\nOn October 7, 2021, Adobe acquired Frame.io and began integrating its leading cloud-based video collaboration platform into  Adobe  Creative  Cloud.  With  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  we  aim  to  make  the  creative  process  even  more  collaborative, productive  and  efficient  by  enhancing  Adobe  Creative  Cloud  with  Frame.io's  cloud-native  collaboration  workflows,  while continuing  to  enable  third-party  applications.  As  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  we  are  more  deeply  integrating  and  enhancing Frame.io's review and approval capabilities in Premiere Pro and After Effects to deliver a native collaborative platform for video editing.\n\nIn our Creative Cloud business, we continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to move our customers to bettervalue offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. As part of our strategy, we use a data-driven operating model and our Digital Experience solutions offered through Adobe",

We enter these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  technological  developments  in  the  industry  and  ex pand  our  opportunities  to  provide Adobe products, services, and solutions.\n\n## RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT\n\nWith the speed of innovation and technological change that characterizes the software industry, a continuous high level of investment is required for the research and development of the cutting-edge technologies that lead to the development of new products, services and solutions and the continual enhancement of existing products, services and solutions. Our Adobe Research team of research scientists, engineers, artists and designers help turn ideas into technologies that power the future of our products, services and solutions. We are investing, and intend to continue to invest, in research and development to strengthen our existing products, services and solutions, and to expand our offerings across our clouds and the next generation of AI, machine learning and deep learning-driven tools and features to solve problems in areas such as content understanding and generation, recommendations, personalization and more.\n\nIn addition to our own research and development, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe  protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign  intellectual  property  laws, confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and  pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile Apps to users and customers under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  and  customers  under  'click  through'  or  signed  agreements containing  restrictions  on  access  and  use.  Our  enterprise  customers  license  our  hosted  offerings  as  SaaS  or  Managed  Services  via  agreements  based  on  our enterprise licensing terms.\n\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop Apps with the same functionality as our Apps. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe Document Cloud was primarily positioned as part of Adobe's legacy Publishing and Advertising segment, focused on document and forms platform services. By 2023, Document Cloud was repositioned as a core component of Adobe's Digital Media segment, explicitly tied to strategic investments in AI and innovation momentum. In 2024, Document Cloud became more deeply integrated with Adobe's AI capabilities like Firefly's generative AI features and collaboration platforms like Frame.io, reflecting its expanded role in enabling enterprise content workflows with AI-powered document productivity tools and cloud-based collaboration features.",

Firefly-powered generative AI features are also available in a number of our products including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Express, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Stock. Firefly is available for free with a limited number of G enerative Credits per month. Once that limit is reached, users and subscribers can buy additional Generative Credits through a Firefly paid subscription plan.\n\nAlso available for enterprises are Adobe Firefly Services and Custom Models. Firefly Services provides enterprises with APIs, tools and services for content generation, editing and assembly, to automate the production of content while maintaining quality and control. Custom Models enable enterprises to train generative AI models based on their intellectual property, product and brand styles across a wide variety of use cases such as localization or merchandising for e-commerce, maintaining and propagating brand consistency at scale across their organizations.\n\nAdobe Firefly-generated content is designed to be commercially safe. The Firefly generative AI model is trained on data Adobe has the rights to use. Every asset created using Firefly includes Content Credentials, a digital 'nutrition label', to indicate that generative AI was used, bringing more trust and transparency to digital content.\n\n## Adobe Stock\n\nAdobe Stock provides designers and businesses with access to millions of high-quality, curated, royalty-free photos, vectors, illustrations, videos, templates, audio and 3D assets, for all their creative projects.

Frame.io is directly integrated with Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Workfront to allow video creators to request and receive streamlined frame-specific comments directly in those Apps.  Frame.io's  Camera to  Cloud functionality allows creators to automatically upload footage from cameras and other recording devices on set directly into Frame.io for review, with integrations for still image cameras that can connect natively to the platform. Frame.io, along with Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly Services, are available in Adobe G enStudio to enable content production at scale.\n\n## Adobe Substance 3D Collection\n\nAdobe Substance 3D is an ecosystem of desktop Apps, including Substance 3D Stager, Substance 3D Painter, Substance 3D Sampler, Substance 3D Designer and Substance 3D Modeler.

      "question": "How did Adobe's integration and positioning of Frame.io evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of supported file types, application integrations, and role in content production workflows?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Frame.io was listed as a registered trademark under Adobe's intellectual property, indicating its acquisition and initial branding alignment. By 2023, Frame.io was described as a cloud-native creative collaboration platform integrated with Premiere Pro and After Effects, supporting still images, design files, and PDFs, with Camera-to-Cloud functionality for video production. In 2024, Frame.io expanded its integration to include Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Workfront, and broadened its role beyond post-production into casting, location scouting, and marketing campaign management, reflecting its deepening role in end-to-end content creation workflows.",

      "answer": "Microsoft consistently reaffirmed its 3.700% Notes due 2046 across all three reporting years without altering their terms. In each of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, was referenced, explicitly listing the 3.700% Notes due 2046 alongside other long-term debt instruments. The absence of modifications to these notes across all three years indicates a deliberate strategy of maintaining stable, long-dated liabilities with fixed interest obligations. This consistent treatment suggests Microsoft views these notes as a core component of its capital structure, reflecting confidence in long-term cash flow projections and a preference for predictable debt servicing costs.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of 2.000% Notes due in 2023 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's 2.000% Notes due in 2023 were consistently referenced in all three annual reports (2022, 2023, and 2024) as part of the company's broader debt structure, indicating a stable inclusion in Microsoft's long-term financing strategy. In 2022, the notes were listed in Exhibit 4.14 under the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. In 2023, the same notes were again referenced in Exhibit 4.14 with identical details, showing no change in the structure or maturity. By 2024, the notes remained in the disclosures under the same exhibit, confirming that Microsoft maintained this liability on its books through the 2024 reporting period, even as the due date approached. This consistency suggests that Microsoft did not retire or refinance the 2.000% Notes ahead of schedule, reflecting a deliberate and steady approach to managing its long-term debt obligations.",

      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 4.000% Notes due 2021 in its 10-K filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, always listing the Third Supplemental Indenture under Exhibit 4.6, dated February 8, 2011, and incorporated by reference from a prior 8-K filing. There were no material changes in the description or structure of the Notes across the three years, indicating that the debt instrument remained static in terms of documentation and disclosure treatment. This suggests that the Notes were matured or fully accounted for, with no further amendments or actions required by the company during this reporting period.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's long-term debt structure evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly regarding the 3.950% Notes due 2056, and what does this multi-year inclusion reveal about the company's long-term capital strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft consistently included the 3.950% Notes due 2056 in its long-term debt disclosures across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating a sustained reliance on this instrument as part of its capital structure. The Notes were first introduced in the 2016 filing and remained a recurring feature in subsequent years, demonstrating Microsoft's long-term financing strategy anchored in fixed-rate instruments with extended maturities. This consistency suggests a strategic preference for long-duration debt to fund operations, acquisitions, or R&D, with the 2056 Notes serving as a key component of its debt portfolio over the analyzed period.",

        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [3.950% Notes due 2056]: The 2023 filing again referenced the same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture for the 3.950% Notes due 2056, showing no structural change or early redemption.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's approach to structuring its 2.125% Notes evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of associated trustee arrangements and related debt instruments disclosed in each filing?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft disclosed the Seventh Supplemental Indenture for the 2.125% Notes due 2021 alongside the 3.125% Notes due 2028, under the trustee relationship with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as part of a broader set of debt instruments. In 2023, the structure remained consistent, with the same trustee named and the 2.125% Notes due 2021 still listed alongside the same associated debt instruments. In 2024, the filing repeated the same exhibit description and trustee relationship, indicating no changes in the structure or administration of the 2.125% Notes over the three-year period. This consistency suggests that Microsoft maintained a stable debt servicing and trustee arrangement for this instrument throughout the period.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and introduction of the 2.875% Notes due 2031 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about Oracle's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle formally listed the 2.875% Notes due 2031 among its issued debt instruments, indicating the company's ongoing access to long-term capital markets. By 2023, the Notes were reaffirmed in Oracle's 10-K filing, showing continuity in the company's capital structure and ongoing commitment to this tranche of long-term debt. In 2024, Oracle again included the 2.875% Notes due 2031 in its filings, but now alongside newer, higher-yielding notes (e.g., 4.500% Notes due 2028 and 4.900% Notes due 2033), suggesting a strategic shift toward diversifying its debt portfolio with higher interest instruments as market conditions evolved. This 3-year progression shows Oracle maintaining the 2.875% Notes as a stable component of its capital structure while layering in newer, costlier debt, potentially reflecting changing borrowing costs and strategic capital allocation decisions.",

      "question": "How has Oracle's continued inclusion of the 1.650% Notes due 2026 in its capital structure across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 reflected its debt financing strategy relative to other newly introduced notes with higher interest rates?",
      "answer": "Oracle consistently included the 1.650% Notes due 2026 in its capital structure across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, as evidenced by their repeated listing in Exhibits 4.16 (2022), 4.14 (2023), and 4.14 (2024). During the same period, Oracle introduced new notes with significantly higher interest rates, such as the 5.800% Notes due 2025 in 2023 and the 4.500% Notes due 2028 in 2024. This pattern suggests Oracle has maintained access to lower-cost debt capital over time while also tapping into the market for higher-yielding instruments, potentially reflecting a dual strategy of preserving liquidity through favorable borrowing terms and raising additional capital at varying rates to support long-term investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ORCL(2022) \u2192 1.650% Notes due 2026: Listed in Exhibit 4.16, indicating Oracle's inclusion of these notes in its capital structure.",
        "Hop 2: ORCL(2023) \u2192 1.650% Notes due 2026: Repeatedly listed in Exhibit 4.14, showing continued presence in Oracle\u2019s debt portfolio alongside newer, higher-interest notes like the 5.800% Notes due 2025.",
        "Hop 3: ORCL(2024) \u2192 1.650% Notes due 2026: Still included in Exhibit 4.14, demonstrating ongoing strategic relevance even as newer instruments like the 4.500% Notes due 2028 were introduced."

      "question": "How did Oracle's inclusion of the 4.30% Note due 2034 in its debt instrument disclosures evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this pattern suggest about its long-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle included the 4.30% Note due 2034 as part of a set of forms filed alongside other long-term notes, indicating its ongoing commitment to long-term financing. In 2023, the 4.30% Note due 2034 was again referenced in a similar context, showing continuity in Oracle's long-term debt structure. By 2024, Oracle continued to include the 4.30% Note due 2034 in its disclosures, reaffirming its strategic reliance on this instrument as part of its broader debt portfolio. The consistent inclusion of this note across all three years suggests Oracle's stable long-term debt strategy and confidence in managing extended maturity obligations.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's treatment of its 3.650% Notes due 2041 evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of their registration status and documentation continuity across filings?",
      "answer": "Oracle's 3.650% Notes due 2041 were first documented through an Officers' Certificate dated March 24, 2021, which was incorporated by reference in the 2022 10-K filing (Exhibit 4.14). In 2023, the Notes remained part of the company's registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, as noted in Exhibit 4.17 of the 2023 10-K filing. This continuity persisted in 2024, where the Notes were again referenced in Exhibit 4.14 of the 2024 10-K, confirming their ongoing registration and consistent documentation framework. This 3-year pattern demonstrates Oracle's sustained commitment to maintaining the 3.650% Notes due 2041 as a registered long-term debt instrument without structural changes.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and structuring of the 2.300% Notes due 2028 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about Oracle's broader debt financing strategy during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle referenced the 2.300% Notes due 2028 as part of a broader set of debt instruments, indicating its ongoing reliance on fixed-rate financing. In both 2023 and 2024, Oracle continued to include the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in its filings, alongside newer instruments with higher interest rates, such as the 4.500% Notes due 2028 in 2023 and the 5.800% Notes due 2025 in 2024. This pattern suggests Oracle's strategy involved maintaining a mix of older, lower-cost debt while issuing newer, more expensive instruments, likely to manage refinancing needs and fund strategic initiatives amid rising interest rates.",

        "Hop 1: ORCL(2022) \u2192 2.300% Notes due 2028: Oracle included the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in its 2022 10-K filing, indicating it was part of the company\u2019s active debt portfolio.",
        "Hop 2: ORCL(2024) \u2192 2.300% Notes due 2028: Oracle again referenced the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in 2024, but now alongside newer, higher-yielding instruments like the 4.500% Notes due 2028 (filed in 2023) and 5.800% Notes due 2025 (filed in 2022).",
        "Hop 3: ORCL(2023) \u2192 2.300% Notes due 2028: In 2023, Oracle again listed the 2.300% Notes due 2028, and introduced the 4.500% Notes due 2028, signaling a shift toward higher-cost financing."

      "question": "How did Adobe's Photography Plan evolve from its initial introduction in 2022, through strategic enhancements in 2023, to its positioning within Adobe's broader creative ecosystem in 2024, and what does this progression indicate about Adobe's focus on photographers and photo enthusiasts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe introduced the Photography Plan as a targeted package within Creative Cloud, offering a more limited cloud-based offering than the full Creative Cloud suite, specifically tailored for photographers and photo enthusiasts, including Photoshop, Lightroom, and Lightroom Classic. In 2023, Adobe enhanced the Photography Plan by integrating AI-powered features such as Generative Fill and Generative Expand in Photoshop, and Lens Blur and Denoise in Lightroom, aiming to improve user experience and increase engagement through advanced editing capabilities. By 2024, the Photography Plan was more deeply embedded within Adobe's broader creative ecosystem, with continued emphasis on AI-driven tools and cross-app integration, such as Adobe Firefly and Adobe Express, while also being part of the Creative Cloud All Apps subscription, which allowed for broader access and alignment with Adobe's overall digital experience strategy. This progression indicates Adobe's sustained focus on photographers as a key demographic and its strategy to increase the value and accessibility of its creative tools through AI and integration.",

Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Creative Cloud Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of business customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval purposes, copywriting or  leveraging  templates  for  social  media  marketing.  We  utilize  channel  partners  to  target  mid-size  creative  customers  with  our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption  of  our  Creative  Cloud  for  enterprise  offering.  Overall,  our  strategy  with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to increase  our  revenue  with  existing  users,  attract  new  customers  and  grow  a  recurring  and  predictable  revenue  stream  that  is recognized ratably.\n\nIn  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  we  expect  to  drive  sustained  long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web's functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat, integrate Adobe Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces, drive innovation with Adobe Sensei (machine-learning/AI) to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Sign APIs, and leverage diversified go-tomarket motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a datadriven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.\n\nAs our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features 'Liquid Mode' to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is also available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe  Sign  also  provides  a  green  alternative  to  costly,  paper-based  solutions  and  offers  a  modern,  convenient  solution  for customers  to  digitally  manage  their  documents,  automate  processes  and  contract  workflows.  We  believe  that  by  growing  the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\n## Opportunity\n\nDigital  transformation  is  a  macro  trend  that  affects  every  business,  government  and  educational  institution  today-every business  is  a  digital  business.  Consumers  today  buy  experiences,  not  just  products,  and  they  demand  personalized  digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, which drives business-to-business ('B2B') companies to deliver business-toconsumer ('B2C') experiences with a 'business-to-everyone' ('B2E') strategy. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world's leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.\n\nAdobe  Experience  Cloud  is  powering  digital  businesses  by  providing  exceptional  experiences  to  their  customers  via  a comprehensive suite of solutions. We continue to believe that addressing the challenges of customer experience management is",

Our  eLearning  solutions  and  web  conferencing  products  face  competition  from  a  number  of  established products from other large software companies. Competition involves a number of factors, including product features, ease-of-use, the level of customization and integration supported, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, their complementarity with our Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Digital Experience products and our strong brand among users.\n\n## PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n## Digital Media Offerings\n\n## Adobe Creative Cloud\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a cloud-based subscription to a collection of Apps that enables creative professionals and enthusiasts alike to express themselves and collaborate with Apps and services for photography, design, video, social media, and more that connect across surfaces, platforms and geographies. Subscribers have access to cloud storage to easily sync, access, collaborate and share their work, files and assets.\n\nCreative  Cloud  paid  plans  include  the  Adobe  Firefly  web  App,  the  premium  version  of  Adobe  Ex press,  and  AI-powered  features  natively  integrated throughout Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Premiere Pro. Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, and Adobe Express plans include a monthly allocation of Generative Credits, which are tokens that enable subscribers to use our generative AI features to generate content using text-based prompts. All Apps listed below and many more are available through subscriptions to Creative Cloud (except Substance 3D Apps, which are sold separately through the Adobe Substance 3D Collection plan), and many of our Apps are also available as standalone subscriptions on Adobe.com. Adobe Acrobat Pro is available as part of our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription and on a standalone basis and allows users to create, convert and edit PDFs, including text and images. Additionally, certain Creative Cloud Apps, such as Adobe Express, are available in Adobe G enStudio for Performance Marketing, allowing users to quickly use assets and Creative Cloud tools to create on-brand content.\n\n## Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom\n\nAdobe Photoshop is the world's most advanced digital imaging and design App, with powerful editing and effects tools to transform photos. It is available on desktop, iPad and through a web version. Features include G enerative Fill, G enerative Expand, G enerate Similar and G enerate Background, which allow our customers to use text prompts to quickly create, add to, remove, duplicate or replace images, or expand the borders of an existing image with AI-generated content without leaving Adobe Photoshop; the Adjustment Brush Tool, whichcombines the traditional workflow of selecting, masking, and applying an adjustment into one step, simplifying the way of making local adjustments; and Distraction Removal smart technology to help remove people, wires, poles and other distractions from images. Adobe Lightroom is our cloud-based photo App that allows subscribers to edit, organize, store and share photos across desktop, tablet, mobile devices and the web. Features include Lens Blur to blur the background or foreground by making a depth map of the photo using AI; the Denoise feature to remove noise in RAW photos; People Masking features to automatically select and edit facial hair and clothing; and G enerative Remove, which uses Adobe Firefly to remove unwanted objects and distractions in a photo. In addition to individual subscriptions to Photoshop and Lightroom, we offer a Photography Plan, which is a more limited cloud-based offering than Creative Cloud, targeted at photographers and photo enthusiasts and includes Photoshop, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic.\n\n## Table of Contents",

      "question": "How did Adobe's positioning and strategic emphasis on free online self-service learning evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to its fee-based learning programs and enterprise customer enablement initiatives such as solution-specific skills assessments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe introduced free online self-service learning as part of its broader learning and enablement services, positioning it alongside fee-based programs like classroom and virtual training on www.training.adobe.com. The emphasis was on offering a comprehensive portfolio to assist customer and partner teams in product adoption. By 2023, Adobe maintained this structure but highlighted the integration of free self-service learning within its enterprise customer enablement strategy, specifically mentioning solution-specific skills assessments that helped enterprise clients tailor learning priorities. In 2024, Adobe elevated free online self-service learning to a 'core component' of Adobe Digital Learning Services, explicitly placing it on learning.adobe.com and reinforcing its role in supporting both individual users and enterprise clients, suggesting a strategic shift to leverage self-service learning as a foundational element of customer education and product adoption, complementing fee-based offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAnother key component of Adobe's strategy is developing a large partner ecosystem to expand the reach and breadth of Adobe solutions in the global marketplace. To assist partners in building their respective digital practices, Adobe Global Services provides a comprehensive set of deliverables through Adobe's Solution Partner Program. The breadth of services described in the program provides system integrators, agencies and regional partners the tools required to develop core capabilities for positioning and  building  with Adobe  technology,  as  well  as  implementing  and  running  customer  platforms.  We  believe  that  through  these programmatic services and support, our joint customers benefit greatly from the combination of Adobe technology and the deep customer context that our global partners represent.\n\n## Customer Success Account Management\n\nAdobe Customer Solutions provides Customer Success Managers, who work with enterprise and commercial customers on an  ongoing  basis  to  understand  their  current  and  future  business  needs,  promote  faster  solution  adoption  and  align  product capabilities  to  customers'  business  objectives  to  maximize  the  return  on  their  investment  in  Adobe's  offerings.  We  engage customers to share innovative best practices, relevant industry and vertical knowledge and proven success strategies based on our extensive engagements with leading marketers and brands. The performance of these teams is directly associated with customerfocused outcomes.\n\n## Technical Support\n\nAdobe provides enterprise maintenance and support services to customers of subscription products as part of the subscription entitlement and to perpetual license customers via annual fee-based maintenance and support programs. These offerings provide customers with:\n\n- technical support on the products customers have purchased from Adobe;\n- 'how to' help in using our products; and\n- product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support or subscription period, which is typically one to three years.\n\nWe provide  product  support  through  our  support  organization  that  includes  several  regional  and  global  support  centers, supplemented with outsourced vendors for specific services. Customers can seek help through multiple channels including phone, chat, web, social media and email, allowing quick and easy access to the information they need. These teams are responsible for providing timely, high-quality technical expertise on all our products.\n\nCertain consumers are eligible to receive Getting Started support, to assist with easy adoption of their products. Support for some products and in some countries may vary. For enterprise customers with greater support needs, we offer personalized service options  through  Premium  Services  options,  delivered  by  global  support  centers  and  technical  account  managers  who  can  also provide proactive risk mitigation services and on-site support services for those with business-critical deployments.\n\nWe also offer delivery assurance, technical support and enablement services to partners and developer organizations. We provide developers with high-quality tools, software development kits, information and services.\n\n## Digital Learning Services\n\nAdobe Customer Solutions offers a comprehensive portfolio of learning and enablement services to assist our customer and partner teams in the use of our products, including those within Digital Experience, Digital Media and other legacy products and solutions. Our training portfolio includes a large number of free online self-service learning options on www.training.adobe.com. Adobe  Digital  Learning  Services  also  has  an  extensive  portfolio  of  fee-based  learning  programs  including  a  wide  range  of traditional classroom, virtual and on-demand training and certifications delivered by our team of training professionals and partners across the globe.\n\nThese core offerings are complemented by our custom learning services, which support our largest enterprise customers and their unique requirements. Solution-specific skills assessments help our enterprise customers objectively assess the knowledge and competencies within their marketing teams and tailor their learning priorities accordingly.\n\n## Investments\n\nFrom time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter into these investments with the intent of  securing  financial  returns  as  well  as  for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  emerging  markets  and technologies and expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services.",

We enter these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  technological  developments  in  the  industry  and  ex pand  our  opportunities  to  provide Adobe products, services, and solutions.\n\n## RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT\n\nWith the speed of innovation and technological change that characterizes the software industry, a continuous high level of investment is required for the research and development of the cutting-edge technologies that lead to the development of new products, services and solutions and the continual enhancement of existing products, services and solutions. Our Adobe Research team of research scientists, engineers, artists and designers help turn ideas into technologies that power the future of our products, services and solutions. We are investing, and intend to continue to invest, in research and development to strengthen our existing products, services and solutions, and to expand our offerings across our clouds and the next generation of AI, machine learning and deep learning-driven tools and features to solve problems in areas such as content understanding and generation, recommendations, personalization and more.\n\nIn addition to our own research and development, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe  protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign  intellectual  property  laws, confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and  pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile Apps to users and customers under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  and  customers  under  'click  through'  or  signed  agreements containing  restrictions  on  access  and  use.  Our  enterprise  customers  license  our  hosted  offerings  as  SaaS  or  Managed  Services  via  agreements  based  on  our enterprise licensing terms.\n\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop Apps with the same functionality as our Apps. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.",

In 2022, Document Cloud was grouped under legacy offerings within a diverse set of products like eLearning, web conferencing, and Adobe Advertising Cloud, indicating a less differentiated role in Adobe\u2019s portfolio. By 2023, Adobe began emphasizing Document Cloud as a core component of its Digital Media segment, alongside Creative Cloud, signaling a shift toward positioning it as a central productivity tool. In 2024, Adobe significantly expanded Document Cloud\u2019s capabilities by integrating AI-powered workflows (e.g., Firefly generative AI features), introducing enterprise API services, and highlighting its integration with third-party productivity apps. This evolution reflects Adobe\u2019s strategy to elevate Document Cloud from a supporting legacy product to a modern, AI-enhanced, and enterprise-ready platform.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of long-term debt instruments, specifically the 3.700% Notes due 2046, evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this consistent inclusion reveal about the company's long-term capital strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's 3.700% Notes due 2046 were consistently referenced across all three fiscal years (2022, 2023, and 2024) as part of the company's Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. The notes remained a stable component of Microsoft's long-term debt structure, indicating a consistent capital financing strategy focused on maintaining diversified and long-dated debt instruments to support strategic initiatives and financial flexibility.",

        "Hop 1: [MSFT](2022) \u2192 [3.700% Notes due 2046]: Microsoft references the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, which includes the 3.700% Notes due 2046 among other long-term debt instruments.",
        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [3.700% Notes due 2046]: The 3.700% Notes due 2046 are again listed under the same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, showing no structural change in the debt instrument.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [3.700% Notes due 2046]: In the 2024 filing, the 3.700% Notes due 2046 continue to be listed under the same indenture, confirming sustained inclusion in Microsoft's long-term debt portfolio."

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of 2.000% Notes due in 2023 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern indicate about the company's debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 2.000% Notes due 2023 in its filings across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating ongoing acknowledgment of this debt obligation. The Eleventh Supplemental Indenture related to these notes, dated August 8, 2016, was included in all three years' filings. This consistency suggests that Microsoft maintained its long-term debt structure without refinancing or retiring the 2.000% Notes due 2023 during this period, reflecting a stable approach to its fixed-income liabilities.",

        "Hop 1: [MSFT](2022) \u2192 [2.000% Notes due 2023]: Microsoft referenced the 2.000% Notes due 2023 in its 2022 10-K filing, specifically tied to the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016.",
        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [2.000% Notes due 2023]: In the 2023 10-K filing, Microsoft again referenced the 2.000% Notes due 2023 under the same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [2.000% Notes due 2023]: Microsoft continued to reference the 2.000% Notes due 2023 in its 2024 10-K filing, again citing the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture from August 8, 2016."

      "question": "How did Microsoft's disclosure of its 4.000% Notes due 2021 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this consistency or change suggest about the company's long-term debt structure and refinancing strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's disclosure of the 4.000% Notes due 2021 remained consistent across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, with the notes always appearing in the Third Supplemental Indenture (Exhibit 4.6) and linked to the original Indenture dated May 18, 2009. This consistency suggests that the company maintained the same legal and structural documentation for this debt instrument throughout the three-year period, indicating no material changes in its long-term debt obligations related to this issuance. The repeated inclusion of the same filing dates (e.g., 8-K filings on February 8, 2011) further supports that no refinancing or restructuring occurred for these notes during the observed timeframe.",

        "Hop 1: [MSFT](2022) \u2192 [4.000% Notes due 2021]: Disclosed in Exhibit 4.6 as part of the Third Supplemental Indenture dated February 8, 2011, incorporated under Form 8-K, indicating the structure and legal framework of the notes.",
        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [4.000% Notes due 2021]: Repeated the same Exhibit 4.6 with identical descriptions and filing references, showing no modifications to the notes or their indenture.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [4.000% Notes due 2021]: Again included Exhibit 4.6 with unchanged details, confirming that the structure and documentation remained constant through the end of the observation period."

      "question": "How did Microsoft's treatment of the 3.950% Notes due 2056 across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings reflect its approach to long-term debt maturity management and refinancing strategy over time?",
      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 3.950% Notes due 2056 in each of its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings as part of the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. The repeated inclusion of this long-term debt instrument across all three annual reports indicates that Microsoft maintained its commitment to this long-duration financing structure without modification or early redemption. This pattern suggests a deliberate strategy of preserving long-term capital stability by not altering or refinancing this specific tranche of debt, even as shorter-term instruments (e.g., 2.000% Notes due 2023 in 2022 filings and 2.400% Notes due 2026 in 2024) matured or approached maturity. The consistency in disclosure implies a strategic prioritization of long-dated liabilities to support long-term investment horizons, particularly during periods of evolving market interest rates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MSFT](2022) \u2192 [3.950% Notes due 2056]: Microsoft referenced the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, which included the 3.950% Notes due 2056, indicating the long-term debt was active and disclosed in the capital structure.",
        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [3.950% Notes due 2056]: The same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture was referenced in the 2023 filing, showing no change in the status of the 3.950% Notes due 2056, despite the maturity of other notes like the 2.000% Notes due 2023.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [3.950% Notes due 2056]: In the 2024 filing, the 3.950% Notes due 2056 remained part of the same Supplemental Indenture, with no indication of refinancing or redemption, even as newer notes like the 2.400% Notes due 2026 were highlighted."

      "question": "How did Microsoft's disclosure and treatment of its 2.125% Notes due 2021 evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this imply about the company's debt management or refinancing strategy for this instrument?",
      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 2.125% Notes due 2021 across its 10-K filings for fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating that the notes remained part of the company's active debt structure or disclosure obligations during this period despite their maturity in 2021. In the 2022 filing (MSFT_10k_2022.pdf, page 104), the notes were listed in Exhibit 4.10 under the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated December 6, 2013. In 2023 (MSFT_10k_2023.pdf, page 104), the notes were again included in Exhibit 4.1 with the same indenture date. In 2024 (MSFT_10k_2024.pdf, page 104), the notes were still referenced in Exhibit 4.1, indicating no change in their documentation status. This persistence of reference may suggest either an extension or rollover of the instrument, continued disclosure requirements for historical instruments, or a lack of updated exhibit filings. The continued listing of a note that matured in 2021 raises questions about whether Microsoft refinanced the obligation or if there is a reporting lag in removing matured instruments from exhibit disclosures.",

      "question": "As an investor analyzing Apple's capital structure, what does the consistent reference to Floating Rate Notes due 2019 in filings from 2022 through 2024 suggest about the company's long-term debt management and refinancing strategy?",
      "answer": "Apple's consistent reference to Floating Rate Notes due 2019 across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings indicates a deliberate and stable approach to managing its long-term debt obligations. Despite the maturity of these notes in 2019, Apple continued to disclose them in its filings through 2024, suggesting that these instruments may have been part of a broader, ongoing debt structure or refinancing plan. This pattern implies that Apple may have rolled over or repriced this debt into newer instruments while maintaining transparency around its historical debt instruments, reflecting a disciplined and predictable capital structure strategy.",

      "question": "What does the consistent inclusion of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in Apple's filings across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 suggest about the company's long-term debt structure and disclosure strategy for legacy instruments?",
      "answer": "Apple's 10-K filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024 all include Exhibit 4.3, which contains the Officer's Certificate dated May 3, 2013, detailing the 0.45% Notes due 2016 among other instruments. Despite the maturity of these notes in 2016, Apple continued to disclose this historical debt instrument across three consecutive annual reports. This pattern suggests that Apple maintains transparency around legacy debt structures, possibly to preserve a complete record of past financing activities for investor reference. The persistence of this disclosure, even after the notes' maturity, indicates a consistent approach to documenting capital structure history, rather than focusing solely on active obligations.",

      "question": "How did Apple's issuance of long-term debt instruments, specifically the 4.45% Notes due 2044, evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern indicate about Apple's long-term capital strategy?",
      "answer": "Apple consistently referenced the 4.45% Notes due 2044 in its filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating a sustained reliance on long-term debt instruments as part of its capital structure. The repeated inclusion of the Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014, which includes the 4.45% Notes due 2044, across all three years shows that Apple maintained this long-term liability on its books without early redemption or restructuring during the observed period. This consistent presence suggests a strategic decision to retain long-duration debt, possibly to manage interest rate risk and maintain financial flexibility over time.",

This static disclosure indicates that Apple did not modify or refinance this particular debt instrument during this period, suggesting a passive management approach toward this specific short-term debt obligation. The consistency in reporting implies that Apple prioritized stability in its capital structure for this instrument, choosing not to adjust its terms or maturity despite evolving market conditions.",

      "answer": "Apple first disclosed the 2.40% Notes due 2023 in its 2022 10-K filing as part of its Officer's Certificate dated May 3, 2013. The same disclosure was carried forward in both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, indicating no changes to the specific debt instrument's terms or status over the three-year period. This static disclosure suggests that Apple maintained a consistent approach to managing this particular debt obligation, with no early repayments, modifications, or extensions during the period. The lack of changes implies a stable long-term debt strategy for this instrument, with Apple likely planning to meet the 2023 maturity as originally structured.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, IBM consistently emphasized client relationships and trust as a core competitive differentiator, but the context and strategic framing evolved. In 2022, IBM highlighted trust as part of its hybrid cloud and AI platform, emphasizing its ability to integrate data, AI, and industry expertise. In 2023, the company expanded this by linking trust to its strategic partnerships, showing how it leverages alliances to deliver end-to-end solutions. By 2024, IBM reinforced trust as a foundational element in its go-to-market strategy, particularly in addressing complex business challenges through a broad ecosystem of partners. This indicates a strategic deepening of how IBM positions trust not just as a value proposition, but as an enabler of integrated, client-centric innovation.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 13.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 13 to 15.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 15 to 16.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our broad range of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we are optimizing our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations, shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into our offerings while building new solutions and modernizing our existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nWe differentiate from other providers, as our breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We leverage a flexible, secure, and open hybrid cloud platform and scale up solutions integrating (1) data, (2) AI for production and automation, (3) deep expertise in industries and business processes, (4) trust and security, along with (5) a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. All of these actions have positioned IBM for accelerated growth now with hybrid cloud and AI while preparing us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.\n\nAs we execute our strategy as a hybrid cloud and AI company, we are regularly exposed to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments.\n\nA summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:\n\n## Software:\n\nThe depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors.

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM referenced the 1.250% Notes due 2027 in its exhibit list as part of a broader set of instruments, specifically noting that the rights of holders were defined in Exhibit 4.3 to Form 8-K filed January 30, 2019. By 2023, the Notes were again referenced in a list that included a growing number of debt instruments, now tied to more recent filings such as February 8, 2022, indicating a broader and more complex debt structure. In 2024, the 1.250% Notes due 2027 were explicitly listed in the company's 10-K with a distinct trading symbol (IBM27B), showing they had become a formally recognized and actively traded financial instrument. This progression reflects IBM's increasing transparency and emphasis on this particular note within its capital structure.",

      "question": "How did IBM's disclosures around the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to the consistency of exhibit references and the broader context of IBM's debt instrument disclosures?",
      "answer": "IBM consistently referenced the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 as Exhibit 2 to Form 8-K, filed on January 8, 1998, across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024), indicating no changes in the documentation defining the rights of the holders of these debentures. However, the broader context of IBM's debt disclosures evolved subtly over time. In 2022, the debentures were listed among a wider range of debt instruments, including newer notes due in 2022, 2023, 2024, and beyond, with detailed exhibit references for each. By 2023 and 2024, the disclosures focused more on integrating legacy debt (like the 6.50% Debentures due 2028) alongside newer instruments such as the 6.22% Debentures due 2027 and 5.875% Debentures due 2032, suggesting a continued emphasis on long-term debt management and investor clarity. This consistency in exhibit referencing for the 6.50% Debentures due 2028, despite the broader evolution in debt disclosures, likely supports regulatory compliance and investor understanding of IBM's long-standing obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed the existence of the 0.950% Notes due 2025 as part of its long-term debt obligations in its 10-K filing, referencing the instruments defining the rights of the holders through Exhibit 4.1 to Form 8-K filed on May 22, 2017. In 2023, IBM reaffirmed the ongoing relevance of these notes by reiterating their inclusion in the company's debt structure, again citing the same filing (May 22, 2017) as the source of the instrument defining holders' rights. By 2024, the 0.950% Notes due 2025 had transitioned from being a disclosed obligation to a publicly traded instrument, as evidenced by its listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol IBM25B. This progression illustrates IBM\u2019s strategic movement from internal documentation and disclosure to active capital market engagement with this debt instrument.",

      "question": "How did IBM's exposure to stock exchange regulations evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to its debt and equity securities, and what does this multi-year progression reveal about its capital market risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM highlighted that its debt and equity securities were subject to fluctuations influenced by stock exchange regulations, among other external factors, with no direct control over these risks. In 2023, the company reiterated similar exposure, particularly emphasizing the impact of regulatory and exchange controls on debt securities and the volatility of common stock prices due to speculative and geopolitical factors. By 2024, IBM expanded on this by detailing how stock exchange regulations were part of a broader set of capital market risks, including liquidity conditions, credit risk on receivables, and pension-related financial pressures. The consistent framing of regulatory exposure across all three years suggests a stable risk profile, but the growing contextual complexity \u2014 especially in 2024 \u2014 indicates a more nuanced articulation of regulatory impact amid broader macroeconomic pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Item 2. Properties:\n\nIBM's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31, 2021, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 52 million square feet worldwide.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, IBM's facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 11 million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled nearly 32 million square feet, of which 7 million was owned and 25 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company's cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments.\n\nContinuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations.\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings:\n\nRefer to note S, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' on pages 113 to 115 of IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures:\n\nNot applicable.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities\n\nThe Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.",

      "question": "How did Apple's continued inclusion of Floating Rate Notes due 2019 in its debt disclosures from 2022 through 2024 reflect its approach to short-term interest rate risk management and liquidity planning?",
      "answer": "Apple consistently included Floating Rate Notes due 2019 in its debt disclosures across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024), indicating a deliberate and stable approach to managing short-term interest rate risk. The recurring appearance of these notes in the 10-K filings suggests that Apple maintained exposure to variable interest rates through these instruments, likely to align borrowing costs with current market conditions. This consistency implies that Apple's liquidity planning strategy relied on flexible debt instruments that could adapt to changing interest rate environments, without needing to issue new short-term floating rate instruments during this period. The company's approach reflects a cautious yet adaptive stance toward financing operations and capital returns while managing exposure to interest rate volatility.",

        "Hop 2: [AAPL](2024) \u2192 Floating Rate Notes due 2019: Again referenced in the 2024 10-K filing under Exhibit 4.4, showing sustained acknowledgment of these notes in Apple's capital structure despite the due date having passed, possibly indicating rollover or extended disclosure requirements.",
        "Hop 3: [AAPL](2022) \u2192 Floating Rate Notes due 2019: Explicitly listed in the 2022 10-K filing under Exhibit 4.4, confirming that Apple maintained visibility and disclosure continuity for these notes well after their maturity, suggesting strategic or compliance significance."

      "question": "How did Apple's issuance of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this pattern reveal about the company's long-term debt structuring strategy?",
      "answer": "Apple first disclosed the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its 2022 10-K filing as part of a broader set of global notes issued under an Officer's Certificate dated May 3, 2013. The same disclosure was repeated in both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, indicating that the company maintained this debt instrument as part of its capital structure across all three years. The consistent inclusion of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in each annual report suggests a stable long-term debt strategy, with Apple preserving a mix of older, lower-yield debt instruments alongside newer issuances.",

      "question": "What was the status of Apple's 1.05% Notes due 2017 across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and how does the continued reference to these notes in disclosures reflect Apple's approach to managing maturing debt instruments?",
      "answer": "Apple's 1.05% Notes due 2017 were referenced consistently across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 in its 10-K filings, despite the notes having matured in 2017. In 2022, the notes were listed in Exhibit 4.4 as part of the Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014. In 2023, the same notes were again included in Exhibit 4.4 with identical language. In 2024, Apple continued to reference the 1.05% Notes due 2017 in the same exhibit, indicating no change in disclosure strategy. This pattern suggests that Apple may have retained historical references to these notes as part of a standardized disclosure framework, possibly to maintain continuity in its debt documentation or to reflect refinancing activities, though no explicit updates were provided in any of the three years.",

        "Hop 1: [AAPL](2023) \u2192 [1.05% Notes due 2017]: Listed in Exhibit 4.4 with no update since 2014, indicating legacy disclosure.",
        "Hop 2: [AAPL](2024) \u2192 [1.05% Notes due 2017]: Still referenced in Exhibit 4.4, showing no removal despite maturity in 2017.",
        "Hop 3: [AAPL](2022) \u2192 [1.05% Notes due 2017]: Included in Exhibit 4.4, confirming consistent inclusion across all three years."

      "answer": "Apple's treatment of the 2.40% Notes due 2023 remained consistent across all three fiscal years: the notes were referenced in each year's filing (2022: Exhibit 4.3, 2023: Exhibit 4.3, 2024: Exhibit 4.3), indicating no refinancing or retirement occurred during this period. Despite the notes maturing in 2023, Apple continued to disclose them in both the 2023 and 2024 filings, suggesting a practice of maintaining transparency around legacy debt instruments even after maturity. This consistency in disclosure implies a deliberate approach to capital structure reporting, ensuring stakeholders can track obligations through their full lifecycle, including post-maturity resolution.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's strategic focus and financial commitment to 5G technologies evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of licensing revenue, investment in new applications, and exposure to geopolitical risks?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Qualcomm highlighted 5G as a foundational enabler of immersive mobile experiences and a catalyst for growth in IoT and automotive applications, projecting over 27 billion IoT devices by 2026. By fiscal 2023, the company emphasized increased R&D investments in 5G and next-generation wireless technologies, while also noting growing geopolitical risks, including the revocation of export licenses to Huawei, which had contributed $560 million in fiscal 2024 prior to the ban. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm underscored its leadership in 5G intellectual property and licensing, with the majority of QTL revenues derived from OFDMA-based (including 5G) devices, and expanded its strategic investments in 5G-enabled sectors like AI, automotive, and IoT through Qualcomm Ventures. This progression shows a deepening financial and strategic commitment to 5G despite rising external risks.",

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

          "chunk_text": "- Intel 4, our first EUV  lithography  node, deliv ers significant density  scaling and approx imately  20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n- Intel 3, our second EUV  lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel's X eon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.\n- Intel 18A  is our nex t generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A  is offered to ex ternal foundry  customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A , in 2025.\n- Intel 14A , our third adv anced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A.\n\n## IP Rights\n\nWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.\n\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly  in countries that prov ide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmoniz ed international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.\n\n## Manufacturing Capital\n\nWe are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.\n\n## Process Technology\n\nOur technology development group, with its R&amp;D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before high-volume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and siz e to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

      "question": "How did Intel's use of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of the types of equity awards granted and their vesting conditions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel referenced the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan primarily for strategic growth performance-based RSUs and stock options, including specific agreements for executives and non-employee directors. By 2023, the company amended and restated the plan, effective May 11, 2023, and introduced a broader range of RSU agreements, including those with retirement vesting terms, without retirement vesting terms, and performance-based RSUs for both grandfathered and non-grandfathered executives. In 2024, the plan continued to be referenced for similar types of RSUs, but there was a noticeable consolidation in the documentation structure, with a focus on performance-based RSUs for grandfathered executives and a streamlined format for grant agreements. This evolution indicates a shift toward more nuanced performance alignment and simplified documentation over time.",

      "question": "How did Intel's strategic positioning and execution risks related to Advanced Packaging Technologies evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of R&D investment, manufacturing complexity, and financial impact?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Intel's strategic focus on Advanced Packaging Technologies intensified as part of its IDM 2.0 strategy, but execution risks and financial pressures grew. In 2022, Intel acknowledged the complexity and cost of deploying advanced packaging in disaggregated designs, citing delays in Intel 4 and 10nm processes. In 2023, the company positioned its advanced packaging capabilities as a competitive differentiator, especially for AI-driven systems of chips, and demonstrated the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) standard in silicon. However, by 2024, Intel faced significant financial strain, with $3.1 billion in non-cash impairments tied to Intel 7, and delays in global manufacturing projects, casting doubt on its ability to scale advanced packaging capacity profitably. The trend shows an initial strategic bet, followed by technical progress, but ultimately financial and operational setbacks.",

          "chunk_text": "Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n\nWe invest significantly in R&amp;D, and to the extent our R&amp;D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

We also named our new CFO David Zinsner in January 2022. Mr. Gelsinger returns to Intel, where he previously spent 30 years of his career, learned at the feet of Intel's founders, and served as our first Chief Technology Officer.\n\n## IDM 2.0\n\nOn March 23, 2021, we announced our \"IDM 2.0\" strategy, the next evolution of our IDM model. Our IDM 2.0 strategy combines our internal factory network, strategic use of external foundries, and our new IFS business to position us to drive technology and product leadership. To accelerate this strategy, we announced plans to invest $20 billion to build two new fabs in Arizona, which we broke ground on in September, and we recently announced plans to invest more than $20 billion in the construction of two new leading-edge fabs in Ohio. We also announced approximately $10.5 billion total investment to equip our Rio Rancho, New Mexico and Malaysia sites for advanced packaging manufacturing. In August, the US Department of Defense announced that IFS will lead the first phase of its multi-phase RAMP-C program to facilitate the use of a domestic commercial foundry infrastructure.\n\n## Process and packaging technology roadmaps\n\nAt the Intel Accelerated event in July 2021, we provided an update on our manufacturing process and packaging technology roadmaps. We introduced future nodes, including Intel 3 and Intel 20A, and discussed future process and packaging technologies, such as our PowerVia, RibbonFET, Foveros Omni, and Foveros Direct technologies. As part of the update, we also introduced a new naming structure for our manufacturing process nodes, which includes the name changes summarized in \"Key Terms\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 12th Gen Intel  Core\u2122 processors \u00ae\n\nWe announced the 12th Gen Intel Core processor family (Alder Lake), the first on the Intel 7 process, with real-world performance for enthusiast gamers and professional creators.

          "chunk_text": "- Intel 4, our first EUV  lithography  node, deliv ers significant density  scaling and approx imately  20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n- Intel 3, our second EUV  lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel's X eon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.\n- Intel 18A  is our nex t generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A  is offered to ex ternal foundry  customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A , in 2025.\n- Intel 14A , our third adv anced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A.\n\n## IP Rights\n\nWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.\n\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly  in countries that prov ide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmoniz ed international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.\n\n## Manufacturing Capital\n\nWe are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.\n\n## Process Technology\n\nOur technology development group, with its R&amp;D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before high-volume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and siz e to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

      "question": "How did Intel's Sheltered Employee Retirement Plan Plus evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of amendments related to plan structure and effective dates, and what does this progression suggest about Intel's long-term employee benefits strategy?",
      "answer": "Intel's Sheltered Employee Retirement Plan Plus was initially introduced in the 2022 filings with an effective date of January 1, 2020, indicating a foundational step in formalizing this retirement benefit. In 2023, the filings referenced a Second Amendment to the plan, dated January 1, 2023, which suggests Intel was actively refining the plan's structure or eligibility criteria within two years of its introduction. By 2024, the filings not only reiterated the original plan but also explicitly formalized the January 1, 2023 amendment, signaling a deliberate, multi-year effort to stabilize and institutionalize this benefit offering. This progression implies that Intel is strategically enhancing its long-term employee benefits framework, potentially to improve talent retention and align with broader workforce planning goals.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel referenced multiple grant agreements under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, including forms of Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) and Stock Option Grant Agreements for executives, non-employee directors, and performance-based awards. In 2023, the company filed an amended and restated version of the plan effective May 11, 2023, continuing to reference specific RSU grant agreements with retirement vesting terms and performance-based RSUs. By 2024, Intel continued to rely on the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, with filings showing ongoing use of standardized RSU grant agreements and notices of grant, indicating sustained reliance on the plan despite its age. The evolution shows a consistent but increasingly mature application of the plan, with formal amendments in 2023 reflecting structural updates.",

      "question": "How did Intel's investment and strategic positioning in advanced packaging technologies evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year trajectory reveal about its ability to execute on the IDM 2.0 strategy amid manufacturing delays and capital constraints?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel acknowledged the complexity and risk in deploying advanced packaging technologies as part of its disaggregated design approach, citing delays in process technologies like Intel 4 (formerly 7nm) and the increased costs and design challenges associated with advanced packaging. By 2023, Intel positioned its advanced packaging capabilities as a competitive differentiator under the IDM 2.0 strategy, highlighting 2D and 2.5D/3D packaging solutions and the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) standard, which was demonstrated in silicon that year. However, by 2024, despite R&D investments (e.g., $16.5 billion in 2024), Intel faced delays in product introductions (e.g., 4th Gen Xeon Scalable processors) and significant non-cash impairments ($3.1 billion in Q3 2024), particularly affecting the Intel 7 process node. This trajectory shows that while Intel made strategic progress in packaging innovation, execution challenges and capital constraints undermined its ability to consistently deliver on the IDM 2.0 roadmap.",

          "chunk_text": "Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n\nWe invest significantly in R&amp;D, and to the extent our R&amp;D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed the 1.250% Notes due 2027 as part of its incorporated exhibits, indicating internal documentation and legal structure but no active market listing. By 2023, IBM continued to disclose the instrument in filings, reaffirming its legal terms and incorporation by reference, but still without evidence of a public listing. In 2024, the 1.250% Notes due 2027 were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker IBM27B, marking a shift to public market accessibility and signaling a strategic move to make this debt instrument more visible and tradable. This evolution suggests that IBM transitioned the 1.250% Notes due 2027 from an internally held obligation to a publicly traded liability, likely to enhance liquidity or attract a broader investor base.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: IBM(2023) \u2192 1.250% Notes due 2027: The instrument is disclosed in filings with rights defined and incorporated by reference, indicating ongoing legal documentation but no market activity.",
        "Hop 2: IBM(2024) \u2192 1.250% Notes due 2027: The instrument appears as a listed security on the NYSE under the ticker IBM27B, showing active market participation and investor accessibility.",
        "Hop 3: IBM(2022) \u2192 1.250% Notes due 2027: The instrument is referenced as part of the incorporated exhibits, showing that the debt was recognized and documented but not yet publicly traded."

      "question": "How did IBM's presentation and contextual disclosure of its 6.50% Debentures due 2028 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, and what might this consistency or change suggest about its approach to communicating legacy debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Across the 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, IBM consistently referenced the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 with the same exhibit details \u2014 Exhibit 2 to Form 8-K, filed on January 8, 1998. However, the formatting and placement of this disclosure varied slightly: in 2022, it was listed among a broader set of notes and instruments, while in 2023 and 2024, it appeared in a more standardized, repetitive format alongside other debentures. This suggests that IBM maintained a consistent reference point for the instrument defining the rights of debenture holders but may have shifted toward a more streamlined or templated disclosure approach over time, potentially to improve clarity or align with evolving SEC presentation standards. The lack of substantive changes in disclosure language indicates a stable treatment of this legacy debt instrument, signaling no immediate strategic shift in how IBM communicates its long-term obligations.",

        "Hop 1: IBM(2023) \u2192 6.50% Debentures due 2028: The 2023 filing explicitly references the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 as Exhibit 2 to Form 8-K filed on January 8, 1998, maintaining continuity in documentation.",
        "Hop 2: IBM(2024) \u2192 6.50% Debentures due 2028: The 2024 filing mirrors the 2023 disclosure, again listing the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 as Exhibit 2 to Form 8-K filed on January 8, 1998, with only minor formatting differences.",
        "Hop 3: IBM(2022) \u2192 6.50% Debentures due 2028: In 2022, the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 were also referenced as Exhibit 2 to Form 8-K filed on January 8, 1998, but appeared in a more detailed and varied list that included several other notes and instruments."

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed the instrument defining the rights of the holders of the 0.950% Notes due 2025, referencing Exhibit 4.1 to Form 8-K filed May 22, 2017. In 2023, IBM again referenced the same instrument in its disclosures, indicating ongoing transparency and regulatory continuity around this debt instrument. By 2024, the 0.950% Notes due 2025 were actively listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol IBM25B, showing that the instrument remained a live and traded financial liability for IBM. This 3-year progression reflects a consistent disclosure framework and sustained presence of the 0.950% Notes in IBM's capital structure, suggesting a stable and transparent debt management strategy around this specific instrument.",

      "question": "How did Apple's inclusion of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its annual filings evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this pattern indicate about the company's ongoing obligations and disclosures related to legacy debt instruments?",
      "answer": "Apple consistently included the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its annual filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating sustained disclosure obligations for this legacy debt instrument despite its maturity date being in the past. This consistent inclusion suggests that Apple maintained transparency around its historical debt structure, possibly due to ongoing legal or reporting requirements tied to the notes.",

        "Hop 2: AAPL(2023) \u2192 0.45% Notes due 2016: In the 2023 10-K filing, the 0.45% Notes due 2016 were again referenced in Exhibit 4.3, showing Apple maintained documentation and disclosure of this instrument into a second consecutive year.",
        "Hop 3: AAPL(2024) \u2192 0.45% Notes due 2016: The 0.45% Notes due 2016 were once again included in Exhibit 4.3 of Apple\u2019s 2024 10-K filing, demonstrating a three-year pattern of consistent inclusion, suggesting a formalized, ongoing disclosure requirement."

      "question": "How did Apple's long-term debt structure evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024 with respect to its 4.45% Notes due 2044, and what does this reveal about the company's ongoing financing strategy?",
      "answer": "Apple first disclosed the 4.45% Notes due 2044 in its 2014 Officer's Certificate (filed in 2014 and referenced in all three filings), indicating a long-standing commitment to this debt instrument. Across 2022, 2023, and 2024, Apple consistently included the 4.45% Notes due 2044 in its list of issued securities, showing no changes in the structure or terms of this specific note over the three-year period. However, the continued reference to this note across all filings suggests that Apple has maintained this long-term debt obligation as a stable component of its capital structure, indicating a strategy of relying on fixed long-term financing for major corporate initiatives. The absence of modifications or early redemptions of the 4.45% Notes due 2044 across these years reflects a deliberate approach to managing long-term liabilities.",

      "question": "What does Apple's continued reference to the 1.05% Notes due 2017 in its filings through 2023 and 2024 indicate about its approach to debt disclosure, and how does this compare to its broader debt issuance strategy across 2022\u20132024?",
      "answer": "Apple's continued reference to the 1.05% Notes due 2017 in its 2023 and 2024 filings indicates a consistent and transparent approach to disclosing historical debt instruments, even after their maturity. This contrasts with Apple's broader strategy of issuing new debt instruments with varying maturities (e.g., Floating Rate Notes due 2020, 2.15% Notes due 2022, and 3.45% Notes due 2024) across the three-year period. The persistence of the 1.05% Notes due 2017 in filings suggests that Apple maintains a comprehensive historical record of its capital structure, possibly for legal or investor transparency purposes, even as it actively manages and evolves its debt portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: [AAPL](2022) \u2192 [1.05% Notes due 2017]: The 1.05% Notes due 2017 are listed in the Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014, included in the 2022 filing, indicating historical debt disclosures are retained.",
        "Hop 2: [AAPL](2023) \u2192 [1.05% Notes due 2017]: The 1.05% Notes due 2017 continue to be referenced in the 2023 filing, despite having matured in 2017, showing sustained inclusion in capital structure documentation.",
        "Hop 3: [AAPL](2024) \u2192 [1.05% Notes due 2017]: The 2024 filing also retains the reference to the 1.05% Notes due 2017, demonstrating a long-standing disclosure practice, even as newer debt instruments like the 3.45% Notes due 2024 are introduced."

      "answer": "Intel first introduced PowerVia in 2022 as part of its updated manufacturing process and packaging technology roadmaps, positioning it alongside RibbonFET as a key innovation for future nodes. By 2023, Intel had solidified PowerVia\u2019s role within the Intel 20A node, describing it as an 'industry-first implementation of backside power delivery' designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating front-side power routing. In 2024, Intel canceled the productization of Intel 20A in favor of the improved Intel 18A, which retained PowerVia as a core feature and was slated for high-volume manufacturing in 2025 with the Panther Lake client processor family. This evolution shows that PowerVia transitioned from a roadmap concept to a foundational element of Intel\u2019s leading-edge process technology, underscoring its strategic importance in achieving performance-per-watt improvements and maintaining competitive parity in advanced semiconductor manufacturing.",

          "chunk_text": "- Intel 4, our first EUV  lithography  node, deliv ers significant density  scaling and approx imately  20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n- Intel 3, our second EUV  lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel's X eon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.\n- Intel 18A  is our nex t generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A  is offered to ex ternal foundry  customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A , in 2025.\n- Intel 14A , our third adv anced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A.\n\n## IP Rights\n\nWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.\n\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly  in countries that prov ide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmoniz ed international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.\n\n## Manufacturing Capital\n\nWe are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.\n\n## Process Technology\n\nOur technology development group, with its R&amp;D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before high-volume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and siz e to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Intel's strategic emphasis on Advanced Packaging Technologies grew significantly as a core differentiator within its IDM 2.0 and foundry strategy. In 2022, Intel acknowledged the complexity and cost of implementing advanced packaging within its disaggregated design approach, citing delays and increased R&D costs. In 2023, the company highlighted its progress in developing 2D and 2.5D/3D packaging solutions and demonstrated the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) standard in silicon, positioning it as a unique advantage in the AI-driven chip market. However, by 2024, Intel faced mounting financial pressure, including a $3.1 billion impairment charge tied to manufacturing assets, and admitted that the execution risks in deploying novel packaging technologies were contributing to delays in product introductions and higher-than-anticipated costs. The trajectory shows a shift from strategic optimism to operational and financial strain around advanced packaging execution.",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

          "chunk_text": "Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n\nWe invest significantly in R&amp;D, and to the extent our R&amp;D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments.

Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

      "answer": "Accenture's target asset allocation mix for defined benefit pension plans showed a strategic shift over the three-year period. In fiscal 2023 (disclosed in the 2022 filing), the target allocation was based on a long-term return objective that exceeded inflation, with a significant portion invested in bonds and a smaller proportion in equities, especially in certain countries where regulatory requirements dictated investment strategy. By fiscal 2024 (disclosed in the 2023 filing), the company maintained its focus on diversified portfolios of fixed income and equities, with an emphasis on aligning debt securities' duration to plan liabilities and using equities for long-term capital appreciation. In fiscal 2025 (disclosed in the 2024 filing), the target allocation continued to prioritize risk-adjusted returns, with a focus on matching debt securities to liability duration and maintaining diversified equity exposure. The consistent emphasis on diversification and risk-adjusted returns, despite evolving market conditions, suggests a stable long-term investment strategy aimed at minimizing asset volatility relative to liabilities.",

      "question": "How did Accenture's share repurchase activity and remaining authorization evolve from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern indicate about the company's capital return strategy?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Accenture had $3,129,296 thousand (approximately $3.13 billion) in aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions. By fiscal 2024, this available authorization had decreased to $2,694 million, despite an additional $4,000 million in repurchase authority approved in September 2024, bringing total outstanding authority to $6,694 million. During fiscal 2024 alone, Accenture purchased 2,000,308 Class A ordinary shares for $605 million under its open-market program, in addition to 72,255 shares acquired through employee-related transactions. The 2023 filing appears to contain a forward-looking disclosure about fiscal 2024 activity, suggesting consistent messaging around repurchase levels and strategic intent. This pattern indicates a sustained but measured capital return strategy, with periodic replenishment of repurchase authority to maintain flexibility.",

Each ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc; however a holder of an ordinary share is not entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc or to receive dividends.\n\n## Class A Ordinary Shares\n\nAn Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc's Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.\n\n## Class X Ordinary Shares\n\nMost of our pre-incorporation partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. An Accenture plc Class X ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A Class X ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.\n\n## Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares\n\n## Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares\n\nPre-incorporation partners resident in Canada and New Zealand received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. We may, at our option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.

      "question": "How did Accenture's strategy for addressing revenue risks from technological disruption through pricing model innovation change between 2022 and 2024, and what were the strategic implications for the company's growth trajectory?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Accenture identified the risk of revenue disruption due to technological developments like cloud and as-a-service solutions, noting that clients were delaying spending under existing contracts while evaluating new technologies. The company emphasized the need to introduce new pricing models that reflect the value of these developments. By 2023, the risk narrative evolved to include AI and data-driven solutions as key disruptors, with Accenture highlighting the need to invest in AI-based services and solutions to maintain leadership and offset revenue shortfalls from automation replacing traditional services. In 2024, the company shifted toward a more strategic and proactive posture, emphasizing innovation through acquisitions, joint ventures, and adjacencies to expand into new growth areas. This evolution shows Accenture's transition from a reactive stance in 2022\u2014where the focus was on mitigating client spending delays\u2014to a more forward-looking investment strategy by 2024, aimed at transforming disruption into growth opportunities. The strategic implications include increased exposure to AI-related risks but also greater potential for scalable, tech-enabled revenue streams.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ACN(2022) \u2192 New Pricing Models: Accenture identified the risk of technological developments (e.g., cloud and as-a-service solutions) causing clients to delay spending, requiring new pricing models to reflect the value of these innovations.",
        "Hop 2: ACN(2023) \u2192 New Pricing Models: AI and data solutions were explicitly named as disruptors, with Accenture acknowledging that automation would reduce demand for traditional services and emphasizing the need to invest in AI-based offerings to offset revenue shortfalls.",
        "Hop 3: ACN(2024) \u2192 New Pricing Models: Accenture shifted toward a more strategic investment-driven approach, focusing on acquisitions, joint ventures, and adjacencies to expand into new growth areas and transform disruption into scalable revenue opportunities."

          "chunk_text": "Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud and as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead",

In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information.
