      "question": "How did Linde's contractual structure and pricing mechanisms for atmospheric gases evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to on-site customer agreements and variable pricing components?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde maintained a consistent focus on long-term on-site contracts for atmospheric gases, typically ranging from 10\u201320 years, with minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. However, in 2023, the company explicitly noted that pricing in these contracts fluctuates with various price indices and that variable components of consideration are present but constrained. This clarification around variable pricing was not detailed in 2022. By 2024, the structure remained largely unchanged, but the documentation reinforced the application of the practical expedient for measuring progress toward performance obligations, aligning revenue recognition with invoicing rights. This 3-year progression reveals a growing emphasis on transparency in pricing mechanisms and contract performance under ASC 606, especially regarding how Linde manages revenue variability in long-term on-site contracts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [LIN](2022) \u2192 [Atmospheric Gases]: Linde describes atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) as primary products sold through on-site, merchant, or packaged methods. On-site contracts are long-term (10\u201320 years) with minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions, though no explicit mention of price indices or variable pricing constraints is made.",
        "Hop 2: [LIN](2023) \u2192 [Atmospheric Gases]: The 2023 report expands on on-site contracts, specifying that pricing fluctuates with various price indices and that variable components of consideration exist but are considered constrained, indicating a more detailed disclosure of pricing mechanisms.",
        "Hop 3: [LIN](2024) \u2192 [Atmospheric Gases]: In 2024, Linde reiterates the 10\u201320 year contract terms and reinforces the use of the practical expedient for performance obligations, aligning revenue recognition with invoicing rights, showing a maturation in ASC 606 compliance and internal performance tracking."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

      "question": "How did Linde's production and strategic positioning around rare gases evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its technological differentiation and integration with other product lines?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde's production and strategic emphasis on rare gases evolved significantly. In 2022, rare gases were listed among Linde\u2019s primary atmospheric gases, produced via air separation and distributed through the company\u2019s three core methods\u2014on-site, merchant, and packaged. By 2023, the company maintained its focus on rare gases as part of its atmospheric gas portfolio but began to emphasize its proprietary technologies and long-term contracts, particularly in the on-site segment, which often included price escalation clauses and variable pricing. In 2024, Linde elevated its strategic positioning by explicitly highlighting its leadership in non-cryogenic air separation technologies and its pioneering role in industrial gases, specifically noting rare gases like krypton, neon, and xenon as byproducts of air separation. Additionally, Linde underscored its technological innovations such as VPSA and membrane separation, which enabled more efficient on-site delivery and broader market expansion. This progression reflects a shift from a product-centric to a technology- and integration-driven approach in the rare gases segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1.     BUSINE SS\n\n## General\n\nLinde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland with its principal offices in the United Kingdom and United States. Linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene, etc.). The company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\nLinde's sales were $33,005 million, $32,854 million, and $33,364 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde's reportable segments.\n\n## Industrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes\n\nAtmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using ambient air as feedstock, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Linde is the market leader in the field of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. As part of this process Linde also produces rare gases, such as krypton, neon, and xenon. As a pioneer and leader in industrial gases, Linde is continuously developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and technologies to produce, store, distribute and increase usage of its gases. These technologies open important new markets and provide customers with opportunities to reduce costs, by increasing their operational efficiencies, including vacuum pressure swing adsorption ('VPSA') and membrane separation technology to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen on-site.\n\nProcess gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by other production methods.\n\nHydrogen is produced from a range of different feedstocks using a wide portfolio of technologies. Today, carbon intensity is used to designate and differentiate between the production processes and the respective feedstocks used to produce the molecule. The majority of conventional hydrogen currently produced by Linde is derived from natural gas or methane, using steam methane reformation (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) technology. Linde has a range of technologies to produce low-carbon hydrogen from fossil feedstocks, or renewable hydrogen from renewable energy (non-fossil feedstock). Both products are considered sources of clean energy. Low-carbon (blue) hydrogen is produced primarily from methane, by capturing carbon emissions from a hydrogen production plant and sequestering them subsurface for the long term. Renewable (green) hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy and water as feedstock. Other sources of lowcarbon hydrogen are existing chemical and petrochemical processes, out of which Linde recovers hydrogen for subsequent treatment and cleaning to achieve ultrahigh purity levels.\n\nCarbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of natural gas or other feedstock such as naphtha, a by-product  in  the  petrochemical  industry.  Most  carbon  diox ide  comes  as  an  industrial  by-product,  that  is  sourced  from  chemical  plants,  refineries  and  other processes or is recovered from natural carbon dioxide sources. Raw carbon dioxide is processed and purified in Linde's plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Helium is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water.\n\n## Industrial Gases Distribution\n\nThere are three basic distribution  methods  for  industrial  gases:  (i)  on-site  or  tonnage;  (ii)  merchant  or  bulk  liquid;  and  (iii)  packaged  or  cylinder  gases.  These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer's needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).\n\n## Linde plc and Subsidiaries\n\n## PART I",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde consistently highlighted cultural challenges as a key risk in acquisition integration, but the depth and framing of the discussion evolved. In 2022, cultural challenges were listed among several integration risks, specifically tied to integrating employees from acquired companies and managing differences in operations across borders. By 2023, the company expanded on these concerns by emphasizing the broader context of global regulatory and compliance risks, indicating a more strategic awareness of how cultural differences could compound legal and operational complexities. In 2024, cultural challenges were again mentioned, but with a sharper focus on the potential negative impact on financial results if integration efforts fail to achieve synergies and retain key personnel. This progression shows that while cultural integration remained a persistent concern, Linde increasingly framed it in terms of strategic risk management and financial outcomes rather than just operational hurdles.",

These failures and breaches could result in business interruption or malfunction and lead to legal or regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on Linde's operations, reputation and financial results. To date, such attempts have not had any significant impact on Linde's operations or financial results.\n\n## The inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact Linde's financial position and results of operations.\n\nLinde has evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. Many of these transactions, if consummated, could be material to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company, business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Although historically Linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution, the areas where Linde may face risks include:\n\n- the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n- diversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenges;\n- cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the existing organization;\n- the need to integrate each company's accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management;\n- difficulty with the assimilation of acquired operations and products;\n- failure to achieve targeted synergies and cost reductions; and\n- inability to retain key employees and business relationships of acquired companies.\n\nForeign acquisitions and joint ventures involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned herein, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\n\nAlso, the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairments of goodwill, any of which could adversely impact Linde's financial results.\n\n## Linde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with, these laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company's business, financial position and results of operations.\n\nLinde is subject to regulations in the following areas, among others:\n\n- environmental protection, including climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies;\n- U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and currency controls;\n- safety;\n- securities laws applicable in the United States, the European Union, Germany, Ireland, and other jurisdictions;\n- trade and import/export restrictions, as well as economic sanctions laws;\n- antitrust matters;\n- data protection;\n- global anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n- healthcare regulations.\n\nChanges in these or other regulatory areas may impact Linde's profitability and may give rise to new or increased compliance risks: it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance, and the level of sanctions in the event of non-compliance may rise. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or sanctions, cancellation of marketing rights or restrictions on participation in, or even exclusion from, public tender proceedings, all of which could have a material adverse impact on Linde's financial results and/or reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndevelopment activities do not keep pace with competitors or if Linde does not create new technologies that benefit customers, future results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to pension benefit plans may adversely impact Linde's results of operations and cash flows.\n\nPension benefits represent significant financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities  related  to  Linde's  plans.  Linde  utilizes  the  services  of  independent  actuaries,  whose  models  are  used  to  facilitate  these  calculations.  Several  key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets, discount rates, or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions.\n\n## Operational risks may adversely impact Linde's business or results of operations.\n\nLinde's operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer contract requirements and other needs. Insufficient or ex cess capacity threatens Linde's ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose Linde to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are also dependent on Linde's ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget and in accordance with performance requirements. Failure to do so may expose Linde's business to loss of revenue, potential litigation and loss of business reputation.\n\nAlso inherent in the management of Linde's production facilities and delivery systems, including storage, vehicle transportation and pipelines, are operational risks that  require  continuous  training,  oversight  and  control.  Material  operating  failures  at  production,  storage  facilities  or  pipelines,  including  fire,  tox ic  release  and explosions, or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, loss of production and/or extensive property damage, all of which may negatively impact Linde's financial results.\n\n## Linde may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\n\nLinde  relies  on  information  technology  systems  and  networks  for  business  and  operational  activities,  and  also  stores  and  processes  sensitive  business  and proprietary information in these systems and networks. These systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of security.\n\nLinde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery processes. Despite these steps, however, our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future will likely be subject to increasingly sophisticated  cyber  attacks. Operational failures and breaches of security from such attempts could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to Linde or our employees and customers or suppliers. These failures and breaches could result in business interruption or malfunction and lead to legal or regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on Linde's operations, reputation and financial results. To date, such attempts have not had any significant impact on Linde's operations or financial results.\n\n## The inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact Linde's financial position and results of operations.\n\nLinde  has  evaluated  and  expects  to  continue  to  evaluate,  a  wide  array  of  potential  strategic  acquisitions  and  joint  ventures.  Many  of  these  transactions,  if consummated, could be material to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company, business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Although historically Linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution, the areas where Linde may face risks include:\n\n- the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n- diversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenges;\n- cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the existing organization;\n- the need to integrate each company's accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management;\n- difficulty with the assimilation of acquired operations and products;\n- failure to achieve targeted synergies and cost reductions; and",

      "question": "How did Linde's production and supply strategy for Liquid Products evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of contract structure, geographic reach, and integration with on-site operations?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde's strategy for Liquid Products remained centered on merchant and on-site production, but evolved in geographic scope and integration with broader operations. In 2022, Linde emphasized that many cryogenic on-site plants also produced liquid products for the merchant market, with plants typically not dedicated to a single customer, and noted contract liabilities of $3,699 million. In 2023, the company reiterated the dual role of on-site plants in serving both dedicated and merchant markets and highlighted its international presence with 68% of sales outside the U.S. By 2024, Linde expanded its global reach further, with approximately 65% of sales still outside the U.S., and placed increased emphasis on integration with its Engineering business, particularly in hydrogen and clean energy applications. The company also maintained its focus on flexible contract structures, with merchant agreements typically lasting 3\u20137 years and on-site contracts spanning 10\u201320 years, showing a consistent yet evolving approach to supply chain integration and international diversification.",

          "chunk_text": "may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers  typically  have  no  involvement  in  these  activities.  Advanced  air  separation  processes  also  allow  on-site  delivery  to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation  and  recognizes  revenue  as  the  company  has  the  right  to  invoice  each  customer,  which  generally  corresponds  with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates  with  various  price  indices.  Variable  components  of  consideration  exist  within  on-site  contracts  but  are  considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site. Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the  merchant  business  are  usually  three  to  seven  year  supply  agreements  based  on  the  requirements  of  the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable components of consideration within merchant contracts are constrained however this consideration is not significant.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then  filled  for  distribution  to  customers.  Cylinders  may  be  delivered  to  the  customer's  site  or  picked  up  by  the  customer  at  a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe  company's  performance  obligations  related  to  packaged  gases  are  satisfied  at  a  point  in  time.  Accordingly,  revenue  is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store,  and  the  company  has  the  right  to  payment  from  the  customer  in  accordance  with  the  contract  terms.  Any  variable consideration is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved.\n\n## Linde Engineering\n\nThe  company  designs  and  manufactures  equipment  for  air  separation  and  other  industrial  gas  applications  manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily  using  a  cost  incurred  input  method.  Costs  incurred  to  date  relative  to  total  estimated  costs  at  completion  are  used  to measure  progress  toward  satisfying  performance  obligations.  Costs  incurred  include  material,  labor,  and  overhead  costs  and represent  work  contributing  and  proportionate  to  the  transfer  of  control  to  the  customer.  Contract  modifications  are  typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change.\n\n## Contract Assets and Liabilities\n\nContract  assets  and  liabilities  result  from  differences  in  timing  of  revenue  recognition  and  customer  invoicing.  Contract  assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities  include  advance  payments  or  right  to  consideration  prior  to  performance  under  the  contract.  Contract  liabilities  are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of $134 million at December 31, 2021 and $162 million at December 31, 2020. Total contract liabilities are $3,699 million at December 31, 2021 (current of $2,940 million and $759 million within other long-",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product (typically oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen) and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied  by  cryogenic  and  process  gas  on-site  plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to customers by pipeline. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and containing minimum  purchase  requirements  and  price  escalation  provisions.  Many  of  the  cryogenic  on-site  plants  also  produce  liquid  products  for  the  merchant  market. Therefore,  plants  are  typically  not  dedicated  to  a  single  customer.  Air  separation  technologies  also  allow  on-site  delivery  to  customers  with  smaller  volume requirements.\n\nMerchant. The merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, helium and carbon dioxide. The deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site which are usually owned and maintained by Linde and leased to the customer. Due to distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to sevenyear requirement contracts.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Packaged gases include atmospheric gases, hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, acetylene and related products. Linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and through purchase orders.\n\n## Engineering\n\nLinde's Engineering business has a global presence, with its focus on market segments such as air separation, hydrogen, synthesis, olefin and natural gas plants. The company utilizes its extensive process engineering expertise in the planning, design and construction of highly efficient plants for the production and processing of gases. With its state-of-the-art sustainable technologies Engineering also helps customers avoid, capture and utilize carbon dioxide emissions. Its technology portfolio covers the entire value chain for production, liquefaction, storage, distribution and application of hydrogen which supports the transition to clean energy. Its digital services and solutions increase plant efficiency and performance.\n\nLinde's plants are used in a wide variety of fields: in the petrochemical and chemical industries, in refineries and fertilizer plants, to recover air gases, to produce synthesis gases, to treat natural gas and to produce noble gases. The Engineering business either supplies plant components directly to the customer or to the industrial gas business of Linde which operates the plants under a long-term gases supply contract.\n\nInventories - Linde carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases and hardgoods to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. On-site plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory. Inventory obsolescence is not material to Linde's business.\n\nCustomers - Linde is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers.\n\nInternational - Linde is a global enterprise with approximately 65% of its 2024 sales outside of the United States. The company also has majority or wholly owned subsidiaries that operate in approximately 45 European, Middle Eastern and African countries (including G ermany, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Sweden, and the  Republic  of  South Africa);  approx imately  20 Asian  and  South  Pacific  countries  (including  China, Australia,  India  and  South  Korea);  and  approx imately  20 countries in North and South America (including U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil).\n\nThe company also has equity method investments operating in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nLinde's non-U.S. business is subject to risks customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, import and export  controls,  and  other  economic,  political  and  regulatory  policies  of  local  governments. Also,  see  Item  1A.  'Risk  Factors'  and  Item  7A.  'Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.'\n\nSeasonality Linde's business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant ex tent.\n\nResearch and Development - Linde's research and development is directed toward development of gas processing, separation and liquefaction technologies, and clean energy technologies; improving distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases. This results in the development of new advanced air separation, hydrogen, synthesis gas, natural gas, adsorption and chemical process technologies; novel clean energy and carbon management solutions; as well as the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde maintained a consistent three-tiered distribution model (on-site, merchant, and packaged gases) for atmospheric gases, but showed subtle evolution in how it described contract structures and customer alignment. In 2022, on-site contracts were described as typically 10\u201320 years with minimum purchase requirements, and Linde operated plants not dedicated to single customers. By 2023, the company emphasized that on-site contracts included price escalation provisions and variable pricing tied to indices, with performance obligations satisfied over time. In 2024, Linde introduced more detailed segmentation, noting that on-site contracts increasingly served smaller-volume customers due to advances in air separation technology, while merchant contracts were typically 3\u20137 years without minimum purchase requirements. This reflects a strategic evolution toward flexibility and broader market reach, especially for smaller-volume clients, while maintaining long-term contractual stability in on-site delivery.",

The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde listed rare gases (such as krypton, neon, and xenon) as part of its broader industrial gases portfolio, produced primarily through cryogenic air separation and supplied using the company\u2019s three distribution methods. The 2023 filing reiterated this positioning, emphasizing rare gases as a core atmospheric gas offering alongside oxygen, nitrogen, and argon. By 2024, Linde explicitly identified itself as a market leader in non-cryogenic air separation technologies, a significant evolution that enhances its ability to produce rare gases more efficiently. This progression shows Linde's strategic shift toward technological differentiation, particularly through innovations like vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) and membrane separation, which likely strengthen its competitive advantage by improving production efficiency and customer service capabilities in high-demand industrial applications.",

REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, energy, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage;  (ii)  merchant  or  bulk  liquid;  and  (iii)  packaged  or  cylinder  gases.  The  distribution  method  used  by  Linde  to  supply  a customer  is  determined  by  many  factors,  including  the  customer's  volume  requirements  and  location.  The  distribution  method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its  industrial  gases  business  are  atmospheric  gases  (oxygen,  nitrogen,  argon,  rare  gases)  and  process  gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1.     BUSINE SS\n\n## General\n\nLinde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland with its principal offices in the United Kingdom and United States. Linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene, etc.). The company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\nLinde's sales were $33,005 million, $32,854 million, and $33,364 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde's reportable segments.\n\n## Industrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes\n\nAtmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using ambient air as feedstock, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Linde is the market leader in the field of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. As part of this process Linde also produces rare gases, such as krypton, neon, and xenon. As a pioneer and leader in industrial gases, Linde is continuously developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and technologies to produce, store, distribute and increase usage of its gases. These technologies open important new markets and provide customers with opportunities to reduce costs, by increasing their operational efficiencies, including vacuum pressure swing adsorption ('VPSA') and membrane separation technology to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen on-site.\n\nProcess gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by other production methods.\n\nHydrogen is produced from a range of different feedstocks using a wide portfolio of technologies. Today, carbon intensity is used to designate and differentiate between the production processes and the respective feedstocks used to produce the molecule. The majority of conventional hydrogen currently produced by Linde is derived from natural gas or methane, using steam methane reformation (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) technology. Linde has a range of technologies to produce low-carbon hydrogen from fossil feedstocks, or renewable hydrogen from renewable energy (non-fossil feedstock). Both products are considered sources of clean energy. Low-carbon (blue) hydrogen is produced primarily from methane, by capturing carbon emissions from a hydrogen production plant and sequestering them subsurface for the long term. Renewable (green) hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy and water as feedstock. Other sources of lowcarbon hydrogen are existing chemical and petrochemical processes, out of which Linde recovers hydrogen for subsequent treatment and cleaning to achieve ultrahigh purity levels.\n\nCarbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of natural gas or other feedstock such as naphtha, a by-product  in  the  petrochemical  industry.  Most  carbon  diox ide  comes  as  an  industrial  by-product,  that  is  sourced  from  chemical  plants,  refineries  and  other processes or is recovered from natural carbon dioxide sources. Raw carbon dioxide is processed and purified in Linde's plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Helium is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water.\n\n## Industrial Gases Distribution\n\nThere are three basic distribution  methods  for  industrial  gases:  (i)  on-site  or  tonnage;  (ii)  merchant  or  bulk  liquid;  and  (iii)  packaged  or  cylinder  gases.  These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer's needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).\n\n## Linde plc and Subsidiaries\n\n## PART I",

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde identified cultural challenges as a key risk in integrating acquisitions, specifically noting difficulties in aligning employees from acquired companies into its existing organization. By 2023, the company reiterated these concerns and expanded on the complexity of integrating operations across different cultures and languages, particularly in foreign acquisitions. In 2024, Linde again highlighted cultural integration as a persistent risk, emphasizing that despite historical success, the challenges remained a central concern in achieving targeted synergies and cost reductions. This 3-year trend suggests that while Linde continues to pursue an active M&A strategy, cultural integration remains a consistent and unresolved operational hurdle that could impact long-term synergies and strategic execution.",

Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities  related  to  Linde's  plans.  Linde  utilizes  the  services  of  independent  actuaries,  whose  models  are  used  to  facilitate  these  calculations.  Several  key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets, discount rates, or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions.\n\n## Operational risks may adversely impact Linde's business or results of operations.\n\nLinde's operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer contract requirements and other needs. Insufficient or ex cess capacity threatens Linde's ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose Linde to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are also dependent on Linde's ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget and in accordance with performance requirements. Failure to do so may expose Linde's business to loss of revenue, potential litigation and loss of business reputation.\n\nAlso inherent in the management of Linde's production facilities and delivery systems, including storage, vehicle transportation and pipelines, are operational risks that  require  continuous  training,  oversight  and  control.  Material  operating  failures  at  production,  storage  facilities  or  pipelines,  including  fire,  tox ic  release  and explosions, or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, loss of production and/or extensive property damage, all of which may negatively impact Linde's financial results.\n\n## Linde may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\n\nLinde  relies  on  information  technology  systems  and  networks  for  business  and  operational  activities,  and  also  stores  and  processes  sensitive  business  and proprietary information in these systems and networks. These systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of security.\n\nLinde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery processes. Despite these steps, however, our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future will likely be subject to increasingly sophisticated  cyber  attacks. Operational failures and breaches of security from such attempts could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to Linde or our employees and customers or suppliers. These failures and breaches could result in business interruption or malfunction and lead to legal or regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on Linde's operations, reputation and financial results.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde's distribution strategy for atmospheric gases maintained consistent segmentation into on-site, merchant, and packaged gases, but evolved in terms of contract specificity and delivery scope. In 2022, Linde emphasized the volume and location-based determination of distribution methods and outlined contract terms tied to customer requirements. By 2023, the company provided more granular detail on contract durations\u2014such as 10\u201320-year terms for on-site contracts with minimum purchase requirements and price escalations, and 3\u20137-year agreements for merchant contracts without volume commitments. In 2024, Linde further refined its revenue recognition policies, emphasizing point-in-time recognition for merchant and packaged gas deliveries and introducing more clarity around performance obligations, especially for packaged gas where pickup options were explicitly mentioned. The 2024 report also introduced a new section on equipment manufacturing for air separation, indicating a strategic expansion into complementary product offerings for industrial gas applications.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, energy, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage;  (ii)  merchant  or  bulk  liquid;  and  (iii)  packaged  or  cylinder  gases.

By 2023, the company maintained this production structure but began to highlight the integration of rare gases into broader industrial applications, such as electronics and healthcare, signaling an emerging focus on downstream market alignment. In 2024, Linde explicitly positioned itself as a market leader in non-cryogenic air separation technologies, a key innovation driver for rare gas production (e.g., krypton, neon, xenon), and emphasized proprietary technologies that enable cost reductions and efficiency improvements for customers. This 3-year evolution shows a strategic pivot toward leveraging rare gases as a competitive differentiator in high-growth sectors like electronics and clean energy, supported by technological leadership and expanded market applications.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1.     BUSINE SS\n\n## General\n\nLinde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland with its principal offices in the United Kingdom and United States. Linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene, etc.). The company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\nLinde's sales were $33,005 million, $32,854 million, and $33,364 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde's reportable segments.\n\n## Industrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes\n\nAtmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using ambient air as feedstock, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Linde is the market leader in the field of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. As part of this process Linde also produces rare gases, such as krypton, neon, and xenon. As a pioneer and leader in industrial gases, Linde is continuously developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and technologies to produce, store, distribute and increase usage of its gases. These technologies open important new markets and provide customers with opportunities to reduce costs, by increasing their operational efficiencies, including vacuum pressure swing adsorption ('VPSA') and membrane separation technology to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen on-site.\n\nProcess gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by other production methods.\n\nHydrogen is produced from a range of different feedstocks using a wide portfolio of technologies. Today, carbon intensity is used to designate and differentiate between the production processes and the respective feedstocks used to produce the molecule. The majority of conventional hydrogen currently produced by Linde is derived from natural gas or methane, using steam methane reformation (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) technology. Linde has a range of technologies to produce low-carbon hydrogen from fossil feedstocks, or renewable hydrogen from renewable energy (non-fossil feedstock). Both products are considered sources of clean energy. Low-carbon (blue) hydrogen is produced primarily from methane, by capturing carbon emissions from a hydrogen production plant and sequestering them subsurface for the long term. Renewable (green) hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy and water as feedstock. Other sources of lowcarbon hydrogen are existing chemical and petrochemical processes, out of which Linde recovers hydrogen for subsequent treatment and cleaning to achieve ultrahigh purity levels.\n\nCarbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of natural gas or other feedstock such as naphtha, a by-product  in  the  petrochemical  industry.  Most  carbon  diox ide  comes  as  an  industrial  by-product,  that  is  sourced  from  chemical  plants,  refineries  and  other processes or is recovered from natural carbon dioxide sources. Raw carbon dioxide is processed and purified in Linde's plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Helium is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water.\n\n## Industrial Gases Distribution\n\nThere are three basic distribution  methods  for  industrial  gases:  (i)  on-site  or  tonnage;  (ii)  merchant  or  bulk  liquid;  and  (iii)  packaged  or  cylinder  gases.  These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer's needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).\n\n## Linde plc and Subsidiaries\n\n## PART I",

Intersegment sales, primarily from Engineering to the industrial gases segments, were not material.\n\n(b) Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment - net.\n\n## 19. REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, energy, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage;  (ii)  merchant  or  bulk  liquid;  and  (iii)  packaged  or  cylinder  gases.  The  distribution  method  used  by  Linde  to  supply  a customer  is  determined  by  many  factors,  including  the  customer's  volume  requirements  and  location.  The  distribution  method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its  industrial  gases  business  are  atmospheric  gases  (oxygen,  nitrogen,  argon,  rare  gases)  and  process  gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers' sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline",

Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities  related  to  Linde's  plans.  Linde  utilizes  the  services  of  independent  actuaries,  whose  models  are  used  to  facilitate  these  calculations.  Several  key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets, discount rates, or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions.\n\n## Operational risks may adversely impact Linde's business or results of operations.\n\nLinde's operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer contract requirements and other needs. Insufficient or ex cess capacity threatens Linde's ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose Linde to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are also dependent on Linde's ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget and in accordance with performance requirements. Failure to do so may expose Linde's business to loss of revenue, potential litigation and loss of business reputation.\n\nAlso inherent in the management of Linde's production facilities and delivery systems, including storage, vehicle transportation and pipelines, are operational risks that  require  continuous  training,  oversight  and  control.  Material  operating  failures  at  production,  storage  facilities  or  pipelines,  including  fire,  tox ic  release  and explosions, or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, loss of production and/or extensive property damage, all of which may negatively impact Linde's financial results.\n\n## Linde may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\n\nLinde  relies  on  information  technology  systems  and  networks  for  business  and  operational  activities,  and  also  stores  and  processes  sensitive  business  and proprietary information in these systems and networks. These systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of security.\n\nLinde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery processes. Despite these steps, however, our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future will likely be subject to increasingly sophisticated  cyber  attacks. Operational failures and breaches of security from such attempts could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to Linde or our employees and customers or suppliers. These failures and breaches could result in business interruption or malfunction and lead to legal or regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on Linde's operations, reputation and financial results. To date, such attempts have not had any significant impact on Linde's operations or financial results.\n\n## The inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact Linde's financial position and results of operations.\n\nLinde  has  evaluated  and  expects  to  continue  to  evaluate,  a  wide  array  of  potential  strategic  acquisitions  and  joint  ventures.  Many  of  these  transactions,  if consummated, could be material to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company, business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Although historically Linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution, the areas where Linde may face risks include:\n\n- the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n- diversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenges;\n- cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the existing organization;\n- the need to integrate each company's accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management;\n- difficulty with the assimilation of acquired operations and products;\n- failure to achieve targeted synergies and cost reductions; and",

Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairments of goodwill, any of which could adversely impact Linde's financial results.\n\n## Linde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with, these laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company's business, financial position and results of operations.\n\nLinde is subject to regulations in the following areas, among others:\n\n- environmental protection, including climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies;\n- U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and currency controls;\n- safety;\n- securities laws applicable in the United States, the European Union, Germany, Ireland, and other jurisdictions;\n- trade and import/export restrictions, as well as economic sanctions laws;\n- antitrust matters;\n- data protection;\n- global anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n- healthcare regulations.\n\nChanges in these or other regulatory areas may impact Linde's profitability and may give rise to new or increased compliance risks: it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance, and the level of sanctions in the event of non-compliance may rise. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or sanctions, cancellation of marketing rights or restrictions on participation in, or even exclusion from, public tender proceedings, all of which could have a material adverse impact on Linde's financial results and/or reputation.",
