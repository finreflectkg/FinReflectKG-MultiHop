      "question": "How did Microsoft's acquisition of Nuance in 2022 influence the strategic alignment of its cloud services with AI-driven enterprise solutions by 2024, particularly in terms of realized synergies and integration costs reflected in the Intelligent Cloud segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft completed the acquisition of Nuance, which was integrated into Azure and other cloud services revenue, contributing to both cloud services and Server products performance. By 2024, the integration had progressed to the point where goodwill from the acquisition\u2014specifically tied to expected synergies\u2014was assigned to the Intelligent Cloud segment. This indicates a strategic deepening of Nuance\u2019s AI and speech recognition capabilities within Microsoft\u2019s cloud infrastructure. Additionally, the $986 million in convertible senior notes issued by Nuance (substantially redeemed by 2024) reflects the financial evolution of the acquisition's capital structure as part of the integration process.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm identified Samsung as a major customer that had the potential to vertically integrate by developing its own integrated circuit products instead of using Qualcomm's. By 2023, this risk materialized as Samsung was explicitly listed as a competitor, reflecting a shift in the relationship from customer to competitor due to Samsung's increased development and use of internally designed integrated circuits. This evolution likely reduced Qualcomm's revenue opportunities with Samsung while increasing competitive pressure in the semiconductor market, particularly in mobile handsets and IoT. The change aligns with broader industry trends where major OEMs are increasingly developing in-house components, impacting Qualcomm\u2019s market position and pricing power.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world.

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft disclosed that Nuance had issued $986 million in convertible senior notes in 2015 and 2017, with $985 million redeemed prior to June 30, 2022, leaving $1 million outstanding. By 2023, Microsoft noted that 'substantially all' of those notes had been redeemed, indicating near-complete resolution of this debt instrument. This evolution reflects Microsoft's strategic integration of Nuance, as highlighted by the continued attribution of goodwill to synergies from the acquisition. The shift from partial redemption in 2022 to near-full redemption in 2023 demonstrates both financial and strategic alignment in the post-acquisition phase.",

By 2024, this strategic emphasis had increased IBM's exposure to evolving AI regulations, as noted in its 10-K filing, which highlighted the growing complexity and uncertainty in the global regulatory environment for AI. The company faced heightened compliance costs and operational risks due to the need for greater transparency, bias mitigation, and intellectual property safeguards in AI models. Additionally, IBM's global presence\u2014operating in over 175 countries\u2014amplified its regulatory exposure, particularly in areas such as data privacy, AI-specific laws, and cloud regulations. These factors required IBM to adapt its internal controls, risk management frameworks, and compliance strategies to align with both U.S. and international standards, reflecting a clear temporal evolution from proactive AI adoption to regulatory-driven adaptation.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies.

The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDue to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, ex port and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company's ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.\n\nThe Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flex ibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.\n\nIneffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nThe Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' In addition, as discussed in note Q, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.\n\nThe Company's Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and ex perienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the",

      "answer": "In 2022, CSCO had $0.6 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding and maintained a $10.0 billion short-term financing program, while also using interest rate swaps on $1.5 billion of senior fixed-rate notes to hedge against interest rate fluctuations. By 2024, CSCO significantly increased its long-term debt issuance, raising $13.5 billion in senior notes, which rank at par with commercial paper notes.

We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times.

      "answer": "CSCO's allowance for credit losses on loan receivables dropped from $103 million in 2023 to $53 million in 2024, indicating a significant decrease in expected credit risk. Since loan receivables are directly tied to financing arrangements for technical support and advanced services, this reduction suggests either improved credit quality of customers receiving financed services or a strategic tightening of financing eligibility. The drop in allowance aligns with a broader context where financing receivables decreased by 2% in 2024 compared to 2023, implying a more conservative approach to customer financing.

Financing receivables decreased by 2% as compared with the end of fiscal 2023.\n\nFinancing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.\n\nThe volume of channel partner financing was $27.1 billion, $32.1 billion, and $27.9 billion in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 27, 2024,",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft disclosed that $986 million of convertible senior notes were issued by Nuance, with $985 million redeemed prior to June 30, leaving $1 million outstanding and included in other current liabilities. By 2024, Microsoft's filing indicates that 'substantially all' of the $986 million in convertible senior notes had been redeemed, suggesting the remaining $1 million was likely redeemed in the interim. This evolution in the redemption status reflects a strategic move to reduce post-acquisition financial liabilities tied to Nuance, aligning with a broader financial consolidation strategy following the integration of Nuance into Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Samsung was a major customer of QCOM's integrated circuit products, contributing to the semiconductor segment's revenue and highlighting the company's reliance on a few large OEMs. However, by 2024, Samsung had developed its own integrated circuit products, transitioning from a customer to a direct competitor. This shift intensified QCOM's exposure to customer concentration risk, especially as Samsung began using its own chips in some or all of its devices and potentially selling them to third parties. In response, QCOM emphasized diversification into non-handset sectors like automotive and IoT, though these markets themselves posed risks of new forms of concentration.

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices.

Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Mobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors' integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless networks, which may enable such competitors to better optimize their integrated circuit products for performance on those networks; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions.\n\nIn addition, certain of our largest customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers, such as Apple and Samsung, have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize or may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers; limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us; or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows, and/or enabling critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development, and commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nCompetition in any or all product areas or device tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees' products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n\n## Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are ex acerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices, including motor vehicles or motor vehicle systems. We routinely monitor for and assess security vulnerabilities in our products and offer remediation measures if appropriate. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or provide remediation measures for vulnerabilities (or our customers may fail to implement remediation measures) before they are exploited.\n\nOur products may be used in devices that interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content, which creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers' products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers' products or IT infrastructure.

      "question": "How did AMD's competitive positioning against Intel in the discrete GPU market evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in light of Intel's aggressive product strategies and AMD's segment reporting changes?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD reported that Intel's aggressive business practices, including product bundling, pricing strategies, and the release of its own high-end discrete GPUs, negatively impacted AMD's competitive position, particularly in the GPU market. Intel's dominance in the broader microprocessor market and its ability to influence OEMs and set de facto standards created challenges for AMD's unit sales and average selling prices. By 2024, AMD responded by formally establishing its Gaming segment, which now explicitly includes discrete GPUs as a core product line. This structural change indicates a strategic realignment to prioritize GPU development and commercialization, likely in direct response to Intel's intensified competition. The elevation of discrete GPUs to a dedicated segment suggests that AMD increased investment and focus in this area to counter Intel's market influence and improve its competitive positioning.",

      "question": "How did the dependency on sole suppliers for APU product components in 2022 impact AMD's risk exposure with AIB partners in 2023, particularly in light of supply chain volatility and potential inventory protection liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD's APU products were heavily dependent on a limited number of suppliers, including sole-source providers for critical components like substrates and memory, which exposed the company to supply shortages and cost volatility. This dependency directly affected AIB partners in 2023, who rely on stable product availability and inventory protection to manage their own risks. The 2023 filing highlights that AMD's AIB partners maintain inventory of AMD products with price protection rights, which could materially impact AMD if significant price reductions occurred due to supply imbalances. Therefore, the supply chain constraints in 2022 likely increased the risk exposure for both AMD and its AIB partners in 2023, especially in terms of inventory liabilities and supply allocation challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "## If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number  of  suppliers  and  our  operations  depend  upon  obtaining  deliveries  of  adequate  supplies  of  equipment  and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU  products.  Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.",

      "question": "How did the increased client contract termination flexibility in 2023 impact ACN's revenue recognition policies, given the operational risks related to client dependency highlighted in 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ACN highlighted significant operational risks tied to client dependency, noting that disruptions in communication, travel, and global delivery capabilities could materially affect their ability to serve clients, especially given their concentration of delivery centers in India and the Philippines. By 2023, ACN disclosed that the majority of their contracts were terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, which directly affects how revenue is recognized. This increased contract termination flexibility means that only the non-cancelable portion of contracts is included in remaining performance obligations, reducing revenue predictability. As a result, ACN had to refine its revenue recognition policies to rely more heavily on cost-incurred-to-date estimates for technology integration consulting services, increasing the volatility of reported revenues and requiring more frequent reassessment of contract cost estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified people, these types of events impact our ability to deliver our services and solutions to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network or cloud services at our facilities or in the areas where our people are working remotely, as well as physical infrastructure damage to, system failures at, cyberattacks on, or security incidents involving, our facilities or systems, or those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers or clients, could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and people, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace. Moreover, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that are difficult to accurately predict, including: the emergence and virulence of new variants; the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 globally; government, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the effect on the macroeconomic environment and on our clients and their supply chains.\n\nOur business model is dependent on our global delivery capability. While our delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery capability in India and the Philippines, where we have the largest and second largest number of our people located, respectively. In addition, certain of our clients and markets are primarily supported by individual delivery centers. Concentrating our delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks, including those discussed in this risk factor, many of which are beyond our control and which have been and may in the future be exacerbated by increasing geopolitical tensions. While these events have not materially impacted our ability to deliver services to our clients, international conflicts are unpredictable and we might not be as successful in mitigating these operational risks in the future.\n\nWe are unable to protect our people, facilities and systems, and those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers and clients, against all such events. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur where large numbers of our people are located, or simultaneously affect our people in multiple locations around the world. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.\n\n## If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.\n\nAs of August 31, 2022, we had more than 721,000 employees worldwide. Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. As our organization grows and evolves, it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge or to effectively change the strategy, operations or culture of our Company in a timely manner. It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our people and operations, effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, and motivate, engage and retain our people, particularly given our world-wide operations, rate of new hires, and the significant percentage of our employees who have the option to work remotely. The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of sensitive or confidential information entrusted to us, or obtained inappropriately, or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data and proprietary information. Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.\n\n## We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.\n\nWe expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. We have increased and may again in the future increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities. These acquisitions and other transactions and investments involve challenges and risks, such as that we may not succeed in completing targeted transactions, including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive, or achieve desired results of operations.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft disclosed that it had assumed $986 million in Nuance convertible senior notes issued in 2015 and 2017, most of which had already been redeemed. By 2024, the continued mention of these notes in the context of Nuance integration suggests that while the financial obligations were largely resolved, the strategic integration of Nuance into the Intelligent Cloud segment was still underway. The persistence of Nuance-related disclosures in Microsoft's filings indicates a sustained focus on realizing synergies, despite the redemption of most notes. This shows that while the financial integration progressed, the operational and strategic integration remained a key focus area.",

      "question": "How did the delays in finalizing new license agreements with OEMs in 2024, driven by strategies to reduce royalty payments, impact Qualcomm's revenue recognition patterns compared to 2023 disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Qualcomm disclosed that changes in patent licensing practices\u2014such as reduced royalty rates or multi-level licensing structures\u2014could negatively impact revenues, with potential delays in revenue recognition until negotiations were completed. By 2024, evidence showed that some licensees were delaying agreements or disputing terms, leading to binding arbitration clauses being triggered in certain cases. This caused Qualcomm to rely more heavily on estimates for royalty recognition, with adjustments made in subsequent periods as actual data became available. In particular, the 2024 financial disclosures revealed that Qualcomm recognized immaterial differences between preliminary estimates and actual royalties paid, but still faced challenges in recognizing revenue in a timely manner due to licensee behavior. This reflects a shift from a theoretical risk in 2023 to a recurring operational challenge in 2024, where revenue recognition became more contingent on post-period reconciliations rather than upfront agreement.",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nLicense agreements contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that ex ists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated.\n\nLicensees pay per-unit royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and, to a lesser ex tent, lump sum payments (license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). License fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licenseeby-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is ex ecuted and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement. If all such conditions are not met, revenues and any associated receivables are generally not recognized until such time that the required conditions are met. Cash collected from customers prior to a contract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting, underpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items, evaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees' conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other items, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are newly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues have been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and enforceable right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\n\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\n\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable, net (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Microsoft included System Center as part of its Server products and cloud services under the Intelligent Cloud segment. By fiscal year 2024, this integration remained intact, with System Center continuing to be a core component of the Server products and cloud services portfolio. During this period, the revenue from Server products and cloud services grew significantly, increasing from $67.35 billion in 2022 to $97.726 billion in 2024, representing a $30.376 billion increase. This growth suggests that Microsoft's continued emphasis on integrated infrastructure solutions, including System Center, played a key role in expanding its cloud and server offerings.",

By fiscal year 2024, Notice 2023-55 delayed the effective date of these regulations to fiscal year 2024, and Notice 2023-80 further delayed them indefinitely. This delay contributed to a decrease in Microsoft's effective tax rate from 19% in 2023 to 18% in 2024.

Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first  five  years,  15%  in  year  six,  20%  in  year  seven,  and  25%  in  year  eight.  We  have  paid  transition  tax  of  $6.2  billion,  which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2022. The remaining transition tax of $12.0 billion is payable over the next four years, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nProvisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on July 1, 2022. These provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them on the U.S. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on where research is conducted. The final foreign tax credit regulations, also effective on July 1, 2022, introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit calculations in the U.S. tax return. While these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate on a net basis, our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nDuring fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 95 million shares and 101 million shares of our common stock for $28.0 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2022, $40.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.62 per share. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## PART II\n\nItem 7",

The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD's product design was heavily dependent on third-party intellectual property, particularly for development and testing tools. This reliance posed a risk if IP became unavailable or did not meet the required performance or manufacturing technology needs, especially for their 7nm product portfolio fabricated at TSMC. By 2024, the risk evolved further, with AMD noting that unavailability or delayed access to third-party IP could not only hinder design but also affect their ability to meet customer demand for more advanced features and functionality. The 2024 filing emphasized that if third-party IP was not available at the needed time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point, it could materially adversely affect their business. This shows a continuity in the risk but with increased emphasis on the timing and technological alignment of IP availability with AMD\u2019s product roadmap.",

Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software prov iders designing and dev eloping software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to dev elop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software prov iders may forego designing their software applications to take adv antage of our innov ations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products.

      "question": "How did AMD's introduction of FPGAs in 2023 relate to the evolving export control restrictions under EAR in 2024, particularly regarding shipments to China and D5 countries?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD introduced FPGAs as part of its data center and embedded computing product portfolio, emphasizing their role in high-performance and adaptive computing. However, in October 2023, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issued new export controls under the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), which governs the export of certain AMD products, including FPGAs. These controls restricted AMD from shipping certain Versal\u2122 FPGAs to China or customers with ultimate parents in D5 countries without a license. By 2024, these EAR-imposed restrictions had evolved to include additional notification and licensing requirements, such as the Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) process, which required AMD to notify BIS 25 days before shipping certain FPGAs to these regions. This regulatory evolution directly impacted AMD's ability to market and deliver its newly introduced FPGA products in 2023 to key international markets in 2024, increasing compliance complexity and potentially reducing sales opportunities.",

        "Hop 2: FPGAs \u2192 EAR: The Export Administration Regulation (EAR) governs the export and re-export of AMD's FPGAs, especially to D5 countries like China, as noted in the October 2023 BIS controls.",
        "Hop 3: EAR \u2190 AMD(2024): In 2024, AMD remained subject to EAR regulations, with expanded NAC notification requirements and potential shipment prohibitions affecting FPGA exports to China and D5-linked customers."

These controls prev ent us from shipping certain AMD Instinct\u2122 integrated circuits and certain AMD Versal\u2122 FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China), without a license. These controls also require us to file a  Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification with BIS 25 days before shipping certain Versal FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China). The NAC notification process could result in BIS prohibiting a shipment or requiring  a  license  application  before  shipping  a  product  that  is  the  subject  of  a  NAC  notification.  BIS  may  issue  new  licensing  requirements  and regulatory controls in the future. Ev en new products that fall below the licensing thresholds may not be successful because we hav e no assurances BIS will agree that the alternativ e products are not subject to the new licensing requirements or that future regulations will not control the alternativ e products. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result  in  lost  sales  adv ersely  impacting  our  reputation  and  business.  T here  is  also  a  possibility  of  future  tariffs,  trade  protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our current and future products, customers, or suppliers by the United States, China or other countries that could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business. New export control restrictions may adv ersely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all. In addition, deemed export restrictions could further affect our ability to prov ide serv ices or dev elop products in the United States.\n\nUnited States export control regulations include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain AI technologies to United States embargoed or sanctioned countries, gov ernments, persons and entities. If there are changes to those regulations, or to the categorization of our products under those regulations, our ability to sell our products and serv ices outside the United States may be harmed. The United States and its allies continue to focus on export restrictions targeting semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products and serv ices. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and in the future is likely to further adopt other unilateral or multilateral controls. The scope and application of such controls hav e been and may again be v ery broad, which may prohibit us from exporting or prov iding access to our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negativ ely impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to meet demand abroad. If these export controls targeting semiconductors associated with AI including GPUs and associated products and serv ices are further tightened, our ability to export our technology, products or serv ices could be further restricted. We may be at a competitiv e disadv antage if our competitors are not subject to the same or similar restrictions. Additionally, such export controls hav e, and may in the future, subject downstream recipients of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair or transfer of our products and may hav e a material adv erse effect on us.\n\nWe may, from time to time, receiv e technical data from third parties that is subject to the International T raffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State.  Export Administration  Regulation  (EAR)  gov erns  the  export  and  re-export  of  certain AMD  products, including FPGAs, as well as the transfer of related technologies or prov ision of serv ices, whether in the U.S. or abroad. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when or pursuant to which conditions they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. When we file license applications or Notification Adv anced Computing (NAC) exception notices we hav e no assurance that BIS will grant any exemptions or licenses or that the BIS will act on the filings in a timely manner. Ev en if BIS grants a requested license, the license may come with burdensome conditions that we cannot or decide not to fulfill. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export priv ileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractiv e to ov erseas customers, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\n\n## If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positiv e and negativ e ev idence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may hav e a material adv erse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's introduction of the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 in 2023 relate to its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. in late 2023 and the subsequent exclusion of Activision Blizzard from Microsoft's 2024 internal control over financial reporting assessment?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft introduced the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 through a supplemental indenture, indicating its financial structuring activities. These notes were originally issued by Activision Blizzard, Inc., which Microsoft acquired on October 13, 2023. By 2024, Microsoft's 10-K filing excluded Activision Blizzard from its internal control over financial reporting assessment, citing that Activision Blizzard's financial statements represented less than 1% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles) and 2% of total revenues. This suggests that while Microsoft had integrated Activision Blizzard financially (as seen through the assumption of its debt instruments), it had not yet fully incorporated Activision Blizzard\u2019s internal controls into its broader compliance framework by June 30, 2024.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total rev enues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiv eness of internal control ov er financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control ov er financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control ov er financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and ev aluating the design and operating effectiv eness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believ e that our audit prov ides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control ov er financial reporting is a process designed to prov ide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control ov er financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) prov ide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) prov ide reasonable assurance regarding prev ention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could hav e a material effect on the financial statements.",

      "answer": "The indefinite delay of the Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations through Notice 2023-80 in 2024 provided Microsoft with continued flexibility in managing its foreign tax credits, contributing to a lower effective tax rate of 18% in 2024 compared to 19% in 2023. This regulatory relief allowed Microsoft to maintain a higher proportion of pre-tax income in foreign jurisdictions, particularly Ireland, where its regional operating center generated 83% of foreign pre-tax income in 2024 versus 81% in 2023. The combination of favorable tax treatment and delayed compliance requirements enabled Microsoft to optimize its global tax position, resulting in a $10.0 billion increase in foreign pre-tax income (from $36.4 billion in 2023 to $44.9 billion in 2024), while U.S. pre-tax income rose by $10.0 billion (from $52.9 billion to $62.9 billion).",

        "Hop 2: Notice 2023-80 \u2192 Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations: The Notice delayed the implementation of these regulations, providing Microsoft with additional time to adjust its international tax strategy.",
        "Hop 3: Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations \u2190 MSFT(2024): By 2024, Microsoft continued to benefit from the delayed implementation, enabling it to align its foreign income structure with the evolving regulatory environment."

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 83% and 81% of our foreign income before tax.

      "question": "How did Microsoft's treatment of Software Assurance (SA) within Open Value agreements evolve from FY2022 to FY2023, and what does this suggest about their revenue recognition strategy for small and medium organizations?",
      "answer": "In FY2022, Microsoft's Open Value agreements included SA as a standard component, allowing small and medium organizations to license cloud services and on-premises software over a three-year period with SA bundled in. By FY2023, the treatment of SA had evolved to require more judgment in determining standalone selling price (SSP) and recognizing revenue, particularly for on-premises licenses sold with SA. This included using a range of amounts to estimate SSP when products and services were sold separately, and applying stratification based on customer size and geography. Additionally, the timing of revenue recognition for SA-related licenses was influenced by the pattern of delivery and benefit exercise across the customer portfolio. This evolution suggests a shift toward a more nuanced and segmented revenue recognition strategy, tailored to customer characteristics, rather than a one-size-fits-all SA inclusion model.",

        "Hop 1: MSFT(2022) \u2192 Open Value: In FY2022, Open Value agreements included SA by default for small and medium organizations licensing software over a 3-year period.",

        "Hop 3: SA \u2190 MSFT(2023): In FY2023, SA required more nuanced revenue recognition judgments, including SSP estimation stratified by customer size and geography, and variable consideration modeling."

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft positioned Office as a comprehensive productivity suite competing directly with Slack, emphasizing integration, security, and flexibility. By 2024, Microsoft intensified its competitive stance against Slack by leveraging its Intelligent Cloud segment, particularly Azure AI, to enhance Office's capabilities with AI-driven tools and services. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from feature-based competition to an AI-powered ecosystem advantage, with Office now more deeply integrated into Microsoft\u2019s broader cloud infrastructure, including Azure and GitHub, to provide a more intelligent and scalable productivity platform.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "question": "How did Apple's 2022 supply chain risk disclosure regarding Taiwan evolve in relation to its 2024 geographic segmentation strategy, particularly in the context of Greater China's inclusion of Taiwan and Apple's ongoing operational exposure to geopolitical and public health risks?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Apple explicitly highlighted its supply chain dependency on Taiwan and the associated risks from geopolitical tensions and public health disruptions like the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company noted that a significant portion of its outsourced manufacturing was located in Asia, including Taiwan, and that trade restrictions or disruptions in these regions could materially impact its operations and margins. In 2024, Apple continued to include Taiwan as part of its Greater China geographic segment, indicating that despite known risks, its strategic operational footprint in the region remained unchanged. This continuity suggests that Apple's exposure to Taiwan-based supply chain risks persisted, even as the company maintained a dedicated geographic segment that encompasses the region, implying a strategic balance between risk and market opportunity in Greater China.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's reliance on Samsung in 2022 relate to its integrated circuit product strategy in 2024, particularly in light of Samsung's own development of competing integrated circuit products?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm identified Samsung as a major customer, contributing 10% or more of its consolidated revenues, indicating a significant reliance on Samsung for revenue stability. However, by 2024, Samsung was explicitly noted as a competitor in the integrated circuit product space, as it began developing and utilizing its own chips in certain devices rather than Qualcomm's products. This shift directly threatened Qualcomm\u2019s semiconductor business, as Samsung not only used its own chips internally but also had the potential to sell them to third parties, competing directly with Qualcomm. In response, Qualcomm increased its commitments to manufacturing capacity for its own integrated circuit products, with $12.8 billion in total inventory obligations as of September 2024, including $3.0 billion in advance payments for multi-year capacity purchase commitments. This evolution suggests that Qualcomm had to adapt its product and supply chain strategy to counteract Samsung\u2019s vertical integration, which originated as a customer relationship in 2022 but evolved into a competitive threat by 2024.",

QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including, but not limited to, 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business, our cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\n## Revenue Concentrations and Significant Customers\n\nA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2022, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies' and 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the use of 5G, the expansion into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in modem, radio-frequency integrated circuit, RFFE, multimedia (camera, video, display and computer vision), sensor perception and drive policy, advanced SoC, which includes specialized engines such as CPU and GPU to enable high performance and low-power computing and other optimization techniques, AI, packaging and a broad range of other technologies. We expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and technologies and to utilize that research and development in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of new modem and multimedia technologies and other technologies (such as ADAS/AD and XR), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world.\n\nWe continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhance existing products and services) for voice and data communications and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as ADAS/AD. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, voice and music devices, wearable devices and XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.\n\nWe develop innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.",

          "chunk_text": "products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases.

      "question": "How did Apple's reliance on third-party content providers in 2023 influence its content-related financial commitments in 2024, particularly in light of the $19.4 billion in unrecognized RSU compensation costs and the risks associated with short-term licensing arrangements?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Apple's business was heavily reliant on third-party content providers, as the availability of third-party software and digital content was critical to customer purchasing decisions and overall satisfaction. The company acknowledged risks stemming from short-term licensing arrangements and potential cost increases by content providers, which could limit Apple's ability to offer a wide variety of content on commercially reasonable terms. By 2024, this reliance translated into significant financial commitments, including $19.4 billion in unrecognized compensation costs tied to RSUs, which are often used to attract and retain the talent necessary to manage and develop content partnerships. Additionally, Apple's unconditional purchase obligations included substantial commitments to content licensing and distribution rights, reflecting the ongoing strategic importance and financial exposure tied to third-party content. The evolution from strategic dependence in 2023 to concrete financial exposure in 2024 highlights how Apple's content ecosystem is both a key asset and a growing liability.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If  third-party  software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relativ e benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and X box for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the A pp Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the A pp Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within  an  application.  From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS A pp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the A pp Store and Safari in the European Union ('EU') as it seeks to comply with the Digital M arkets A ct (the 'DM A '), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced A pp Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. \u00ae\n\n## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relativ ely  short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Qualcomm emphasized the integration of generative AI into mobile and edge devices as a key innovation driver across smartphones, PCs, and IoT (e.g., Snapdragon X Series platforms enabling on-device AI processing). This strategic focus on edge-based generative AI laid the foundation for their 2024 expansion into cloud computing, as evidenced by the formalization of their 'cloud computing processing initiative' as a nonreportable segment. The 2024 filing explicitly described how wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI by enabling intelligent data sharing with cloud-based applications. This reflects a deliberate evolution from edge AI enablement in 2023 to a more integrated cloud-edge strategy in 2024, where Qualcomm positions itself to support both on-device processing for immediacy and privacy, and cloud coordination for broader data access and model training.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "answer": "In 2023, AVGO identified product availability as a key risk factor, citing challenges related to compliance, supply chain disruptions, and sourcing constraints that could harm sales and operating results. By 2024, AVGO's dependency on TSMC became more pronounced, with TSMC manufacturing approximately 95% of the wafers produced by its contract manufacturers. This deepening reliance on a single supplier heightened the risk of supply constraints, particularly as TSMC also serves competitors and could prioritize their needs or reduce deliveries on short notice. The potential consequences evolved from general harm to sales and operations in 2023 to more specific financial risks in 2024, including the possibility of lost revenue opportunities, litigation, and adverse effects on gross margin. The chain reflects how AVGO's product availability risks became more tightly linked to TSMC's capacity and pricing decisions over time.",

If  we  experience  supply  constraints  from  our  third-party  manufacturing  suppliers,  we  may  be  required  to  allocate  the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our customers, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it  could  result  in  lost  sales  and  hav e  a  material  adv erse  effect  on  our  business.  For  example,  if  T SMC  is  not  able  to  manufacture  wafers  for  our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.\n\nWe do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain many of these manufacturing serv ices on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to prov ide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliv er those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or  eliminate  deliv eries  to  us,  which  could  hav e  a  material  adv erse  effect  on  our  business.  If  we  ov erestimate  our  customer  demand  or  experience  a decrease  in  customer  demand,  either  could  result  in  excess  inv entory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs.  We  are  party  to  a  wafer  supply agreement with GF where GF will prov ide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us and set pricing through 2026. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could hav e excess inv entory or higher inv entory unit costs, both of which may adv ersely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  ov er  deliv ery  schedules,  yield,  cycle  times,  quality assurance,  price  increases,  lack  of  capacity  in  periods  of  excess  demand,  misappropriation  of  our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  sev eral subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inv entory and parts. Moreov er, if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, water shortages, or high heat ev ents, lack sufficient capacity to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial  difficulties,  are  unable  to  secure  necessary  raw  materials  from  their  suppliers,  suffer  any  other disruption  or  reduction  in  efficiency,  or  experience  uncertain  env ironmental,  social,  atmospheric  or  natural,  economic  or  political  circumstances  or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, we experienced some inv entory loss due to an incident at a contract manufacturer. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of  our  products.  If  we  experience  problems  with  product  quality  or  are  unable  to  secure  sufficient  capacity  from  a  particular  third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely secure an alternativ e supply for any specific product. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternativ e third-party manufacturers, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectiv ely, the ATMP  JVs) with affiliates of  T ongfu  Microelectronics  Co.,  Ltd.  T he  majority  of  our ATMP serv ices are prov ided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements.

Our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques, and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our own or with a particular CM. Qualifying and establishing reliable production at acceptable yields with a new CM, if at all, is a lengthy and often expensive process.\n\nWe depend on our CMs to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. We do not generally have long-term capacity commitments with our CMs and substantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum quantities. Further, our CMs may fail to timely develop or successfully implement new, advanced manufacturing processes, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies. From time to time, our CMs may also cease to, or become unable to, manufacture a component for us.\n\nTSMC, one of our CMs, manufactured approximately 95% of the wafers manufactured by our CMs during fiscal year 2024. We believe our wafer requirements represent a meaningful portion of TSMC's total production capacity. However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including some of our competitors, and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. In addition, TSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to us.\n\nIf any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our customer demand, or to the same extent as our competitors, fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities. This could damage our relationships with our customers, result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations, or result in payment of significant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and gross margin.\n\n## We purchase a significant amount of the materials, including components, used in our products from a limited number of suppliers.\n\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. During fiscal year 2024, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials suppliers, some of which are single source suppliers. The lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials suppliers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices, any of which could disrupt supply or increase demand in the industry. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by i ncreased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China. Any such supply constraints could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## A prolonged disruption of our or our suppliers' manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the InP-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are concentrated in the same geographic regions of California and the Pacific Rim, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity, and i ncreases the risk of natural disasters impacting multiple suppliers. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located i n the Czech Republic, India, Israel, and the U.S., and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.\n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as climate change, water shortages, political unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, labor shortages, medical epidemics, economic instability, equipment failure or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. To date, such events have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, such an event could disrupt our operations, forgo revenue opportunities, potentially l ose market share, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple acknowledged a significant dependency on third-party developers whose support was crucial for maintaining customer interest in Apple's hardware ecosystem. However, due to Apple's minority market share and increasing regulatory pressure\u2014such as the EU's Digital Markets Act\u2014the company faced challenges in ensuring continued developer participation and content availability. By 2024, Apple responded by making substantial strategic and financial commitments, including $19.4 billion in unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs, much of which was tied to content production and talent acquisition. Additionally, Apple implemented structural changes to the App Store, including alternative payment mechanisms and new business terms in the EU, to attract and retain developers. These changes were directly linked to Apple\u2019s broader effort to secure third-party content and improve platform appeal, reflecting a shift from risk mitigation in 2022 to proactive investment in 2024.",

The  Company  is  also  subject  to  litigation  and  investigations  relating  to  the  App  Store,  which  have  resulted  in changes to the Company's business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.

          "chunk_text": "We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products that implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

By 2024, these figures had shifted to 2,969,258 for stockholder-approved plans and increased to 332,292 for non-stockholder-approved plans. This indicates a decrease in the reliance on the 1999 Plan (stockholder-approved) for maximum PSU payouts and a notable increase in the use of the 2001 Plan (non-stockholder-approved) for non-senior executives, suggesting a strategic shift in IBM's equity compensation structure over the two-year period.",

        "Hop 1: IBM(2022) \u2192 1999 Plan: IBM used the 1999 Plan for senior executives and also for non-senior executives, with a maximum PSU payout of 3,497,352 for stockholder-approved plans.",
        "Hop 2: 1999 Plan \u2192 2001 Plan: The 2001 Plan mirrored the 1999 Plan in structure but was used for non-senior executives, with a separate PSU payout quantity of 231,505 in 2022 for non-stockholder-approved plans.",

      "answer": "In 2022, QCOM noted that Chinese OEMs, influenced by the Made in China 2025 campaign targeting 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025, were increasingly developing their own integrated circuit products, which posed a risk to QCOM\u2019s semiconductor business. By 2024, this trend had intensified, with more Chinese OEMs either developing or planning to develop their own chips, reducing their reliance on QCOM\u2019s integrated circuit products. This evolution directly impacted QCOM\u2019s semiconductor revenue diversification strategy, which had aimed to reduce dependency on mobile handsets and expand into automotive and IoT sectors. Despite these efforts, the continued concentration of revenue from Chinese OEMs and the growing vertical integration by these companies increased QCOM\u2019s exposure to potential revenue loss, especially in the premium-tier device segment where QCOM\u2019s margins are higher.",

Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to those described in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in 'Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and 2021. Discussions of fiscal 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2021.\n\n## Our Business and Operating Segments\n\nWe develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\nFurther information regarding our business and operating segments is provided in 'Part I, Item 1.

      "answer": "In 2022, INTC had completed the first phase of the NAND business divestiture, selling the Fab Assets and NAND SSD Business to SK hynix, while retaining a contractual relationship through a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement. By 2024, INTC remained financially exposed to SK hynix through a contingent incentive and penalty structure tied to the NAND OpCo Business, with a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually and $1.5 billion in aggregate. Additionally, INTC still held a $2.0 billion receivable from SK hynix as of 2024, related to the remaining proceeds from the transaction. This indicates that while INTC exited direct ownership of the NAND manufacturing assets, it remained operationally and financially entangled with SK hynix through ongoing contractual obligations and performance-linked liabilities. The evolution reflects a strategic shift from asset ownership to a risk-sharing partnership model.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Broadcom's Symantec Cyber Security portfolio included Endpoint Security as one of its major offerings, positioned alongside Network Security, Information Security, and Identity Security. By 2023, Endpoint Security remained a key portfolio offering but was now explicitly subsumed under the broader 'Enterprise Security' category, which expanded to include Application Security and Compliance & Data Protection. This repositioning indicates a strategic shift toward integrated, comprehensive cybersecurity solutions that align with Broadcom's broader software transformation and its focus on delivering end-to-end security across applications, devices, and networks.",

        "Hop 3: Endpoint Security \u2190 AVGO(2023): In 2023, Endpoint Security was retained but reclassified under the broader 'Enterprise Security' portfolio, indicating a strategic integration."

      "question": "Given Apple's $74.2 billion in net sales from Greater China in 2022, how did the company's geographic inclusion of Taiwan within that region evolve into a more explicitly stated supply chain dependency on Taiwan by 2023?",
      "answer": "Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from Greater China in 2022, a region that includes Taiwan according to its 2022 10-K filing. While this geographic inclusion implies a financial stake in Taiwan, Apple's 2023 10-K elevated Taiwan from a sales region to a critical supply chain node, explicitly noting its reliance on the region for manufacturing operations. The 2023 filing highlights that Taiwan is one of the primary locations for outsourced manufacturing, and warns that geopolitical tensions or trade restrictions involving Taiwan could materially affect its business. While Apple does not explicitly state that the increased financial exposure in 2022 directly caused the increased operational focus in 2023, the logical inference is that the company's significant sales presence in Taiwan as part of Greater China laid the foundation for its later acknowledgment of supply chain dependency.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco classified hardware as a distinct performance obligation and recognized revenue upon transfer of control, which indicates that a significant portion of their sales involved hardware that was eligible for financing. This classification directly influenced the formation of loan receivables, as Cisco offered financing arrangements tied to the sale of hardware. By 2023, Cisco disclosed that loan receivables had an allowance for credit losses of $53M, down from $103M in 2022. This significant reduction suggests either improved credit quality of borrowers, tighter underwriting standards, or a strategic reduction in financing offered, all of which could be linked to the earlier classification of hardware sales and its downstream impact on financing risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States  requires  us  to  make  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Note  2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  describes  the  significant accounting  policies  and  methods  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  accounting  policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions,  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  and  actual  results  could  differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\n\nThe  inputs  into  certain  of  our  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  considered  the  economic  implications  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, including the associated impact of supply constraints, on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2022. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together  with  other  resources  that  are  readily  available  and  whether  our  commitment  to  transfer  the  product  or  service  to  the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\n\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  in  exchange  for  those  products  or  services.  Transfer  of  control  occurs  once  the customer  has  the  contractual  right  to  use  the  product,  generally  upon  shipment,  electronic  delivery  (or  when  the  software  is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control,  with  the  associated  software  maintenance  revenue  recognized  ratably  over  the  contract  term  as  services  and  software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\n\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to  for  the  promised  goods  or  services  based  on  standalone  selling  prices  (SSP).  SSP  is  estimated  for  each  distinct  performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n\nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's positioning of Office as facing competition from Proofpoint in 2022 evolve into a more explicitly framed competitive relationship in 2024, and what does this shift indicate about Microsoft's strategic emphasis on security within its productivity suite?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft's Office was shown to face competition from Proofpoint, among others, particularly in the realm of security solutions. By 2024, the competitive framing around Proofpoint sharpened, with Microsoft explicitly highlighting Proofpoint\u2019s role in email security, information protection, and governance as a competitive threat. This evolution suggests that Microsoft increasingly emphasized security as a core differentiator for Office, likely in response to rising enterprise demand for integrated security features within productivity tools. The shift from a general 'faces' relationship to an explicitly defined 'competes_with' relationship indicates a strategic pivot by Microsoft to position Office not just as a productivity tool, but as a secure, all-in-one enterprise solution.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "question": "How did Broadcom's investment in License Portability for VMware Cloud Foundation in 2023 influence the product's development trajectory and financial valuation in 2024 following the VMware acquisition?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Broadcom emphasized License Portability as a key feature within the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) suite, positioning it as a competitive differentiator that allowed customers to move VCF environments between on-premises and cloud endpoints. This feature was central to Broadcom\u2019s enterprise-wide license model aimed at reducing complexity and driving revenue growth. Following the VMware acquisition in 2024, Broadcom allocated $2,900 million in purchased intangible assets, a significant portion of which was tied to developed technologies including VCF. Specifically, $1,380 million of that amount was recognized in fiscal year 2024, reflecting the valuation uplift and strategic importance of VCF's License Portability feature. The financial valuation and continued development focus on VCF in 2024, including its integration with application management and security, indicate that the 2023 investment in License Portability directly influenced the product's expanded scope and financial treatment post-acquisition.",

The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash fl ows over the forecast period.\n\nCustomer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of products to existing customers of VMware. Customer contracts and related relationships were valued using the with-and-without-method under the income approach. In the withand-without method, the fair value was measured by the difference between the present values of the cash flows with and without the existing customers in place over the period of time necessary to reacquire the customers. The economic useful life was determined by evaluating many factors, including the useful l i fe of other intangible assets, the length of time remaining on the acquired contracts and the historical customer turnover rates.\n\nTrade name relates to the 'VMware' trade name. The fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the trade name. The economic useful life was determined based on the expected life of the trade name and the cash flows anticipated over the forecast period.\n\nOff-market component of customer contracts relate to rebates and marketing development funds provided to customers prior to the VMware Merger. We valued these contracts based on their remaining unamortized balances, which approximate their fair value. The economic useful life was determined based on the remaining terms of customer contracts.\n\nThe fair value of IPR&amp;D was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the IPR&amp;D, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AVGO did not disclose any specific allocation to municipal bonds within its Level 2 securities, as the focus was on valuation inputs like interest rates and broker quotes for less frequently traded assets. However, the UPS 2023 filing clarified that municipal bonds were typically categorized under Level 2 securities and valued using market-corroborated pricing or models with observable inputs like yield curves. By 2024, AVGO specifically disclosed $22 million in municipal bonds under Level 2 fixed-income securities, indicating a clearer allocation strategy while maintaining the same valuation methodology outlined in prior disclosures. This shows AVGO increased transparency in 2024 by explicitly reporting municipal bond holdings that were previously grouped under broader Level 2 categories.",

This agreement established the framework for wafer procurement. By 2023, the agreement remained in place through 2025, with GF committing to minimum annual capacity allocation and AMD agreeing to corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If AMD failed to meet these targets, it must pay a portion of the difference to GF. This contractual structure introduced a dual risk in 2023: if GF underperformed, AMD could face supply delays, but if AMD\u2019s demand fell short, it risked excess inventory and margin pressure. Thus, the 2022 agreement directly shaped AMD\u2019s 2023 supply chain risk exposure.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2022 influence its capital structure in 2023, particularly with respect to the integration of Activision\u2019s 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 into Microsoft\u2019s debt portfolio?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's announcement in January 2022 to acquire Activision Blizzard marked the beginning of strategic financial integration. Activision had previously issued the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, among other debt instruments, as evidenced by the October 27, 2023 supplemental indenture. By November 2023, Microsoft formally introduced these notes into its capital structure, as seen in the filing referencing the Indenture dated September 19, 2016, and filed on November 6, 2023. This indicates that Microsoft assumed or otherwise incorporated Activision\u2019s existing debt obligations as part of the acquisition process, thereby altering its capital structure by adding a new class of senior notes with a 3.400% interest rate maturing in 2026.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1\n\nWith  three  billion  people  actively  playing  games  today,  and  a  new  generation  steeped  in  interactive  entertainment,  Microsoft continues to invest in content, community, and cloud services. We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end,  from  the  way  games  are  created  and  distributed  to  how  they  are  played,  including  cloud  gaming  so  players  can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers, including the acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC. In January 2022, we announced  plans  to  acquire Activision  Blizzard,  Inc.,  a  leader  in  game  development  and  an  interactive  entertainment  content publisher. Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft's game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.\n\n## Our Future Opportunity\n\nThe case for digital transformation has never been more urgent. Customers are looking to us to help improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\n\n- Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.\n- Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n- Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer's behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication.\n- Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.\n- Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment.\n- Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more.\n\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n## Commitment to Sustainability\n\nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built  on  this  pledge  by  adding  commitments  to  be  water  positive  by  2030,  zero  waste  by  2030,  and  to  protect  ecosystems  by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nFiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due in substantial part to significant  global  datacenter  expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won't always be linear.",

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's increased revenue exposure to Taiwan in 2022 affect its supply chain risk profile related to foundry partners in 2023?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA's revenue from Taiwan increased significantly from $4,531 million in 2021 to $8,544 million in 2022, indicating a growing business presence in the region. By 2023, NVIDIA's 10-K filing explicitly highlighted that geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan and China, where it has 'suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners,' could have a 'material adverse impact' on its supply chain. This suggests that the increased revenue exposure in 2022 likely heightened NVIDIA's operational reliance on Taiwan-based foundry partners, thereby amplifying its supply chain risk profile in 2023. The connection is further reinforced by Qualcomm's 2023 filing, which emphasized that 'foundry partners in Taiwan' are critical to the semiconductor supply chain, and any disruption would severely impact chipset supply.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA(2022) \u2192 Taiwan: Revenue from Taiwan nearly doubled from $4,531M (2021) to $8,544M (2022), indicating increased business exposure.",
        "Hop 2: Taiwan \u2192 Foundry Partners: Qualcomm's 2023 filing notes that 'foundry partners in Taiwan' are critical to the semiconductor supply chain and that geopolitical tensions could severely limit chipset supply.",

      "question": "How did the decline in Advanced Services' gross margin impact Cisco's financing strategy for services in 2023, particularly regarding the reduction in loan receivables credit loss allowance from $103M in 2022 to $53M in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco reported that changes in service gross margin were influenced by shifts in the mix between technical support services and Advanced Services, indicating margin pressure on the latter. In 2023, Cisco disclosed that Advanced Services were being offered as part of financing arrangements, including loan receivables, which are extended to customers for the sale of services. By 2023, the credit loss allowance for loan receivables dropped significantly from $103M in 2022 to $53M in 2023. This reduction suggests tighter credit controls, improved collection performance, or a strategic shift in financing risk associated with Advanced Services, potentially reflecting a response to earlier margin pressures by adjusting financing terms or customer eligibility.",

          "chunk_text": "- Our ability to reduce production costs\n- Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development\n- Sales discounts\n- Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e. component costs, broker fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those currently impacting the market for components, including semiconductors and memory, and which costs have in the past and may continue to be exacerbated by inflation\n- Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges\n- Changes in shipment volume\n- The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals\n- Increased costs (including those caused by tariffs or economic conditions, including inflation), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering  does  not  correctly  anticipate  product  demand  or  if  the  financial  health  of  either  contract  manufacturers  or suppliers deteriorates\n- Lower than expected benefits from value engineering\n- Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China\n- Changes in distribution channels\n- Increased warranty or royalty costs\n- Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions\n- How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans\n\nChanges in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.\n\n## Sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition.\n\nSales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Secure, Agile Networks and Collaboration products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service provider product orders decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of  expanding  network  infrastructures;  the  availability  of  funding;  and  the  extent  to  which  service  providers  are  affected  by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result  of  any  slowdown  in  capital  expenditures  by  service  providers  (which  may  be  more  prevalent  during  a  global  economic downturn,  or  periods  of  economic,  political  or  regulatory  uncertainty),  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in  the  past,  many  of  our  service  provider  customers  have  been  materially  and  adversely  affected  by  slowdowns  in  the  general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability,  resulting  in  business  failures  and  substantial  reductions  in  spending  and  expansion  plans.  These  conditions  have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.  Finally,  service  provider  customers  typically  have  longer  implementation  cycles;  require  a  broader  range  of  services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\n\n## Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\n\nIf  we  fail  to  manage  distribution  of  our  products  and  services  properly,  or  if  our  distributors'  financial  condition  or  operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial  portion  of  our  products  and  services  is  sold through  our  channel  partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Our  channel  partners  include  systems  integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple identified China Mainland as a critical part of its supply chain and acknowledged significant exposure to risks including geopolitical tensions, tariffs, and public health disruptions like the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company noted that tensions between the U.S. and China had already led to increased tariffs, which impacted gross margins and posed risks to product competitiveness. In 2024, while Apple still categorized Greater China (which includes China Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) as a distinct and strategically managed segment, there was no explicit mention of efforts to reduce dependency on China Mainland for manufacturing, suggesting continued operational reliance on the region despite earlier risks. The evolution of Apple's geographic risk exposure appears to reflect a balancing act: maintaining strategic presence in the region for both production and sales while managing external threats, though no specific mitigation steps or shifts in revenue concentration were disclosed in the filings.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "question": "How did Cisco's increased issuance of senior fixed-rate notes from $9.0 billion in 2022 to $13.5 billion in 2024 impact the structure and risk profile of its commercial paper notes program, particularly in relation to interest rate sensitivity and hedging strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco had $9.0 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding, with a fair value of $9.7 billion, and a 50 BPS interest rate change impacting the fair value by $0.3 billion. By 2024, Cisco significantly increased its senior notes issuance to $13.5 billion. This expansion was accompanied by interest rate hedging strategies, including a $0.5 billion interest rate swap converting fixed rates to floating rates based on SOFR, likely aimed at mitigating interest rate risk across both senior notes and commercial paper notes. The 2024 commercial paper program was maintained under a $15.0 billion short-term financing facility, with effective rates incorporating hedging adjustments. The increased fixed-rate debt in 2024 likely heightened the interconnectedness and risk sensitivity between long-term senior notes and short-term commercial paper, necessitating more active hedging and rate management.",

This established a framework for structured debt issuance under a consistent regulatory and legal architecture. By 2024, Microsoft extended this strategy by issuing new notes (e.g., 2.400% Notes due 2026, 3.450% Notes due 2036) under the same Base Indenture, as evidenced by the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. BNY Mellon remained a central partner in this process, maintaining its role as Trustee in the foundational indenture structure. This continuity in indenture documentation and trustee relationship demonstrates that Microsoft leveraged its earlier structured debt framework, including the 2.95% Notes due 2014, as a model for its 2024 debt issuance strategy, ensuring consistency in legal terms, regulatory compliance, and investor trust.",

      "question": "How does Adobe's increase in foreign exchange hedge notional amount from $749 million in 2022 to $9.9 billion in 2024 reflect a strategic evolution in managing forecasted transaction risks through option contracts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe reported a long-term investment exposure of $749 million related to foreign subsidiaries and used foreign exchange options and forwards to hedge forecasted revenue in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and Australian Dollars, with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). By 2024, Adobe's notional amount of foreign exchange cash flow hedges had increased significantly to $9.9 billion, indicating a substantial expansion in their hedging program. This growth aligns with a broader use of option contracts to manage forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions, with gains and losses deferred in AOCI and recognized in earnings as the transactions occur. The shift from a relatively modest hedge exposure in 2022 to a much larger and more structured program by 2024 reflects a strategic evolution in Adobe\u2019s approach to managing forecasted transaction risks, likely driven by increased global revenue exposure and a more proactive risk management posture.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $749 million and $598 million, respectively, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue\n\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros,  British  Pounds,  Japanese  Yen  and Australian  Dollars.  We  hedge  these  cash  flow  exposures  to  reduce  the  risk  that  our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\n\nWe record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue in accumulated other comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  until  the  forecasted  transaction  occurs.  When  the  forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue. For the fiscal year ended December 3, 2021, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\n\n## Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\n\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At December 3, 2021, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.\n\nSee  Note  6  of  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  information  regarding  our  derivative  financial instruments.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\n## Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities\n\nAt December 3, 2021, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.95 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 3, 2021, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a $27 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $14 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nAs of December 3, 2021, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore do not  subject  us  to  financial  statement  risk  associated  with  changes  in  interest  rates. As  of  December  3,  2021,  the  total  carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.12 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $4.29 billion.\n\nSee Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.",

The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "answer": "Microsoft's Server Products and Cloud Services revenue increased significantly from $79.97 billion in 2023 to $97.73 billion in 2024. This growth was supported by the continued licensing of Client Access Licenses (CALs), which provide access rights to SQL Server and Windows Server. As part of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, CALs are directly tied to server product revenue and are essential for enabling customer access to these core server offerings.

      "question": "How did Microsoft's use of trustee entities for its 4.50% Notes due 2040 evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's broader indenture management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft used The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as the trustee for its 4.50% Notes due 2040. By 2024, subsequent supplemental indentures show Microsoft working more frequently with U.S. Bank National Association for newer note issuances, while still referencing the original indenture with BNY Mellon. This indicates a strategic shift toward diversifying trustee relationships under the umbrella of the original indenture framework, allowing Microsoft greater flexibility in debt issuance administration without renegotiating core trust terms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MSFT(2023) \u2192 4.50% Notes due 2040: Microsoft issued 4.50% Notes due 2040 under a Second Supplemental Indenture dated September 27, 2010, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as Trustee.",
        "Hop 2: 4.50% Notes due 2040 \u2192 BNY Mellon: BNY Mellon served as the trustee for these notes under the Base Indenture from May 18, 2009, and subsequent supplements, indicating regulatory and administrative oversight.",
        "Hop 3: BNY Mellon \u2190 MSFT(2024): In 2024, Microsoft continued to reference the original indenture with BNY Mellon while increasingly using U.S. Bank National Association as trustee for newer note issuances, suggesting a strategic evolution in trustee management."

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft disclosed that $986 million of convertible senior notes issued by Nuance remained outstanding, with $985 million redeemed prior to June 30, 2022, leaving $1 million included in other current liabilities. By 2023, Microsoft reported that 'substantially all' of these notes had been redeemed, indicating a near-complete resolution of this liability. This reduction in outstanding notes likely contributed to a cleaner balance sheet for the Intelligent Cloud segment, which had been assigned goodwill tied to Nuance's integration. The redemption progression from $1 million remaining in 2022 to nearly full redemption by 2023 reflects improved financial integration and reduced contingent obligations within the segment.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

We value these securities based on pricing from independent pricing vendors who use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that model information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly in determining fair value, including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. We therefore categorize all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as Level 2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded.\n\nThe fair values of our money market funds, time deposits and deferred compensation plan assets, which consist of money market and other mutual funds, are based on quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date.\n\nOur over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives are valued using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign exchange and interest rate data at the measurement date.\n\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approx imate their carrying values.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nThe fair value of our senior notes was $5.51 billion as of November 29, 2024, based on observable market prices in less active markets and categorized as Level 2.

      "question": "How did Apple's increased reliance on China Mainland's manufacturing ecosystem in 2022 relate to the moderately higher proportion of iPhone revenue in the Greater China segment in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Apple explicitly stated that a majority of its manufacturing was performed by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, with China Mainland being a key hub. This dependency on China Mainland made Apple vulnerable to disruptions such as trade tensions, tariffs, and public health issues, all of which could impact production costs and timelines. In 2023, Apple reported that iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales specifically in the Greater China segment, which includes China Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The increased presence of iPhone sales in this region may reflect a strategic focus on a market where Apple has deep manufacturing integration, allowing for more efficient product delivery and localized marketing. The alignment between manufacturing dependency and revenue concentration suggests a coordinated strategy to optimize supply chain proximity and regional demand. This relationship required understanding Apple\u2019s operational reliance on China Mainland (2022), the geographic composition of the Greater China segment, and the specific revenue shift in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Adobe identified social media platforms like Facebook as key competitors in the digital media space, citing their integrated content creation and sharing capabilities as a growing threat (ADBE_10k_2023.pdf, p.8). This competitive pressure directly informed Adobe's 2024 strategic focus on expanding AI-powered tools like Adobe Express, which enables task-based creativity and seamless content sharing (ADBE_10k_2024.pdf, p.4). Meta's 2023 filings show Facebook's continued emphasis on enabling content sharing through features like Reels, Stories, and Groups, reinforcing the need for Adobe to differentiate its offerings (META_10k_2023.pdf, p.7). In response, Adobe not only enhanced its AI capabilities but also emphasized collaboration features in Creative Cloud to counter the ease of use and viral nature of social media content creation. This shift reflects a direct competitive strategy to maintain Adobe's leadership in digital media by integrating AI to lower barriers to creativity while improving real-time collaboration features.",

We believe we are well positioned to deliver value in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience strategic areas where our mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences has never been more relevant as people seek new ways to create, collaborate and communicate and businesses continue to invest in digital transformation.\n\n## SEGMENTS\n\nOur business is organized into three reportable segments:\n\n- Digital Media;\n- Digital Ex perience; and\n- Publishing and Advertising.\n\nThese segments provide Adobe's senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities further described below, and our legacy products, services and solutions are contained within the third segment, Publishing and Advertising.\n\n## MARKET OVERVIEW\n\nThis overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2025 and beyond for each of our segments. See the section titled 'Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 titled 'Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' and Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report for further segment information.\n\n## Digital Media\n\n## Opportunity\n\nIn today's digital world, content and digital documents are fueling the global economy, and productivity, design and creativity have never been more relevant, providing a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. Everyone has a story to tell and needs products and services at their fingertips to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvases. AI- and generative AI-powered technologies are increasing this opportunity by growing the demand for and production of content. This shift is changing how creative professionals work by accelerating their processes, increasing their productivity, and allowing them to explore and create in new fields, while empowering new creators by dramatically lowering barriers to creativity. At the same time, creativity is increasingly a team effort that is redefining productivity, making quick and easy collaboration even more critical to every company's success. Adobe is driving innovation to shape these trends, democratize creativity, empower individuals to create wherever inspiration strikes and enable more effective collaboration between creators and stakeholders.\n\nThe  flagship  of  our  Digital  Media  business  is Adobe  Creative  Cloud,  a  subscription  service  that  allows  subscribers  to  use  our  creative  products  and applications ('Apps') integrated with cloud-delivered services across various surfaces and platforms. We believe in creativity for all, and Creative Cloud addresses the needs of all content creators, from creative professionals, such as artists, designers, developers, students, and administrators, to knowledge workers, marketers, educators,  enthusiasts,  communicators,  and  consumers.  Our  customers  rely  on  our  products  for  content  creation,  photo  editing,  design,  video  and  animation production, mobile App and gaming development, and more. Our customers can choose between products optimized for different platforms and capabilities, from the speed and ease of use offered by Adobe Express, our AI-first, task-based web and mobile App, to the greater power and precision of our flagship Creative Cloud Apps.  We believe we have significant opportunities to grow our  Digital  Media business by advancing every creative category across all surfaces; expanding content-first, task-based creativity with Adobe Express; enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders; inspiring the creative community through sharing and monetization; and expanding the user base of our tools through the infusion of AI into our products, services and solutions to enable users of any skill level to easily and efficiently create content.\n\nOur  Digital  Media  segment  includes  our Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  a  unified,  cloud-based  document  services  platform  that  integrates Adobe's pioneering PDF technology with our Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Acrobat Sign Apps to deliver fully digital document workflows across all surfaces. We have the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud and transform how people view, share, collaborate, and engage with documents. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, reflecting the important role PDF plays globally. There are hundreds of millions of users who engage with PDF files on a daily basis in industries such as legal, financial services, and publishing, as well as a broad array of communicators and Adobe Acrobat Reader customers who use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat Apps and the document services platform in Adobe Document Cloud.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft's Enterprise Agreements explicitly included Software Assurance (SA) as part of the licensing offering for medium or large organizations over a three-year period. By 2023, SA remained a key component, but Microsoft began emphasizing unearned revenue treatment for SA, recognizing revenue ratably over the coverage period for multi-year agreements. This shift reflects a more formalized revenue recognition approach for SA, particularly as unearned revenue now included SA alongside cloud services under multi-year volume licensing programs. The evolution shows how Microsoft aligned its accounting policy for SA with broader financial reporting standards, particularly in how it recognized revenue over time rather than upfront.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft explicitly listed 'Enterprise Support Services' as part of its Intelligent Cloud segment, indicating a focus on customer support and consulting as a key component of its enterprise offerings. By 2024, this offering was grouped under the broader 'Enterprise and partner services' category, which also included Industry Solutions, Nuance professional services, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience. Despite this reorganization, the financial performance of 'Enterprise and partner services' showed a slight decline from $7.605 billion in 2022 to $7.594 billion in 2024, suggesting that the strategic expansion into a more comprehensive service offering did not result in immediate revenue growth.

This segment primarily comprises:\n\n- Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n- Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance professional services.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform  or  device.  Customers  can  use Azure  through  our  global  network  of  datacenters  for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-aservice consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nOur server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating  system.  This  includes  the  server  platform,  database,  business  intelligence,  storage,  management  and  operations, virtualization,  service-oriented  architecture  platform,  security,  and  identity  software.  We  also  license  standalone  and  software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform  and  code  hosting  service  for  developers.  Server  products  revenue  is  mainly  affected  by  purchases  through  volume licensing  programs,  licenses  sold  to  original  equipment  manufacturers  ('OEM'),  and  retail  packaged  products.  CALs  provide access  rights  to  certain  server  products,  including  SQL  Server  and  Windows  Server,  and  revenue  is  reported  along  with  the associated server product.\n\nNuance and GitHub include both cloud and on-premises offerings. Nuance provides healthcare and enterprise AI solutions. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers.\n\n## Enterprise Services\n\nEnterprise  Services,  including  Enterprise  Support  Services,  Microsoft  Consulting  Services,  and  Nuance  Professional  Services, assist  customers  in  developing,  deploying,  and  managing  Microsoft  server  solutions,  Microsoft  desktop  solutions,  and  Nuance conversational  AI  and  ambient  intelligent  solutions,  along  with  providing  training  and  certification  to  developers  and  IT professionals on various Microsoft products.\n\n## Competition\n\nAzure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure's competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud's global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.\n\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own  versions  of  the  Unix  operating  system  preinstalled  on  server  hardware.  Nearly  all  computer  manufacturers  offer  server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux  has  also  benefited  from  the  large  number  of  compatible  applications  now  produced  by  many  commercial  and  noncommercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.",

      "question": "How did AMD's shift in debt structure between its 7.50% Senior Notes in 2022 and the 2.125% Notes in 2023 reflect changes in its capital strategy and financial positioning?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD had $312 million outstanding in 7.50% Senior Notes, which carried higher interest costs and were set to mature in August 2022. These notes ranked equally with the 2.125% Notes and were subject to potential repurchase or redemption under certain conditions. By 2023, AMD had significantly reduced its holdings in the 2.125% Notes from $1 million to $0, indicating a strategic move to retire or restructure higher-cost debt. This evolution suggests AMD optimized its capital structure by reducing high-interest liabilities, likely leveraging its $500 million revolving credit facility or other lower-cost financing options to improve liquidity and financial flexibility.",

The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes was $312 million.\n\nPrior to August 15, 2022, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a 'make whole' premium (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture). Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.50% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the 7.50% Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.50% Notes.\n\n## Debt Covenants and Seniority\n\nThe  7.50%  Notes  require  the  Company  to  comply  with  certain  financial  covenants  and  a  number  of  restrictive covenants. The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank equally with the Company's existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of the Company's future subordinated debt. The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank junior to all of the  Company's  future  senior  secured  debt  to  the  extent  of  the  collateral  securing  such  debt  and  are  structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes\n\nThe Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nThe Company is party to a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), including a $50 million swingline sub-facility and a $75 million sublimit for letters of credit pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in June 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the base rate at the Company's option (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. As of December 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants.

      "answer": "In 2023, Cisco reported a 29% decrease in inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, reflecting ongoing optimization efforts to balance supply chain flexibility and inventory obsolescence risk. By 2024, Cisco disclosed a $1.6 billion increase in the notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, rising from $8.3 billion to $9.9 billion, as part of its strategy to hedge firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. The evidence suggests Cisco may have shifted strategic focus from securing supply through firm commitments to managing currency exposure associated with global supply chain activities, aligning with its stated objective of reducing earnings and cash flow fluctuations due to exchange rate changes.",

The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

As of the signing of the Merger Agreement, the transaction was valued at $35 billion. The actual valuation of the transaction could differ significantly from the estimated amount due to movements in the price of our common stock, the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding on the closing date of the Merger and other factors. The closing of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval. On April 7, 2021, our stockholders voted to approve all the proposals relating to the Merger at a special meeting of stockholders. Xilinx stockholders also voted to approve their respective proposals relating to the Merger at a Xilinx special meeting held on the same day. The Merger is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Our Industry\n\nWe are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated  circuit  (IC)  is  a  semiconductor  device  that  consists  of  many  interconnected  transistors  on  a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nAMD is focused on high performance computing technology, software and product leadership. Our strategy is to create and  deliver  the  world's  leading  high-performance  CPUs  and  GPUs,  and  to  integrate  these  CPUs  and  GPUs  with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions. We invest in high-performance CPUs for client systems, as well as for high performance computing solutions, cloud infrastructure and the private and public cloud environment. We also invest in high-performance GPUs and software for markets such as gaming, compute, artificial intelligence, cloud gaming, and virtual and augmented reality. We combine our high-performance CPUs and GPUs to deliver solutions that are differentiated at the chip level, such as our semi-custom SoCs and APUs, and at the solution level, such as PC and server platforms.\n\n## Computing and Graphics Markets\n\nOur Computing and Graphics products address the need for computational and visual data processing in computing devices that include personal computers, laptops / notebooks, and workstations. In the PC market, we design CPUs, APUs  and  GPUs  for  consumer  and  commercial  desktops,  notebooks  and  workstations.  Our  CPUs  and  APUs  are designed  to  bring  performance,  efficiency  and  modern  security  features  to  gamers,  creators,  consumers  and commercial enterprises. Our GPUs address the need for improved visual and data processing in various computing devices.\n\nMany consumers use PCs as entertainment platforms, in addition to traditional productivity and communications uses, and  therefore  value  a  richer,  more  visually  compelling  and  immersive  experience.  As  a  result,  visual  realism  and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to the increased creation and use of processing-intensive multimedia content for playing games, capturing media, viewing online videos, editing photos and managing digital content on computing devices. In turn, these trends have contributed to  higher  consumer  demand for performance graphics solutions and to manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities. Our CPUs and APUs bring performance, efficiency and modern security features to gamers, creators, consumers and enterprises. Industries that utilize computer assisted design (CAD), that develop content for media and entertainment markets and that generate professional visualizations and renderings can benefit greatly from graphics solutions optimized for the professional graphics market.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from the Greater China segment, which includes China Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, indicating a significant revenue concentration in the region. This segment was managed as a single geographic unit, with China Mainland being a core component. By 2024, Apple's manufacturing operations remained heavily concentrated in China Mainland, despite efforts to expand in other countries like India and Vietnam. This continued reliance on China Mainland for manufacturing, despite its geopolitical and supply chain risks, suggests that Apple's geographic diversification strategy has not significantly reduced its operational exposure to the region, even as it maintains substantial revenue dependence on Greater China.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\n## Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\n## Note 13 - Segment Information and G eographic Data\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the A mericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of A sia Pacific. A mericas includes both North and South A merica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the M iddle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and T aiwan.

A lthough the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company's customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists  of  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales,  and  operating  ex penses  directly   attributable  to  the  segment.

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD's APU products were heavily dependent on a limited number of suppliers for critical materials and substrates, with some components only available from sole suppliers. This created risks around manufacturing yield inefficiencies and supply shortages, which could increase per-unit costs and adversely affect gross margins. These constraints were compounded by AMD's reliance on AIB partners to distribute and support APU products in the market. By 2024, while AMD continued to depend on AIB partners for product distribution, the earlier supply chain bottlenecks likely contributed to tighter inventory controls and increased sensitivity to price protection clauses, as seen in the 2024 filings. This evolution suggests that supply chain limitations in 2022 had a lasting impact on AMD's go-to-market strategy and gross margin stability through its AIB partner network in 2024.",

Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU  products.  Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.",

Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties that we incorporate into our software or hardware. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or dev elopment or testing tools av ailable to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not av ailable with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adv ersely affected.\n\n## We  depend  on  third-party  companies  for  the  design,  manufacture  and  supply  of  motherboards,  software,  memory  and  other  computer platform components to support our business and products.\n\nWe depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, driv ers, AI models or tools), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product  offerings.  We  also  rely  on  our  AIB  partners  to  support  our  products.  In  addition,  our  microprocessors  are  not  designed  to  function  with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adv ersely affected.\n\n## If  we  los e  Micros oft  Corporation's   s upport  for  our  products   or  other  s oftware  vendors   do  not  des ign  and  develop  s oftware  to  run  on  our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innov ate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and dev eloping its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and dev elop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software prov iders designing and dev eloping software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to dev elop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software prov iders may forego designing their software applications to take adv antage of our innov ations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software driv ers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driv er, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software v endors, our ability to market our products would be materially adv ersely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for  conv enience by either party upon prior notice.  T hese agreements are non-exclusiv e and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors' products.

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft's Office faced increasing competition from Cisco Systems, which was leveraging its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. By 2023, this competitive pressure remained, with Cisco continuing to be listed as a key competitor to Office, particularly in collaboration and communication tools. Microsoft responded by emphasizing the integration and flexibility of its productivity suite, including cloud-based services like Teams, which competes directly with Cisco\u2019s Webex platform. This strategic shift was reflected in Microsoft\u2019s focus on providing secure, integrated, and industry-specific solutions that work well with existing customer technologies, both on-premises and in the cloud, to maintain its market leadership.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement.

Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's dependency on Chinese OEMs in 2022 influence its integrated circuit production commitments by 2024, particularly in light of potential vertical integration by those OEMs and Qualcomm's multi-year capacity purchase obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm identified a significant portion of its revenue as being dependent on Chinese OEMs, many of whom were under pressure from the Chinese government's Made in China 2025 campaign to develop their own integrated circuit products. This posed a risk of vertical integration that could reduce Qualcomm's semiconductor sales. By 2024, Qualcomm had multi-year capacity purchase commitments totaling $12.8 billion for integrated circuit products, with $3.0 billion in advance payments recorded on its balance sheet. These figures indicate that despite the risk of OEMs developing their own chips, Qualcomm increased its production commitments, likely to secure supply chain stability and maintain market position amid evolving OEM strategies and geopolitical tensions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: QCOM(2022) \u2192 Chinese OEMs: Qualcomm derived a significant portion of its revenues from Chinese OEMs, which were under pressure to develop their own integrated circuit products due to policies like Made in China 2025.",
        "Hop 2: Chinese OEMs \u2192 Integrated Circuit Products: The potential vertical integration by Chinese OEMs posed a risk to Qualcomm's semiconductor business, as OEMs could shift away from Qualcomm's products to in-house solutions.",
        "Hop 3: Integrated Circuit Products \u2190 QCOM(2024): By 2024, Qualcomm had $12.8 billion in total purchase obligations for integrated circuit products, including $3.0 billion in advance payments, indicating continued strategic investment in production capacity despite the risk of OEM self-sufficiency."

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' References to 'and,' 'or' and 'and/or' should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies - Concentrations.'\n\nIn addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand, elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), or a shift in share away",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was nine years and eight years, respectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $184 million, $204 million and $207 million, respectively. At September 29, 2024, other assets included $719 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $708 million recorded in other liabilities. At September 24, 2023, other assets included $612 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $571 million recorded in other liabilities.\n\nAt September 29, 2024, future lease payments under our operating leases were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did Cisco's shift from a $15.0 billion commercial paper program in 2023 to the issuance of $13.5 billion in senior fixed-rate notes in 2024 reflect a change in its debt financing strategy, particularly in relation to interest rate risk management through hedging?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Cisco maintained a $15.0 billion short-term commercial paper program used for general corporate purposes. By 2024, the company shifted toward issuing $13.5 billion in senior fixed-rate notes, indicating a strategic move toward longer-term financing. This shift was accompanied by the use of interest rate swaps on $0.5 billion of fixed-rate notes, converting them to floating rates based on SOFR to manage interest rate risk. The senior notes ranked at par with the commercial paper notes, suggesting a deliberate rebalancing of debt structure to optimize risk and cost. This evolution shows Cisco adapting its capital structure by blending short- and long-term instruments while actively hedging exposure.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Qualcomm identified generative AI as a key enabler for immersive, intuitive, and interactive experiences across mobile and IoT, including XR. This strategic emphasis on AI-driven innovation laid the groundwork for the expansion of XR capabilities, particularly in consumer IoT such as voice and music, tablets, and PCs. By 2024, this investment materialized into tangible product offerings, with XR being explicitly listed as a core consumer IoT application within Qualcomm\u2019s QCT semiconductor business. The inclusion of XR in the 2024 revenue breakdown under consumer IoT indicates a direct evolution from AI strategy in 2023 to product realization in 2024. Analysts also noted that by 2024, 22% of PCs sold were AI-capable, aligning with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Series platforms that support on-device AI processing\u2014key for XR applications. This shows a clear 3-hop progression: Qualcomm\u2019s 2023 AI strategy \u2192 generative AI enabling XR \u2192 Qualcomm\u2019s 2024 XR product revenue contribution.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's Server Products and Cloud Services revenue increased from $79.97 billion in 2023 to $97.726 billion in 2024, reflecting a significant growth of $17.756 billion. This growth was primarily driven by Azure's expansion in cloud and AI offerings, including infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and AI-optimized infrastructure that enabled customers to develop next-generation applications. Azure's role as a comprehensive cloud platform with capabilities in computing, networking, storage, AI, IoT, and machine learning was central to this growth. Additionally, Microsoft Cloud revenue, which includes Azure, reached $137.4 billion in 2024, up from $111.6 billion in 2023, further validating Azure's contribution to the increased performance of the Server Products and Cloud Services segment.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices.

Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software.

By fiscal year 2023, Microsoft maintained this competitive framing but placed increased emphasis on cloud-based productivity tools and comprehensive solutions that align with their broader ecosystem, including Azure and Teams. The 2023 filing specifically highlighted Microsoft's ability to offer 'powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools' that work well with existing technologies. This evolution suggests a strategic pivot toward leveraging Microsoft's cloud infrastructure and integrated platforms to differentiate against Slack, which could enhance enterprise collaboration revenue by deepening customer lock-in and increasing cross-sell opportunities within Microsoft's ecosystem.",

We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's Server Products and Cloud Services revenue grew from $79,970 million in 2023 to $97,726 million in 2024, representing a 35% increase. This growth was driven in part by expanded use of Azure and related cloud services, which are closely supported by development tools like Visual Studio. In 2024, Visual Studio was explicitly listed as part of the Server Products and Cloud Services segment and reported as a revenue contributor, indicating its strategic importance in enabling developers to build and deploy applications on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure. This evolution shows how Microsoft has increasingly positioned Visual Studio not only as a development platform but also as a direct enabler and revenue generator within its broader cloud services growth strategy.",

      "answer": "Cisco's technical support services, which saw improved gross margins in 2023 due to lower headcount and delivery costs, are directly tied to loan receivables through financing arrangements offered to customers. In 2024, the company reported $41 million in net write-offs for loan receivables, which suggests that despite stronger service performance in the prior year, actual credit losses materialized. This indicates that while 2023's improved service delivery may have supported increased financing activity, it did not fully prevent credit risk realization in 2024, as seen in the elevated write-offs.",

        "Hop 1: CSCO(2023) \u2192 Technical Support Services: Gross margin increased by 1.7 percentage points due to lower headcount and delivery costs.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') is intended to help  the  reader  understand  the  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  of  Microsoft  Corporation.  MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. For a discussion of the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, please refer to Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.\n\nWe  generate  revenue  by  offering  a  wide  range  of  cloud-based  and  other  services  to  people  and  businesses;  licensing  and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.\n\nHighlights from fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 included:\n\n- Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue increased 32% to $91.2 billion.\n- Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 18%.\n- Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 59.7 million.\n- LinkedIn revenue increased 34%.\n- Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 39%.\n- Server products and cloud services revenue increased 28% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 45%.\n- Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing ('Windows OEM') revenue increased 11%.\n- Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11%.\n- Xbox content and services revenue increased 3%.\n- Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 27%.\n- Surface revenue increased 3%.\n\nOn March 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. ('Nuance') for a total purchase price of $18.8 billion,  consisting  primarily  of  cash.  Nuance  is  a  cloud  and  artificial  intelligence  ('AI')  software  provider  with  healthcare  and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 - Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft's Office suite directly competed with Meta as part of a broader set of productivity and collaboration tools, with LinkedIn offering enterprise-focused solutions like Talent, Marketing, and Sales Solutions that competed with Meta's professional networking and advertising offerings. LinkedIn had over 850 million members and was central to Microsoft\u2019s enterprise differentiation strategy. By 2023, the competitive scope expanded as Microsoft now explicitly called out Meta as a competitor not only in search advertising but also in gaming ecosystems. This evolution reflects a broader strategic overlap where Microsoft\u2019s enterprise differentiation through LinkedIn was complemented by a more aggressive stance in consumer-facing segments like gaming and digital advertising, where Meta was increasingly active.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement.

Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.

These loan receivables formed a significant part of Cisco\u2019s financing arrangements, which decreased by 2% compared to the end of fiscal 2023. By fiscal 2024, the credit loss allowance for loan receivables had dropped to $53 million from $103 million in fiscal 2022, indicating a reduction in expected defaults.

These notes were later linked to the Assumed Xilinx Notes, which AMD had guaranteed following the acquisition of Xilinx, totaling $1.5 billion in aggregate principal. By 2024, AMD's guarantee of the Xilinx Notes imposed additional restrictions on its operations, including limitations on creating liens, entering into sale and leaseback transactions, and merging or selling assets. These covenants, combined with existing debt obligations like the 2.950% Notes, constrained AMD's financial flexibility and increased the risk of cross-defaults under its broader debt agreements.",

The acquisition included Activision Blizzard\u2019s existing debt instruments, such as the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026. In 2024, Microsoft filed a new Indenture agreement dated November 6, 2023, under which it assumed responsibility for these notes through a supplemental indenture with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. This structural change indicates that Microsoft integrated Activision Blizzard\u2019s debt obligations into its own capital structure, aligning the management of these notes with its broader debt portfolio.",

      "question": "Given Microsoft's overall growth in cloud services revenue, what does the decline in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue from $7,900 million in 2023 to $7,594 million in 2024 suggest about the strategic prioritization of Enterprise Support Services?",
      "answer": "The decline in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue from $7,900 million in 2023 to $7,594 million in 2024, despite Microsoft's broader growth in cloud services like Azure, raises questions about the strategic prioritization of Enterprise Support Services\u2014a key component of that category. Since Enterprise Support Services is explicitly included within Enterprise and Partner Services in both years, the drop suggests a potential reduction in focus or investment in this offering relative to other cloud services that saw stronger growth. This could indicate a reallocation of resources toward higher-growth areas or a shift in customer demand away from traditional enterprise support models.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD's operations heavily depended on third-party manufacturers like TSMC and UMC for critical semiconductor fabrication, particularly for its 7 nm and lower-node microprocessor and GPU portfolio. These manufacturers were responsible for implementing leading-edge process technologies, but faced disruptions and inefficiencies during production, including delays in transitioning to smaller process nodes. These inefficiencies directly led to lower manufacturing yields, increasing per-unit production costs for AMD in 2024. As a result, AMD experienced a negative impact on its gross margins, as noted in the 2024 filings, due to both higher production costs and potential supply constraints affecting customer fulfillment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## If es s ential equipment, materials , s ubs trates  or manufacturing proces s es  are not available to manufacture our products , we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing serv ice prov iders from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliv eries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials of acceptable quality on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely deliv ery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials of acceptable quality in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are av ailable only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to prov ide the majority of certain types of IC packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently av ailable from only a limited number of suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of memory, equipment, materials or substrates of acceptable quality on an ongoing  basis  and  at  reasonable  costs  to  meet  our  production  requirements,  we  could  experience  a  shortage  in  memory,  equipment,  materials  or substrate  supply  or  an  increase  in  production  costs,  which  could  hav e  a  material  adv erse  effect  on  our  business.  We  hav e  long-term  purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If the deliv ery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required v olume of supply to meet customer demand. Conv ersely, if we ov erestimate our customer demand or experience a decrease in customer demand, either because customers cancel orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, it could result in excess inv entory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we hav e prepayment arrangements with certain suppliers. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplier for another.\n\nFrom time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price, quality and av ailability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in v arious essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adv ersely affected.\n\n## Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design, process technology and packaging technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, packaging technology failures, process technology failures or a combination of some or all of  these.  Our  third-party  manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers.  If our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achiev e acceptable yields or we may experience product deliv ery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to dev elop, expand, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge manufacturing process or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely  basis  or  that  our  competitors  will  not  dev elop  new  technologies,  products  or  processes  earlier .  Moreov er ,  during  periods  when  our  third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or packaging technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productiv e. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could hav e a material adv erse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effectiv e technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adv erse effect on our business. Moreov er, we rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitiv e performance attributes for our  IC products.  T herefore, the foundries, particularly  TSMC which manufactures our newest  IC products, must be able to transition to adv anced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliv er them in a timely manner.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adv ersely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate  our  reduced  product  supply  amongst  our  customers,  which  could  harm  our  relationships  and  reputation  with  our  customers  and  materially adversely affect our business.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's relationship with Wells Fargo Bank in 2023 connect to its stake in Activision Blizzard, Inc. in 2024, particularly in light of Activision's ongoing debt obligations administered by Wells Fargo and Microsoft's decision to exclude Activision's internal controls from its 2024 financial reporting?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft was indirectly connected to Wells Fargo Bank through its partnership in managing debt obligations, as evidenced by the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture dated November 6, 2023. Wells Fargo Bank was also the Trustee for Activision Blizzard, Inc.'s debt instruments, including its 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 and 2027. In 2024, Microsoft formally held a stake in Activision Blizzard, Inc., but excluded Activision\u2019s internal controls from its financial reporting, citing that Activision\u2019s financial statements represented less than 1% of Microsoft\u2019s total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles) and 2% of total revenues. This suggests that while Microsoft had financial exposure to Activision\u2019s operations and its associated debt obligations managed by Wells Fargo, it maintained a strategic distance in terms of internal control integration, highlighting a shift from a financial partnership in 2023 to a partial operational stake in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel highlighted the increasing importance of energy efficiency in cloud environments, particularly for cloud service providers, noting that optimization for cloud services and applications was a key factor in maintaining competitive differentiation (INTC_10k_2022.pdf). This strategic focus directly informed their 2023 product development roadmap, where they launched the Intel Core Ultra processors\u2014the first client processor family built on Intel 4 technology\u2014featuring a dedicated neural processing unit to drive AI at scale. These processors were designed to deliver leadership PC experiences through co-engineered platform innovation, emphasizing performance optimization and AI capabilities as key differentiators (INTC_10k_2023.pdf). The link between energy efficiency and innovation is reinforced in the broader industry context, where energy efficiency and decarbonization efforts are explicitly tied to the pace of technological development and cost considerations (EMR_10k_2023.pdf).

The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including in serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCG in 2021.\n\nSome cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of a key customer, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from US federal, state, local, and foreign government entities associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, and/or employees, and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.\n\n## Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\n\nA number of factors can increase our effective tax rate, which could reduce our net income, including:\n\n- changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n- the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n- changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n- adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n- increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n- changes in available tax credits;\n- changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;\n- changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the US to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-US income and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;\n- changes in accounting standards; and\n- our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\n\n## We have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\n\nWe are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on factors that include prioritizing cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years.",

      "question": "How did the allocation strategy of TXN's U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan in 2022 compare to 2024 in terms of reliance on Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents, and what does this reveal about the company's risk tolerance for retiree healthcare funding over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TXN's U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan allocated 64% of its assets to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents, reflecting a conservative investment strategy aimed at preserving capital and ensuring stable funding for retiree healthcare obligations. By 2024, this allocation had increased to 80%, indicating a further shift toward lower-risk assets. This evolution in strategy suggests that TXN has become more risk-averse in managing its retiree healthcare liabilities, prioritizing capital preservation and predictable cash flows over growth-oriented investments like equities. The increased reliance on fixed income instruments aligns with a broader trend of de-risking in corporate-sponsored benefit plans, especially for healthcare obligations which are often more sensitive to interest rate environments and require consistent liquidity.",

        "Hop 1: TXN(2022) \u2192 U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan: In 2022, the U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan allocated 64% to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents.",
        "Hop 2: U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan \u2192 Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents: The plan's asset allocation directly depends on these financial instruments as a key component of its investment strategy.",

      "question": "How did changes in technical support services' gross margin risks between 2022 and 2024 affect Cisco's loan receivables credit loss allowances?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco identified technical support services as a risk factor that could negatively impact gross margins due to factors like increased personnel costs and timing of contract renewals. These services are directly tied to loan receivables, as Cisco frequently provides financing arrangements for technical support services alongside product sales. By 2024, Cisco's credit loss allowances for loan receivables decreased from $103 million in 2022 to $53 million in 2023, indicating either improved credit quality of financed customers or more conservative underwriting of technical support service contracts. This suggests that despite margin risks in technical support services, Cisco managed credit exposure in its financing arrangements effectively over this period.",

Service provider product orders decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of  expanding  network  infrastructures;  the  availability  of  funding;  and  the  extent  to  which  service  providers  are  affected  by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result  of  any  slowdown  in  capital  expenditures  by  service  providers  (which  may  be  more  prevalent  during  a  global  economic downturn,  or  periods  of  economic,  political  or  regulatory  uncertainty),  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in  the  past,  many  of  our  service  provider  customers  have  been  materially  and  adversely  affected  by  slowdowns  in  the  general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability,  resulting  in  business  failures  and  substantial  reductions  in  spending  and  expansion  plans.  These  conditions  have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.  Finally,  service  provider  customers  typically  have  longer  implementation  cycles;  require  a  broader  range  of  services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\n\n## Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\n\nIf  we  fail  to  manage  distribution  of  our  products  and  services  properly,  or  if  our  distributors'  financial  condition  or  operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial  portion  of  our  products  and  services  is  sold through  our  channel  partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Our  channel  partners  include  systems  integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network",

      "answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA identified a dependency on foundry partners in Asia, particularly noting that disruptions to these partners\u2014such as those caused by geopolitical tensions or natural disasters\u2014could severely limit or prevent the supply of chipsets, which would materially impact its business. By 2023, NVIDIA specifically called out Taiwan as a key risk, citing that geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan and China could have a material adverse impact on its supply chain continuity. This reflects an evolution where the company\u2019s earlier, more generalized dependency on Asian foundry partners (including those in Taiwan) became a more explicitly identified exposure to Taiwan-specific geopolitical risks, particularly regarding supply constraints and lead times. The shift indicates that NVIDIA\u2019s supply chain risk management focus sharpened on Taiwan\u2019s strategic role in semiconductor manufacturing and its vulnerability to regional instability.",

Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\n\n## Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\n\nOur  worldwide  operations  could  be  disrupted  by  natural  disasters  and  extreme  weather  conditions,  power  or  water shortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or  civil  unrest,  acts  of  war  or  other  military  actions,  epidemics  or  pandemics  and  other  natural  or  man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters  such  as  earthquakes,  wildfires,  or  other  business  disruptions  occurring  in  these  geographical  areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events  beyond  our  control,  can  increase  economic  volatility  globally.  Political  instability,  changes  in  government  or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the invasion by Russia of Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our employees or operations both within and outside these regions, and may result in the loss of some or even all of our assets in those regions. Our operations could be harmed and our costs  could  increase  if  manufacturing,  logistics  or  other  operations  are  disrupted  for  any  reason,  including  natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. For example, our operations could be harmed, and our costs  could  increase,  if  the  conflict  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  results  in  a  shortage  of  key  materials  that  our suppliers,  including  our  foundry  partners,  require  to  satisfy  our  needs.  The  ultimate  impact  on  us,  our  third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a  disaster,  war  or  catastrophic  event  affects  us  or  the  third-party  systems  on  which  we  rely,  our  business  could  be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n\n## We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\n\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of  our  sales  are  made  on  a  purchase  order  basis,  our  customers  can  cancel,  change  or  delay  product  purchase commitments  with  little  or  no  notice  to  us  and  without  penalty.  Our  partners  or  customers  may  develop  their  own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market  share  in  the  markets  for  which  they  purchase  our  products,  all  of  which  may  alter  partners'  or  customers' purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## If  we  are  unable  to  attract,  retain  and  motivate  our  executives  and  key  employees,  our  business  may  be harmed.\n\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry's highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Changes in immigration and  work  permit  regulations  or  in  their  administration  or  interpretation  could  impair  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain qualified  employees.  If  we  are  less  successful  in  our  recruiting  efforts,  or  if  we  cannot  retain  key  employees,  our business may be adversely affected. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated  benefits  of  those  transactions.  We  are  highly  dependent  on  the  services  of  our  longstanding  executive team.  Failure  to  ensure  effective  succession  planning,  transfer  of  knowledge  and  smooth  transitions  involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023, which accounted for less than 1% of Microsoft's total assets as of June 30, 2024 (excluding goodwill and intangible assets), brought Activision's financial instruments\u2014including the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026\u2014onto Microsoft's consolidated balance sheet. In 2024, Microsoft formally introduced these 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 into its debt structure via a fifteenth supplemental indenture dated November 6, 2023, signaling the integration of Activision Blizzard\u2019s liabilities into Microsoft\u2019s broader capital structure. This reflects a strategic evolution in Microsoft\u2019s debt composition post-acquisition.",

      "question": "How did AMD's competitive positioning in discrete GPUs change from 2022 to 2023 in response to Intel's aggressive expansion into the discrete GPU market, and what impact did this have on AMD's segment revenue and strategic focus?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD identified Intel's aggressive expansion into discrete GPUs as a material risk, noting that Intel's introduction of gaming-focused discrete GPUs in 2022 and its dominant market position could lead to lower unit sales and average selling prices for AMD's products. By 2023, AMD had organized its business to include discrete GPUs as a core part of its Gaming segment, indicating a strategic focus on maintaining competitiveness in this area. Despite Intel's increased presence in the discrete GPU market, AMD continued to invest in this segment, suggesting that the company viewed discrete GPUs as critical to its long-term growth and profitability. The segment reporting structure in 2023 highlights the importance of discrete GPUs to AMD's overall revenue strategy, even as it faced intensified competition from Intel.",

        "Hop 1: AMD(2022) \u2192 Intel Corporation: AMD identified Intel's dominance in microprocessors and its aggressive business practices, including the introduction of competitive discrete GPUs, as a material risk to AMD's market position and profitability.",
        "Hop 2: Intel Corporation \u2192 Discrete GPUs: Intel was actively developing and marketing its own high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming-focused products, directly competing with AMD in this market segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Economic and Strategic Risks\n\n## Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.\n\nIntel Corporation (Intel) has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel's market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability.\n\nIntel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and  other  marketing  programs. As  a  result  of  Intel's  position  in  the  microprocessor  market,  Intel  has  been  able  to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets,  graphics  chips,  networking  devices  (wired  and  wireless),  non-volatile  storage  and  other  components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.\n\nAs  long  as  Intel  remains  in  this  dominant  position,  we  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  Intel's  business practices,  including  rebating  and  allocation  strategies  and  pricing  actions,  designed  to  limit  our  market  share  and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments  to  its  current  and  potential  customers,  retailers  and  channel  partners;  de  facto  control  over  industry standards,  and  heavy  influence  on  PC  manufacturers  and  other  PC  industry  participants,  including  motherboard, memory,  chipset  and  basic  input/output  system  (BIOS)  suppliers  and  software  companies  as  well  as  the  graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.\n\nIntel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing  and  research  and  development  than  we  do.  We  expect  Intel  to  continue  to  invest  heavily  in  marketing, research  and  development,  new  manufacturing  facilities  and  other  technology  companies.  To  the  extent  Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel's aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.\n\nIntel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including  giving  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  in  the  graphics  market,  such  as  NVIDIA  Corporation,  preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting access to external companies. Also, Intel has developed their own high-end discrete GPUs and has announced that they have developed gaming-focused discrete  graphics  that  will  be  released  in  2022.  Intel's  position  in  the  microprocessor  market,  its  introduction  of competitive  new  products,  its  existing  relationships  with  top-tier  OEMs,  and  its  aggressive  marketing  and  pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nUncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as  inflation,  interest  rates  or  recession,  may  negatively  impact  consumer  confidence  and  spending  causing  our customers  to  postpone  purchases.  In  addition,  during  challenging  economic  times,  our  current  or  potential  future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally,  if  our  customers  are  not  successful  in  generating  sufficient  revenue  or  are  unable  to  secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to  our  customers  potentially  defaulting  on  or  delaying  payments  to  us  is  increased  because  we  expect  that  a  small number  of  customers  will  continue  to  account  for  a  substantial  part  of  our  revenue. Any  inability  of  our  current  or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.",

By 2024, Microsoft's own debt financing strategy evolved, evidenced by the continued use of Wells Fargo Bank in bond structures\u2014such as the September 19, 2024, indenture for Activision Blizzard\u2019s 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026\u2014indicating a strategic alignment in leveraging Wells Fargo\u2019s trustee services across both legacy and acquired entities.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, the Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations became effective and were expected to increase Microsoft's cash tax payments unless postponed. By fiscal year 2024, Notice 2023-55 delayed the effective date of these regulations to 2024, and Notice 2023-80 later postponed it indefinitely. This delay contributed to a decrease in Microsoft's effective tax rate from 19% in 2023 to 18% in 2024, as the company benefited from tax law changes that reduced immediate cash tax liabilities associated with foreign tax credits. The postponement allowed Microsoft to maintain a more favorable tax position in the short term, avoiding an increase in cash taxes that would have occurred had the regulations taken full effect.",

        "Hop 3: Notice 2023-55 \u2190 MSFT(2024): The delay of the regulations contributed to a lower effective tax rate (18% in 2024 vs. 19% in 2023) and reduced immediate cash tax obligations for Microsoft in fiscal year 2024."

Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first  five  years,  15%  in  year  six,  20%  in  year  seven,  and  25%  in  year  eight.  We  have  paid  transition  tax  of  $6.2  billion,  which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2022. The remaining transition tax of $12.0 billion is payable over the next four years, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nProvisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on July 1, 2022. These provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them on the U.S. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on where research is conducted. The final foreign tax credit regulations, also effective on July 1, 2022, introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit calculations in the U.S. tax return. While these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate on a net basis, our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nDuring fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 95 million shares and 101 million shares of our common stock for $28.0 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2022, $40.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.62 per share. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## PART II\n\nItem 7",

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 83% and 81% of our foreign income before tax. In fiscal year 2022, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71% of our foreign income before tax.

The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from the Greater China region, which explicitly includes Taiwan as part of its geographic segment. By 2024, Apple acknowledged increased dependence on Taiwan due to its role in the supply chain, particularly as a manufacturing hub for critical components. This dependence was highlighted in the 2024 10-K filing, which noted that geopolitical tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, could disrupt operations in Taiwan and significantly impact Apple's global supply chain. The evolution from a regional inclusion in 2022 to an explicit dependency in 2024 underscores a growing strategic risk tied to Taiwan's role in Apple's manufacturing and logistics.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical ev ents, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, T aiwan and V ietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictiv e measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company's business and supply chain in accordance with new or  changed  restrictions  on  international  trade  can  be  expensive,  time-consuming  and  disruptive  to  the  Company's  operations.  Such  restrictions  can  be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty , and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.  For  example,  tensions  between  governments,  including  the  U.S.  and  China,  have  in  the  past  led  to  tariffs  and  other  restrictions  affecting  the Company's business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future,  actions  by  governments  in  response  could  be  significantly  more  severe  and restrictiv e and could materially adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company's and its suppliers' operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company's control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\n\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings, increase the Company's costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\n\nThe Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation. M ajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the  Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company . While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain ty pes of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.",

QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including, but not limited to, 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business, our cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\n## Revenue Concentrations and Significant Customers\n\nA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2022, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies' and 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the use of 5G, the expansion into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in modem, radio-frequency integrated circuit, RFFE, multimedia (camera, video, display and computer vision), sensor perception and drive policy, advanced SoC, which includes specialized engines such as CPU and GPU to enable high performance and low-power computing and other optimization techniques, AI, packaging and a broad range of other technologies. We expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and technologies and to utilize that research and development in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of new modem and multimedia technologies and other technologies (such as ADAS/AD and XR), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world.\n\nWe continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhance existing products and services) for voice and data communications and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as ADAS/AD. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, voice and music devices, wearable devices and XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.\n\nWe develop innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's $X million 2023 strategic investments in XR companies relate to their 2024 claims that 5G technology enables immersive XR experiences, and how does this strategic alignment connect to the increased business risk they reported in 2024 regarding new initiative adoption?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's 2023 10-K filing revealed that the company made strategic investments in XR companies through its Qualcomm Ventures arm, aiming to expand opportunities for its technologies and support the design of new XR products (Hop 1). In 2024, Qualcomm explicitly linked 5G technology to enabling immersive XR experiences, stating that 5G\u2019s low latency and multi-gigabit speeds were foundational for XR applications like AR, VR, and MR (Hop 2). However, Qualcomm also reported in 2024 that extending technologies into new areas like XR posed significant business risks, including the possibility that these initiatives may not generate expected returns or contribute meaningfully to operating income (Hop 3). Therefore, while 5G serves as the technological bridge connecting Qualcomm\u2019s XR investments from 2023 to its product roadmap in 2024, the company acknowledged heightened uncertainty and risk in monetizing these efforts effectively.",

          "chunk_text": "We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products that implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\n- We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n- Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n- A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\n- Our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n- We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\n\n- We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.\n- There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION\n\n- Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n- We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS\n\n- The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.\n- Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n- Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.",

      "question": "How did the change in TXN's Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan allocation toward Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents from 79% in 2022 to a potential 100% range in 2023 reflect a shift in their pension fund risk management strategy, and what financial implications might this have on their long-term liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TXN reported that 79% of the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan was allocated to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents, indicating a relatively conservative investment posture aimed at preserving capital and meeting near-term obligations. By 2023, the disclosed range for this allocation widened significantly to 60%-100%, allowing for the possibility of full allocation to fixed income and cash equivalents. This evolution in investment strategy suggests a more cautious approach to pension fund risk management, potentially in response to global economic uncertainty or a strategic decision to prioritize liability matching and liquidity. The increased emphasis on fixed income could reduce the volatility of plan returns and improve the predictability of pension expenses, although it may also limit long-term growth potential. This shift would likely influence how TXN manages its long-term pension liabilities and could affect future funding contributions and financial reporting obligations.",

      "answer": "Apple's 2022 financial data shows that the Greater China region, which includes Taiwan, accounted for $74.2B in net sales. In the 2023 filing, Apple explicitly disclosed that its supply chain operations are significantly exposed to risks in Taiwan, where manufacturing partners operate. The 2023 filing emphasizes that geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan could disrupt Apple's supply chain, increase costs, and affect product availability. This indicates that Apple's substantial revenue from Greater China in 2022, which includes sales tied to operations in Taiwan, directly correlates with its increased focus on supply chain risks in that region in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Samsung was one of Qualcomm's two largest customers, each contributing 10% or more of consolidated revenues, highlighting Qualcomm's significant dependency on major OEMs like Samsung for its semiconductor business. However, Samsung's development of its own integrated circuit products posed a risk to Qualcomm's semiconductor revenue stream, as Samsung could increasingly use its own chips in its devices rather than Qualcomm's. By 2024, Qualcomm had responded by deepening its own commitments to integrated circuit production, with $12.8 billion in total purchase obligations for integrated circuit inventory, including $3.0 billion in advance payments tied to multi-year capacity purchase commitments. This suggests that in response to the risk of Samsung's vertical integration, Qualcomm reinforced its control over manufacturing capacity and supply chain stability to maintain competitiveness and secure its position in the market despite Samsung's evolving role.",

QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including, but not limited to, 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business, our cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\n## Revenue Concentrations and Significant Customers\n\nA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2022, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies' and 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was nine years and eight years, respectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $184 million, $204 million and $207 million, respectively.

If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.

Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.

In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest i n our first fiscal quarter. See 'Cloud and License Business' in Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of the revenues, expenses and margins of our cloud and license business, which is our largest business.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.\n\nOur customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments. Our enterprise cloud, license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Adobe Systems Incorporated, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Intel Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Salesforce, Inc. and SAP SE, as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. For example, following our acquisition of Cerner Corporation (Cerner), we also face competition from large healthcare IT providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Arcadia Solutions, athenahealth, Inc., Epic Systems Corporation and InterSystems Corporation, among others. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions-including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lines-which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories.\n\nKey competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our products and services sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors:",

      "question": "How did Broadcom's (AVGO) focus on AIOps within its Distributed Software portfolio evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the strategic positioning of AIOps in their broader software offerings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Broadcom's Distributed Software portfolio included AIOps as one of several offerings, listed alongside ValueOps and DevOps, indicating a balanced approach to software delivery optimization. By 2023, AIOps remained a key component of the Distributed Software portfolio, but it was also more prominently integrated into the Mainframe Software portfolio, which now explicitly included AIOps under its major offerings alongside Operational Analytics & Management, Workload Automation, and Database & Data Management. This evolution suggests that Broadcom elevated AIOps from a general-purpose offering within Distributed Software to a more strategic, cross-portfolio capability that supports both distributed and mainframe environments. The increased prominence of AIOps in 2023 reflects Broadcom\u2019s broader strategy to enhance automation and intelligence across its software solutions, aligning with market trends toward AI-driven operations and infrastructure optimization.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Microsoft acknowledged exposure to the OECD's Global Minimum Tax under the Pillar Two Model Rules, noting uncertainty about final rules and global adoption but expecting minimal impact due to limited operations in jurisdictions below the 15% minimum tax threshold. By fiscal year 2024, Microsoft confirmed that Pillar Two legislation was being implemented across many countries and would apply to the company starting in fiscal year 2025. Despite this, Microsoft still projected no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. This stability in expected tax cost impact contrasts with a shift in the effective tax rate from 19% in 2023 to 18% in 2024, partly due to tax law changes and the geographic distribution of income, with foreign earnings taxed at lower rates continuing to influence the overall tax burden.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## Effective Tax Rate\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectiv ely. The decrease in our effectiv e tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effectiv e date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effectiv e tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effectiv e tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and serv ices. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Dev elopment ('OECD') published its model rules 'Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries hav e implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD prov ides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we receiv ed Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believ e our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will v igorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrativ e appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently av ailable, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee sev erance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activ ities. We believ e these non-GAAP measures aid inv estors by prov iding additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in ev aluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",

      "question": "How might the increased long-term rate of return assumption for TXN's U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan in 2024 relate to the fixed income allocation strategy observed in 2022, particularly given the plan's reliance on fixed income securities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TXN allocated 64% of the U.S. Retiree Health Care Plan to fixed income securities and cash equivalents, indicating a conservative investment strategy aimed at preserving capital. By 2024, the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for this same entity increased from 5.70% to 6.00%. This suggests that despite maintaining a significant fixed income allocation, the plan may have adjusted its expectations for returns\u2014potentially due to a shift in market conditions or a recalibration of risk tolerance. The increased return assumption could reflect a strategic effort to improve the plan\u2019s funded status or reduce future contributions, even while retaining a relatively stable asset mix. These changes may influence the net periodic benefit cost and overall liability management for TXN.",

By 2024, Apple continued to disclose that its Notes remained structured as Senior Unsecured Obligations with interest payable in arrears. However, the absence of detailed interest rate ranges or amounts in 2024 suggests a potential shift in disclosure strategy or a more streamlined issuance approach.

By 2023, this allocation increased to a range of 75%\u201385%, showing a further shift toward more stable, fixed-income instruments.

      "answer": "In 2022, QCOM identified Samsung as a major customer that was already developing its own integrated circuit products, which it used in some of its devices instead of QCOM\u2019s offerings. By 2024, this trend had evolved, with Samsung explicitly named as both a competitor and a customer, indicating a deepening dual relationship that increased competitive pressure and reduced QCOM's market share in premium-tier devices. This shift likely contributed to a higher risk profile for QCOM's semiconductor business, as Samsung's vertical integration efforts threatened QCOM's revenue and margin stability, especially in high-margin product segments. The increased risk is further compounded by Samsung\u2019s potential to sell its own chips to third parties, directly competing with QCOM and reducing its licensing leverage in the broader ecosystem.",

Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

          "chunk_text": "mobile handsets, automotive or IoT, among others. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our businesses or product lines. Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Mobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors' integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless networks, which may enable such competitors to better optimize their integrated circuit products for performance on those networks; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions.\n\nIn addition, certain of our largest customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers, such as Apple and Samsung, have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize or may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers; limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us; or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows, and/or enabling critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development, and commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nCompetition in any or all product areas or device tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees' products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n\n## Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are ex acerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices, including motor vehicles or motor vehicle systems. We routinely monitor for and assess security vulnerabilities in our products and offer remediation measures if appropriate. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or provide remediation measures for vulnerabilities (or our customers may fail to implement remediation measures) before they are exploited.\n\nOur products may be used in devices that interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content, which creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers' products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers' products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers' businesses or the",

      "question": "How did Intel's 2023 OEM partnerships, which emphasized deployment of Xeon processors and heterogeneous compute solutions, contribute to the increased compulsory licensing pressures Intel faced in 2024, particularly in light of OEM strategies documented by Qualcomm and Intel's own 2024 disclosures around IP risk?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Intel expanded its OEM partnerships to deploy 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and heterogeneous compute solutions, including FPGAs and GPUs, across data centers and enterprise environments. This increased OEM reliance on Intel\u2019s IP in their systems. By 2024, OEM strategies\u2014documented in Qualcomm\u2019s 10-K\u2014showed efforts to avoid paying fair royalties through litigation, regulatory lobbying, and compulsory licensing proposals. These same strategies, when applied to Intel\u2019s IP, contributed to the compulsory licensing pressures Intel acknowledged in its 2024 10-K, where it stated that governments or courts may require compulsory licensing of its IP rights. This evolution highlights how Intel's earlier OEM-driven IP deployment created downstream exposure to broader industry IP risk trends.",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data-protection measures are significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions.\n\n## We are subject to IP risks, including related litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nWe cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law-as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others -to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in v arious countries and other geopolitical factors. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations and governments or courts render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability  to enforce our IP rights under any  of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&amp;D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.\n\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally  license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\n\nThird parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, investment litigation entities, other non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by third-party investment firms. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or relationship with customers, and disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non-competitors. For example, in February 2024, R2 Semiconductor, Inc., a non-practicing entity, was able to obtain an injunction and recall order against us and our customers in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany that, if enforced, could have caused significant potential disruption to our and our customers' businesses in Europe. In the past few years, we have faced costly and lengthy lawsuits across multiple jurisdictions selected by non-practicing entities with well-funded third-party investment support, including most notably the V LSI and R2 litigation, which have resulted in significant adverse judgments and settlements.\n\nWe are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. A ny such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, in many instances, we agree to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n\n- pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, penalties, or provide accommodations to customers such as through cash payments or discounts;\n- stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n- need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n- enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.\n\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.\n\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our existing licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation\n\n40",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel included FPGAs as part of its core product offerings under its programmable semiconductors segment. By 2023, Intel reorganized Altera \u2014 the division responsible for FPGAs \u2014 as a standalone business and began pursuing monetization opportunities, including a potential IPO. By 2024, Intel was actively working to separate Altera as an autonomous subsidiary, aligning with its broader 'Smart Capital' strategy to unlock value and reduce internal complexity. This shift contributed to a $6.6 billion decrease in cost of sales from 2022 to 2023 due to lower intersegment costs and factory start-up expenses. However, Intel also recognized a $755 million charge in 2024 related to construction delays tied to its foundry expansion, indicating continued capital risk as it refocused on core manufacturing and product capabilities while offloading non-core assets like Altera.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed.\n\nOur implementation of new business strategies, including our foundry strategy and our cost reduction measures, as well as our many internal structural, systems, and process changes, may subject us to a number of risks. We have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitaliz e on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand, ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, A I, and sensing. As part of our strategy, we announced plans to establish Intel Foundry as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product-based business units. The implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural, system, and process changes to support the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business, including a new enterprise resource planning system. In parallel, we are undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business, such as operating Intel Foundry, A ltera and IM S, as autonomous subsidiaries that we majority own and consolidate in order to potentially raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities. Significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NA ND memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition in not just new and evolving markets but also in our existing markets. These new sources of competition can include established competitors with well-developed and highly competitive technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, A I and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to dev elop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. We may also not be successful in developing a competitive foundry business for external customers with respect to either leading-edge or mature process nodes, which would make it difficult for us to realize a favorable return on our investments in process technology and manufacturing capacity investments. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.\n\n## Our Smart Capital approach to capital spending, alternative financing arrangements, and pursuit of government grants involves risks and may not be successful.\n\nAs we pursue our strategy, we have utilized our Smart Capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and scale our capital investments. To support our capital investments, we have pursued alternative financing arrangements, such as our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our Arizona campus, and our 2024 joint investment with A pollo related to Fab 34 in Ireland, and may enter into similar arrangements in the future. These transactions may fail to advance our business strategy, may include unfavorable pricing or other terms such as penalties should key metrics not be attained as prescribed by our agreements, and may fail to achieve their anticipated benefits. Both arrangements include commitments we may not be able to satisfy, including commitments relating to construction and/or wafer demand or purchase, in which case we may be required to make additional payments to our partners. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a $755 million charge related to penalties we expect to pay in connection with Ireland SCIP for construction delays we decided to make as we reduced our near-term capacity requirements. Further, both arrangements are expected to significantly and increasingly impact our net income (loss) attributable to Intel and earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel in future periods as wafer production volumes increase at our expanded Arizona campus and at Fab 34 in Ireland. Our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to resolv e any  potential disputes. A ny  of these risks, including our ability  to effectuate any  additional transactions at all, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital for our required investments.\n\nIn addition, as part of our Smart Capital approach, we have applied for, received, and expect to receive additional grants and incentives from domestic and foreign local, regional, and national governments. Legislation in the US and EU has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions. However, any amounts, if any, we may receive under any agreements enabled by such legislation may not be sufficient in amount or timeliness to support our capital investment plans and offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as compared to those of many of our competitors, we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of any such grants and incentives, or such agreements may contain restrictions that limit our flex ibility  to pursue changes in business strategy  or transactions that may enhance stockholder value. For example, in November 2024 we entered into a direct funding agreement with the US Department of Commerce under the CHIPS Act that contains detailed milestones we must achieve for us to receive the funds, including with respect to achievement of various milestones with respect to capital expenditures, facility completion, process technology development, wafer production, Intel products insourcing, and external foundry customer acquisitions. It also contains restrictions on certain 'change of control' transactions we are permitted to engage in, a requirement that we share with the US government project returns above specified thresholds, and various termination rights and remedies if we were to breach the agreement, including potential repayment of some or all of the awards. To the extent funding is below our expectations, we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements, we are required to return any amounts received from any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations contained therein, we are subject to restrictions as a result of any awards we have accepted, or the US government delays or does not provide any awards",

      "question": "How did Apple's operational dependence on China Mainland in 2022 relate to the increased proportion of iPhone revenue in the Greater China segment in 2023?",
      "answer": "Apple's 2022 filing highlighted a strong operational dependence on China Mainland due to manufacturing and supply chain activities, with risks such as tariffs and public health disruptions potentially impacting gross margins and product costs. China Mainland is a key component of the Greater China segment, which also includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 2023, Apple reported that iPhone revenue represented a 'moderately higher proportion' of net sales specifically in the Greater China region. This suggests that despite the risks identified in 2022, Apple's reliance on China Mainland for production may have supported increased iPhone sales in the broader Greater China market during 2023, contributing to a shift in revenue mix within that region.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.

      "answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA identified significant inventory risks stemming from increased demand for competitive products, which could lead to excess inventory and reduced gross margins if demand for NVIDIA\u2019s offerings declined or was captured by competitors. This risk was compounded by supply chain constraints and long-term commitments that made demand forecasting difficult. By 2024, NVIDIA strategically deepened partnerships with technology companies across AI and accelerated computing, including collaborations in data centers, automotive platforms, and generative AI applications. These partnerships\u2014evidenced by NVIDIA's work with industry leaders to transform infrastructure and its support for over 4,400 applications\u2014helped stabilize demand forecasting by aligning more closely with market needs and reducing reliance on speculative inventory. The shift demonstrates a strategic evolution from mitigating competitive risk through supply chain control to leveraging ecosystem collaboration for sustained growth.",

We  may  also  face  supply  constraints  caused  by  natural  disasters  or  other  events.  If  we  are  able  to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.\n\nIn periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we  are  in  today,  we  have  placed  and  may  continue  to  place  non-cancellable  inventory  orders  in  advance  of  our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six months' lead time, we have begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters  and  long-term  supply  and  capacity  needs.  However,  we  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict  when  such periods of shortage will end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if  there  is  a  partial  or  complete  reduction  in  long-term  demand  for  our  products  or  if  such  demand  is  served  by  our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.\n\nWe  depend  on  third  parties  and  their  technology  to  manufacture,  assemble,  test,  package  or  design  our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.\n\nWe do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on  third-party  software  development  tools  to  assist  us  in  the  design,  simulation  and  verification  of  new  products  or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\n\n- lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n- failure  by  our  foundries  or  contract  manufacturers  to  procure  raw  materials  or  to  provide  adequate  levels  of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;",

When we do partner with fintechs and technology companies, we face a heightened risk when those relationships involve sharing Mastercard data. While we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data standards, without proper oversight we could give the partner a competitive advantage.\n- Competitors, customers, fintechs, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete  with  or  replace  value-added  products  and  services  we  currently  provide  to  support  our  switched  transaction  and payment offerings. These products could replace our own switching and payments offerings or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these offerings. In addition, governments that develop or encourage the creation of national payments platforms may promote their platforms in such a way that could put us at a competitive disadvantage in those markets, or require us to compete differently.\n- Participants in the payments industry may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment products and services that compete with our products and services.\n\nOur failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nIn order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our Mastercard-branded cards and enabled products and services, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support that promote our products. In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts. We continue to experience pricing pressure. The demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates  and  incentives  moderates  our  growth.  We  may  not  be  able  to  continue  our  expansion  strategy  to  switch  additional transaction  volumes  or  to  provide  additional  services  to  our  customers  at  levels  sufficient  to  compensate  for  such  lower  fees  or increased costs in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. In addition, increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives.\n\nIn the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers. In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further  increase  transaction  volumes  or  the  amount  of  services  provided  thereunder  in  order  to  benefit  incrementally  from  such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth.\n\nThe payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways:\n\n- Technological changes, including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and block chain technology, machine learning and AI, could result in new technologies  that  may  be  superior  to,  or  render  obsolete,  the  technologies  we  currently  use  in  our  programs  and  services. Moreover, these changes could result in new and innovative payment methods and products that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our products.\n- We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. The inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments, or the acquisition of these companies by competitors, could negatively impact our offerings.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's reliance on Samsung as a top customer in 2022 influence its 2023 financial commitments to integrated circuit suppliers, given Samsung's in-house development of competing products?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm disclosed that Samsung was one of only two customers (alongside Apple) that contributed more than 10% of its consolidated revenues, highlighting a significant dependency on Samsung for revenue. However, the 2022 filing also warned that Samsung was developing its own integrated circuit products, which could reduce Qualcomm\u2019s semiconductor sales and margins. By 2023, Qualcomm had entered into substantial multi-year capacity purchase commitments with suppliers of its integrated circuit products, totaling $12.8 billion in inventory obligations, $9.6 billion of which was expected to be paid within the next 12 months. This suggests Qualcomm responded to the risk of Samsung's vertical integration by locking in supply chain capacity to protect its semiconductor business and maintain competitive positioning despite Samsung's internal development efforts.",

QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including, but not limited to, 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business, our cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\n## Revenue Concentrations and Significant Customers\n\nA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2022, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies' and 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the use of 5G, the expansion into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in modem, radio-frequency integrated circuit, RFFE, multimedia (camera, video, display and computer vision), sensor perception and drive policy, advanced SoC, which includes specialized engines such as CPU and GPU to enable high performance and low-power computing and other optimization techniques, AI, packaging and a broad range of other technologies. We expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and technologies and to utilize that research and development in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of new modem and multimedia technologies and other technologies (such as ADAS/AD and XR), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world.\n\nWe continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhance existing products and services) for voice and data communications and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as ADAS/AD. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, voice and music devices, wearable devices and XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.\n\nWe develop innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') is intended to help  the  reader  understand  the  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  of  Microsoft  Corporation.  MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. For a discussion of the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, please refer to Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency.

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD outsourced portions of its product distribution and transportation management to third-party providers, which introduced risks related to operational inefficiencies and lack of control over distribution channels. This reliance contributed to gray market sales, where products were diverted from authorized channels and sold at heavy discounts, creating shadow inventory that AMD could not track. By 2023, this lack of visibility and control over gray market sales made it increasingly difficult for AMD to forecast demand accurately, as the company could not reliably predict how many genuine products were in circulation or how gray market activity would distort legitimate demand patterns. The continued presence of gray market products also competed with AMD\u2019s authorized channels, negatively impacting margins and customer satisfaction.",

          "chunk_text": "## We  outsource  to  third  parties  certain  supply-chain  logistics  functions,  including  portions  of  our  product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.\n\nWe rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop  application  services,  business  and  software  support  applications,  server  and  storage  administration,  data center  operations,  database  administration  and  voice,  video  and  remote  access.  We  cannot  guarantee  that  these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case  our  internal  operations  and  the  distribution  of  our  products  to  our  customers  could  be  materially  adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.\n\n## Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the 'gray market.' Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray  market  products,  which  adversely  affects  demand  for  our  products  and  negatively  impacts  our  margins.  In addition,  our  inability  to  control  gray  market  activities  could  result  in  customer  satisfaction  issues  because  any  time products  are  purchased  outside  our  authorized  distribution  channels  there  is  a  risk  that  our  customers  are  buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Government actions and regulations such as export administration regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.\n\nWe have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. In October 2019, the BIS added additional Chinese entities to the Entity List. Also, the United States administration has called for changes  to domestic and foreign policy. Specifically, United States-China trade relations  remain uncertain. The United States administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin, and China has imposed tariffs in response to the actions of the United States. We are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and AMD processor-based products. There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our customers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect  on  our  business. A  significant  trade  disruption  or  the  establishment  or  increase  of  any  tariffs,  trade  protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business.\n\n## If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income  and  reduce  income  taxes  payable  in  future  periods.  Each  quarter,  we  consider  both  positive  and  negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "question": "How did Broadcom's allocation strategy to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities within its fixed income portfolio change from fiscal year 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the evolution of its liability-driven investment approach?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's U.S. qualified pension plan allocated a portion of its fixed income investments to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) as part of a broader strategy that included long-term core bonds and high-yield bonds. By fiscal year 2023, the plan maintained 100% allocation to fixed income, but the emphasis appeared to shift toward long-term core bond investments, with TIPS remaining a smaller component. This indicates that while the liability-driven investment strategy remained focused on minimizing market and interest rate risks, there was a relative de-emphasis on inflation protection in favor of duration matching to align more closely with forecasted liabilities.",

Our benefit plan investment committee has set the investment strategy to fully match the liability. We direct the overall portfolio allocation and use a third-party investment consultant that has the discretion to structure portfolios and select the investment managers within those allocation parameters. Multiple investment managers are utilized, including both active and passive management approaches. The plan assets are invested using the liability-driven investment strategy intended to minimize market and interest rate risks, and those assets are periodically rebalanced toward asset allocation targets.\n\nThe target asset allocation for the U.S. qualified pension plan reflects a risk/return profile that we believe is appropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation of plan assets relative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. For both fiscal years 2022 and 2021, 100% of the U.S. qualified pension plan assets were allocated to fixed income, in line with the target allocation. The fixed income allocation is primarily directed toward longterm core bond investments, with smaller allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and high-yield bonds.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ACN disclosed that the majority of their contracts were terminable by clients with little or no penalties, and only non-cancelable portions were included in performance obligations. This lack of binding enforceability likely contributed to the competitive pressures and client retention risks outlined in 2024, where ACN noted that competitors were offering more aggressive pricing and contractual terms, increasing the risk of losing clients and market share. The 2024 report also highlighted that contract terminations or non-renewals could lead to significant revenue loss and difficulty in quickly replacing that revenue, reinforcing the vulnerability introduced by the 2023 contract structure.",

          "chunk_text": "- accounting firms and consultancies that provide consulting, managed services and other IT services and solutions;\n- solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including advertising agency holding companies, engineering services providers and technology start-ups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain markets and provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and\n- in-house IT departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm, such as the growing number of companies that are setting up global capability centers ('GCC's').\n\nSome competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals, may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do. Our competitors may also team together to create competing offerings.\n\nEven if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients. Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these markets more challenging. Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive pricing or contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the markets we currently serve. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers, acquisitions or teaming arrangements. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours. New services or technologies offered by competitors, ecosystem partners or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternativ es, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The technology companies described above, including many of our ecosystem partners, are increasingly able to offer services related to their software, platform, cloud migration and other solutions, or are developing software, platform, cloud migration and other solutions that require integration services to a lesser extent or replace them in their entirety. These more integrated services and solutions may represent more attractive alternatives to clients than some of our services and solutions, which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.\n\n## Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.\n\nWe believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients or competitors, cybersecurity incidents or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery or solution failures, compliance violations, government investigations or legal proceedings. We may also experience reputational damage from employees, advocacy groups, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer, the clients or markets that we serve, or the ways in which we operate our business. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, ecosystem partners, joint v enture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers and advocacy groups.\n\nThere is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about A ccenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, ex pensiv e and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements or could negatively impact our relationships with ecosystem partners, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the A ccenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\n\nOur brand and reputation are also associated with our public commitments to various corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. Our disclosures on these matters and any failure or perceived failure to achieve or accurately report on our commitments, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our client relationships or our recruitment and retention efforts, as well as expose us to potential legal liability. In addition, positions we take or do not take on these issues may be unpopular with some of our employees, our clients or potential clients, our investors, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the media, or advocacy groups, which may impact our ability to attract or retain employees or the demand for our services. We also may choose not to conduct business with potential clients or discontinue or not expand business with existing clients due to these positions.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn in 2022, which was highlighted by a 34% revenue growth for LinkedIn that year, laid the foundation for a more aggressive monetization strategy in 2023. By 2023, LinkedIn's Premium Subscriptions were explicitly positioned as a key monetized solution with AI-enabled features such as enhanced search and professional development tools. The integration allowed Microsoft to leverage LinkedIn's growing user base and engagement metrics to introduce advanced, AI-driven capabilities within Premium Subscriptions, directly tying member growth and platform engagement to increased monetization opportunities. This evolution in strategy reflects Microsoft's intent to transform LinkedIn from a high-growth platform into a more robust revenue driver through targeted, value-added services.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') is intended to help  the  reader  understand  the  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  of  Microsoft  Corporation.  MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. For a discussion of the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, please refer to Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.\n\nWe  generate  revenue  by  offering  a  wide  range  of  cloud-based  and  other  services  to  people  and  businesses;  licensing  and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.\n\nHighlights from fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 included:\n\n- Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue increased 32% to $91.2 billion.\n- Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 18%.\n- Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 59.7 million.\n- LinkedIn revenue increased 34%.\n- Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 39%.\n- Server products and cloud services revenue increased 28% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 45%.\n- Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing ('Windows OEM') revenue increased 11%.\n- Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11%.\n- Xbox content and services revenue increased 3%.\n- Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 27%.\n- Surface revenue increased 3%.\n\nOn March 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. ('Nuance') for a total purchase price of $18.8 billion,  consisting  primarily  of  cash.  Nuance  is  a  cloud  and  artificial  intelligence  ('AI')  software  provider  with  healthcare  and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 - Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

      "answer": "In 2022, TXN allocated 70% of its U.S. Defined Benefit Plan assets to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents, which remained consistent with the prior year (2021), indicating a stable short-term strategy. These assets are linked to the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan as part of the pension fund's overall allocation framework. By 2023, this allocation decreased to 65%, with a corresponding increase in equity securities from 30% to 35%. This shift suggests a potential recalibration in TXN's pension fund asset strategy, possibly reflecting a modest increase in risk tolerance or a response to interest rate dynamics that may have affected fixed income yields. The change required analysis of both years\u2019 disclosures and the relationship between asset classes and the plan structure to interpret the strategic intent.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Qualcomm made strategic investments in XR through its Qualcomm Ventures arm, aiming to expand opportunities for its technologies and support new product development in areas like 5G-enabled immersive experiences. These investments were closely tied to 5G technology, as XR applications\u2014such as augmented reality and virtual reality\u2014require the low latency and high data rates enabled by 5G networks. The company emphasized that 5G was foundational for next-generation XR experiences, including cloud gaming and ultra-high-definition video streaming. However, by 2024, Qualcomm faced increased risks tied to its reliance on 5G monetization strategies. The 2024 risk factors highlighted challenges in renewing or renegotiating license agreements, OEM resistance to paying fair royalties, and potential legal or regulatory actions that could disrupt its licensing model. These risks were amplified by the company's strategic push into XR, which deepened its dependency on 5G adoption and licensing success, exposing it to greater volatility in revenue and legal exposure.",

These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\n- We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n- Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n- A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\n- Our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n- We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\n\n- We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.\n- There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION\n\n- Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n- We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS\n\n- The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.\n- Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n- Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's increased reliance on integrated circuit product commitments in 2023 relate to Samsung's vertical integration strategy and its competitive impact on Qualcomm's business in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Qualcomm had $12.8 billion in integrated circuit product inventory obligations, reflecting a strong reliance on these products. This dependence was closely tied to relationships with customers like Samsung, who also develops their own integrated circuit products. By 2024, Samsung's vertical integration efforts intensified, with the company increasingly utilizing its own chips in devices rather than Qualcomm's, directly contributing to Qualcomm identifying Samsung as a growing competitor. This shift likely undermined Qualcomm's revenue and margin potential, as Samsung's self-reliance reduced demand for Qualcomm's core products and intensified competitive pressures in the semiconductor market.",

        "Hop 3: Samsung \u2190 QCOM(2024): Samsung is now identified as a direct competitor due to its vertical integration, which negatively impacts Qualcomm's business through reduced sales and increased competition."

Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

          "chunk_text": "mobile handsets, automotive or IoT, among others. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our businesses or product lines. Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Mobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors' integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless networks, which may enable such competitors to better optimize their integrated circuit products for performance on those networks; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions.\n\nIn addition, certain of our largest customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors' integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers, such as Apple and Samsung, have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize or may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers; limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us; or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows, and/or enabling critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development, and commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nCompetition in any or all product areas or device tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees' products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n\n## Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are ex acerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices, including motor vehicles or motor vehicle systems. We routinely monitor for and assess security vulnerabilities in our products and offer remediation measures if appropriate. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or provide remediation measures for vulnerabilities (or our customers may fail to implement remediation measures) before they are exploited.\n\nOur products may be used in devices that interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content, which creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers' products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers' products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers' businesses or the",

      "question": "How did Broadcom's (AVGO) allocation strategy toward Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities within its fixed income portfolio evolve from fiscal year 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about its liability-driven investment approach?",
      "answer": "In both fiscal years 2023 and 2024, Broadcom maintained a 100% fixed income allocation for its U.S. qualified pension plan, consistent with its liability-driven investment strategy aimed at minimizing market and interest rate risks. Within that fixed income allocation, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) were included as a smaller component alongside long-term core bonds and high-yield bonds. The consistent inclusion of TIPS in both years suggests a stable tactical approach to inflation hedging within the broader fixed income framework, indicating that Broadcom did not materially alter its risk/return profile or inflation protection stance year-over-year.",

        "Hop 2: Fixed Income \u2192 Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities: The fixed income portfolio included smaller allocations to TIPS and high-yield bonds.",
        "Hop 3: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities \u2190 AVGO(2024): In 2024, AVGO maintained the same 100% fixed income allocation, with TIPS continuing to be a component of the portfolio."

The plan assets are invested using the liability-driven i nvestment strategy intended to minimize market and interest rate risks, and those assets are periodically rebalanced toward asset allocation targets.\n\nThe target asset allocation for the U.S. qualified pension plan reflects a risk/return profile that we believe is appropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation of plan assets relative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. For both fiscal years 2024 and 2023, 100% of the U.S. qualified pension plan assets were allocated to fi xed income, in line with the target allocation.

      "answer": "In 2023, AVGO valued developed technology related to VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) using the multi-period excess earnings method, assigning $24,156 million to this category as part of the VMware acquisition. This approach factored in projected revenues, technology obsolescence rates, and discount rates specific to VCF. By 2024, AVGO shifted its developed technology valuation methodology from the multi-period excess earnings method to the relief-from-royalty method, applying the latter to SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. This change in methodology reflects a broader strategic pivot in how AVGO reports intangible assets, moving toward a royalty-based income approach that aligns with different product lines and cash flow expectations. The shift suggests a recalibration of asset valuation practices in response to evolving business focus and forecasting models.",

          "chunk_text": "\nCustomer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. Customer contracts and related relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the customer contracts and related relationships less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on the useful lives of other intangible assets and the length of time remaining on the acquired contracts.\n\nDeveloped technology relates to SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. We valued the developed technology using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the developed technology. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period.\n\nThe fair value of IPR&amp;D was determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue from the IPR&amp;D.\n\n## 5. Supplemental Financial Information\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents included $1,716 million and $1,470 million of time deposits and $1,171 million and $1,650 million of money-market funds as of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. For time deposits, carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of money-market funds, which was consistent with their carrying value, was determined using unadjusted prices in active, accessible markets for i dentical assets, and as such, they were classified as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Accounts Receivable Factoring\n\nWe sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring arrangements. We account for these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring arrangements were $5,900 million, $3,975 million and $3,700 million during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in other income (expense), net and were not material for any of the periods presented.\n\n## Inventory\n\n",

      "answer": "The increase in Cisco's loan receivables from $4.66B in FY2022 to an implied higher amount in FY2023 (based on the continued role of loan receivables in financing multi-year service contracts including Advanced Services) indicates growing adoption and financing of these services. According to the 2023 filing, loan receivables are used to finance the sale of hardware, software, and services\u2014including Advanced Services\u2014with terms averaging one to three years.

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system.

      "answer": "Microsoft's Enterprise and Partner Services revenue declined marginally from $7,900 million in 2023 to $7,594 million in 2024, even as the company maintained a clear strategic focus on Enterprise Support Services as part of its broader customer deployment and management offerings. In 2024, Microsoft explicitly described Enterprise Support Services as a key enabler for customers developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server solutions, desktop solutions, and Nuance AI tools. Despite the modest revenue contraction, the company continued to invest in these services as part of a larger ecosystem that includes Industry Solutions, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience. This suggests a strategic prioritization of long-term customer enablement and ecosystem development over short-term revenue growth in this segment.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's continued use of BNY Mellon as trustee in its 2024 debt indentures reflect the evolution of its relationship with the institution compared to 2023, particularly in light of the shift to U.S. Bank National Association for certain notes?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft continued to reference The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as trustee in its filings for existing indentures, including the 0.875% Notes due 2013. In 2024, while BNY Mellon remained a key trustee in earlier indentures, newer supplemental indentures\u2014such as those dated February 12, 2015, and November 3, 2015\u2014listed U.S. Bank National Association as trustee instead. This indicates a strategic diversification or transition in Microsoft\u2019s trustee relationships over time, with BNY Mellon maintaining a legacy role while U.S. Bank assumed responsibility for newer debt instruments. The 2024 filings show that Microsoft maintained a durable relationship with BNY Mellon for older notes while evolving its financial structuring practices by engaging new trustees for subsequent issuances.",

        "Hop 1: MSFT(2023) \u2192 0.875% Notes due 2013: Microsoft referenced BNY Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as trustee in the filings for these older notes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft completed the acquisition of LinkedIn, which had already been offering Talent Solutions as a core monetized service, contributing to LinkedIn's 34% revenue growth that year. By 2023, Microsoft had deepened the integration of LinkedIn's offerings, explicitly highlighting AI-enabled features within Talent Solutions to help companies with workforce planning, hiring, and closing skills gaps. This strategic evolution suggests that the acquisition provided Microsoft with the infrastructure and data to enhance Talent Solutions with AI capabilities, aligning with broader trends in intelligent business applications across Microsoft's portfolio.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') is intended to help  the  reader  understand  the  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  of  Microsoft  Corporation.  MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021.

We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency.

Nuance  is  a  cloud  and  artificial  intelligence  ('AI')  software  provider  with  healthcare  and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 - Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models.

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD introduced Versal\u2122 FPGAs as part of its adaptive computing product portfolio, positioning them for high-performance applications in data centers and AI environments. By 2024, these FPGAs were explicitly named in U.S. export control regulations under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), specifically ECCN 4A090, which restricted their export to China and other D5 countries without a license. The introduction of these advanced FPGAs increased AMD's regulatory exposure, as the company was now subject to BIS requirements including the Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification process for shipments to these regions. This regulatory burden limited AMD\u2019s ability to forecast and execute international shipments, particularly in markets like China, where export controls were tightened in response to national security concerns around AI and high-performance computing technologies.",

These controls prev ent us from shipping certain AMD Instinct\u2122 integrated circuits and certain AMD Versal\u2122 FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China), without a license. These controls also require us to file a  Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification with BIS 25 days before shipping certain Versal FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China). The NAC notification process could result in BIS prohibiting a shipment or requiring  a  license  application  before  shipping  a  product  that  is  the  subject  of  a  NAC  notification.  BIS  may  issue  new  licensing  requirements  and regulatory controls in the future. Ev en new products that fall below the licensing thresholds may not be successful because we hav e no assurances BIS will agree that the alternativ e products are not subject to the new licensing requirements or that future regulations will not control the alternativ e products. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result  in  lost  sales  adv ersely  impacting  our  reputation  and  business.

New export control restrictions may adv ersely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all.

The United States and its allies continue to focus on export restrictions targeting semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products and serv ices. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and in the future is likely to further adopt other unilateral or multilateral controls. The scope and application of such controls hav e been and may again be v ery broad, which may prohibit us from exporting or prov iding access to our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negativ ely impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to meet demand abroad. If these export controls targeting semiconductors associated with AI including GPUs and associated products and serv ices are further tightened, our ability to export our technology, products or serv ices could be further restricted. We may be at a competitiv e disadv antage if our competitors are not subject to the same or similar restrictions. Additionally, such export controls hav e, and may in the future, subject downstream recipients of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair or transfer of our products and may hav e a material adv erse effect on us.\n\nWe may, from time to time, receiv e technical data from third parties that is subject to the International T raffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State.

      "question": "How did the revenue growth trajectory of Microsoft's Server Products and Cloud Services segment in 2024 reflect the role of Client Access Licenses (CALs) tied to Windows Server, compared to the prior year's positioning?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Server Products and Cloud Services such as Windows Server and associated CALs, was highlighted as a core component of the company's hybrid and private cloud offerings. CALs were explicitly described as providing access rights to server products like Windows Server, directly tying their licensing model to the adoption of the underlying server infrastructure. By 2024, the Server Products and Cloud Services revenue growth metric was formally tracked and reported, indicating a more strategic emphasis on measuring and scaling this segment. The explicit mention of CALs in the 2024 revenue growth context shows that Microsoft leveraged the licensing model as a key enabler of server product adoption and monetization, suggesting that the earlier positioning of CALs in 2023 evolved into a quantifiable growth driver by 2024.",

        "Hop 2: Client Access Licenses (CALs) \u2192 Windows Server: CALs are explicitly tied to Windows Server, forming a licensing dependency and revenue linkage between the two entities.",

      "answer": "In 2022, QCOM disclosed that it had to constrain revenue recognition due to the risk of renegotiation or invalidation of license agreements, particularly with Chinese OEMs, and that it derived a significant portion of its licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees. By 2024, delays in finalizing new license agreements with key OEMs\u2014especially those in China\u2014exacerbated QCOM's dependency on a small group of licensees, increasing revenue concentration risk. These delays were tied to OEMs attempting to renegotiate royalty terms or delay payments, which in turn led to greater uncertainty in licensing cash flows and reinforced QCOM\u2019s reliance on a few large licensees, including those under pressure from China's Made in China 2025 policy to develop domestic semiconductor alternatives.",

Cash collected from customers prior to a contract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\n\nFrom time to time, regulatory authorities investigate our business practices, particularly with respect to our licensing business, and institute proceedings against us. Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. Additionally, from time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting, underpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items, evaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees' conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other items, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are newly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues have been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and contractual right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\n\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\n\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable, net (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations.\n\nConcentrations. A significant portion of our revenues are concentrated with a small number of customers/licensees of our QCT and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments. The comparability of customer/licensee concentrations for the periods presented are impacted by the timing of customer/licensees device launches and/or innovation cycles and other seasonal trends, among other fluctuations in demand. Revenues from each customer/licensee that were 10% or greater of total revenues were as follows:\n\n",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

          "chunk_text": "products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, which brought Activision Blizzard's existing debt obligations under Microsoft's consolidated financial reporting. These obligations included several senior notes with Wells Fargo Bank serving as trustee, such as the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2027 and the 1.350% Senior Notes due 2030. By 2024, Microsoft had entered into a partnership with Wells Fargo Bank, as evidenced by the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture dated November 6, 2023, indicating continued collaboration with Wells Fargo in managing debt instruments. This demonstrates that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023 directly expanded its debt structure in 2024 by incorporating Activision Blizzard's existing notes, with Wells Fargo maintaining a trustee role across both years.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices.

This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products.

By 2023, these risks persisted but were compounded by increased dependency on subcontractors for component procurement, with NVDA citing specific concerns about subcontractors prioritizing competitors, leading to potential shortages and quality issues.

Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. An error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial  shipments  could  result  in  failure  to  achieve  market  acceptance,  loss  of  design  wins,  and  harm  to  our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers' perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field.  If  a  product liability  claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert  the  efforts  of  our  technical  and  management  personnel  and  harm  our  business.  Further,  our  business  liability insurance  may  be  inadequate  or  future  coverage  may  be  unavailable  on  acceptable  terms,  which  could  adversely impact our financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business\n\nWe  are  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties  associated  with  international  operations,  including  adverse economic conditions, which may harm our business.\n\nWe conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\n- domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business;\n- differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;\n- domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;\n- disruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's significant 22.2% year-over-year revenue growth in Server Products and Cloud Services\u2014from $79.97 billion in 2023 to $97.73 billion in 2024\u2014enabled greater investment in hybrid cloud capabilities, as evidenced by the 2024 filing's description of System Center as a key tool for managing hybrid cloud environments. The 2024 Intelligent Cloud segment explicitly states that Server Products and Cloud Services include Azure and hybrid infrastructure tools like System Center, which are designed to support modern business and developers across both public and private cloud deployments. This indicates that the revenue growth directly supported Microsoft\u2019s strategic emphasis on hybrid cloud management through System Center, reinforcing its role in enabling seamless integration and operations across on-premises and cloud environments.",

Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products.

      "answer": "The revenue growth in Microsoft's Server Products and Cloud Services segment from $79.97 billion in 2023 to $97.73 billion in 2024 demonstrates that Windows Server remained a central element in Microsoft\u2019s hybrid cloud strategy. In both the 2023 and 2024 filings, Windows Server was explicitly included as a core part of the Server Products and Cloud Services portfolio, which powers modern business and developers through public, private, and hybrid environments. The 22.2% year-over-year increase in this segment suggests that Microsoft's focus on integrating on-premises infrastructure with Azure-based services resonated with enterprise customers, reinforcing the strategic positioning of Windows Server as a bridge between traditional IT and cloud-native operations. This aligns with Microsoft\u2019s description of Server Products as integrated infrastructure and middleware supporting applications built on Windows Server, indicating a consistent and effective strategic emphasis.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products.

      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft disclosed that the $986 million in Nuance convertible senior notes, issued in 2015 and 2017, had been substantially redeemed, signaling early integration steps. By 2024, the continued reference to these redeemed notes in the context of Nuance's integration into the Intelligent Cloud segment suggests that Microsoft is aligning Nuance's financial structure with its broader cloud strategy. The fact that the goodwill from the acquisition remained non-deductible and was tied to synergies expected from Nuance's integration indicates a strategic focus on long-term value creation rather than short-term tax benefits. This evolution reflects a deepening operational and financial integration of Nuance into Microsoft's cloud infrastructure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, QCOM identified significant cybersecurity risks tied to its licensees, including the potential for third-party breaches exposing proprietary information and the risk of former employees or business partners misappropriating intellectual property. These vulnerabilities created an environment where licensees might be reluctant or delayed in renewing agreements due to concerns over data integrity and IP protection. By 2024, this translated into observable delays and disputes in license agreement renewals, with some licensees underreporting, underpaying, or not paying royalties, which required QCOM to implement more conservative revenue recognition practices. Specifically, QCOM constrained revenue recognition in cases where there was uncertainty about the enforceability of license agreements or the likelihood of significant revenue reversal, even if amounts were contractually owed. This cautious approach was reflected in QCOM's accounting policy, which required estimates of royalty revenues based on licensee-reported data and market assessments, with adjustments made in subsequent periods as actual data became available.",

These attacks, which might be related to industrial, corporate or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other IT infrastructure and impersonating authorized users, among others. We are also subject to ransom-style cyber-attacks, which could expose our confidential or proprietary information, request payment of money and/or impact our IT systems and cause widespread disruption to our business, including our manufacturing operations. Third parties that store and/or process our confidential information, or that provide products, software or services used in our IT infrastructure (including applications), may be subject to similar attacks, which could also result in malware being introduced into our IT infrastructure, e.g., through the third parties' software and/or software updates. Such attacks could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our IT systems. We believe that we have a robust cybersecurity program that is aligned to international cybersecurity frameworks, and that we leverage industry best practices across people, processes and technologies in an attempt to mitigate cybersecurity threats. However, we cannot anticipate, detect, repel or implement fully effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. As part of our cybersecurity program, we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our IT systems and software (including third party software used in our IT systems) that could be exploited by hackers or other malicious actors. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or other attacks have in the past, in certain instances and to certain degrees, been successful (but have not caused significant harm), and may in the future be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.\n\nIn addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, wrongfully use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire our employees. See also the Risk Factor titled 'We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful.' Similarly, we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors. We also provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partners, including those affiliated with state actors and including in foreign jurisdictions where ownership restrictions may require us to take a minority ownership interest in the joint venture. Such joint venture partners may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors. Our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information that we have provided to customers, licensees or other business partners could also be wrongfully obtained by third parties through cyber-attacks on such customers', licensees' or other business partners' IT systems.\n\nThe misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our IT systems and our technology, intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information.\n\nFurther, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require our overall IT security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our contracts with certain of our customers require us to obtain cybersecurity certifications for our IT systems. Failure to obtain or maintain the necessary cybersecurity certifications could result in loss of future revenues, damage to our customer relationships and reputation, and a shift of business to our competitors.",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nLicense agreements contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that ex ists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated.\n\nLicensees pay per-unit royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and, to a lesser ex tent, lump sum payments (license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). License fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licenseeby-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is ex ecuted and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement. If all such conditions are not met, revenues and any associated receivables are generally not recognized until such time that the required conditions are met. Cash collected from customers prior to a contract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting, underpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items, evaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees' conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other items, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are newly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues have been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and enforceable right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\n\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\n\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable, net (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied",

      "question": "How did CRM's 2023 service disruptions, including the Heroku breach affecting customer credentials, influence their 2024 strategic investments in the Salesforce Platform partner ecosystem, particularly in expanding AppExchange and ISV relationships?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CRM experienced service disruptions, including a breach on Heroku that exposed customer credentials and encryption keys, raising concerns about ecosystem security and reliability. This event, combined with broader service defect risks, highlighted vulnerabilities in CRM's ecosystem partner dependencies, particularly as third-party integrations and customer data sharing increased the complexity of their IT systems. By 2024, CRM responded by doubling down on its partner ecosystem strategy, explicitly calling out the Salesforce Platform and AppExchange as key growth levers. They expanded the AppExchange marketplace and deepened relationships with ISVs and system integrators to enhance platform resilience, diversify solution offerings, and rebuild trust in their ecosystem. This strategic pivot aimed to not only recover from the reputational and operational damage of the 2023 disruptions but also to drive enterprise customer retention and attract new vertical markets through a more robust and extensible platform.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- an enterprise application marketplace and a community of tens of millions of Trailblazers: passionate developers, admins and experts who use Salesforce to innovate and extend the platform with thousands of partner applications.\n\n## Our Business and Growth Strategy\n\nWe continue to expand in the growing addressable markets across all of our service offerings. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. We orient our business strategy and invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities:\n\nExpand relationships with existing customers. We see significant opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships through cross-selling and upselling our service offerings. For example, we continue to focus on driving multiple service offering adoption, which provides our customers with a one-stop-shop for their front-office business technology needs. As our customers realize the benefits of our entire suite of service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customers' ex perience with new products and features and gain additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units. Finally, we aim to ex pand our relationships with ex isting customers through our additional support offerings.\n\nIncrease geographic reach. By extending our go-to-market capabilities globally, we aim to grow our business by selling to new customers in new regions. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in most major markets globally. We also plan to continue to develop distribution channels through new and existing marketplaces and partners for our solutions around the globe and new goto-market strategies. We continue to invest in our domestic and international operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world.\n\nFocus on industries and new products. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative and value-driven solutions in new categories based on our existing and potential customers' needs. For example, we provide out-of-the-box solutions specifically built for customers in certain industries, such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing and more. In addition, through direct discussions and strategic engagements with our customers, we are able to deliver the innovations and enhancements that align with the needs of our customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform for deploying autonomous AI agents across any business function. Agentforce includes a set of tools to create and customize AI agents, as well as a library of ready-to-use skills for any use case across sales, service, marketing and commerce, Tableau, Slack, partners and more.\n\nLeverage our partner ecosystem. The Salesforce Platform enables customers, independent software vendors ('ISVs') and third-party developers to create, test and deliver cloud-based applications. These applications can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by software vendors. In addition, we rely on our consulting partners to deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, from large-scale implementations to more limited solutions that help businesses run more efficiently. We continue to work with and invest in our partner ecosystem, including these ISVs and system integrators ('SIs'), to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries.\n\nPromote strong customer adoption and reduce customer attrition. We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. Our customer success programs, including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists, help enable and accelerate our customers' digital transformations. In addition, we have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies learn our systems and a community of Trailblazers who drive innovation. With these programs and resources, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions.\n\n## Mergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our Salesforce Platform. Our evaluation seeks to confirm that any potential acquisition accelerates our strategy, represents an attractive customer opportunity, provides a pathway to effectively monetize the acquired products and drive significant operational efficiencies and presents a clear timeline for value accretion. Our acquisitions can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and accelerate development of features to large-scale acquisitions that result in new service offerings. Our goal is to prioritize the use of our balance sheet, through cash and debt, to complete acquisitions.\n\nWe also manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and SIs. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company's initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, including AI. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find attractive, including investments in companies representing targeted businesses, technological initiatives and geographies. Our strategy includes growing our strategic investment portfolio, in part, by reinvesting proceeds from the sales of strategic investments.",

      "question": "How did the change in AVGO's reliance on TSMC for wafer manufacturing from 2023 to 2024 affect their exposure to supply chain risks related to product availability?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AVGO identified product availability as a key risk factor, citing regulatory, ESG, and technical compliance costs that could disrupt sourcing and availability of materials, including semiconductor components. By 2024, AVGO's reliance on TSMC increased significantly, with TSMC manufacturing approximately 95% of the wafers produced by AVGO's contract manufacturers (CMs). This deepened dependency on a single CM amplified AVGO's exposure to supply chain risks, as TSMC could prioritize other customers, raise prices, or reduce deliveries on short notice, directly impacting AVGO's ability to meet customer demand and fulfill contractual obligations. The shift from general supply chain risk in 2023 to concentrated dependency on TSMC in 2024 indicates a transformation in the nature of product availability risk, from regulatory and compliance-based to supplier-specific and operational.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes CMs, such as third-party wafer foundries. Our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques, and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our own or with a particular CM. Qualifying and establishing reliable production at acceptable yields with a new CM, if at all, is a lengthy and often expensive process.\n\nWe depend on our CMs to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. We do not generally have long-term capacity commitments with our CMs and substantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum quantities. Further, our CMs may fail to timely develop or successfully implement new, advanced manufacturing processes, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies. From time to time, our CMs may also cease to, or become unable to, manufacture a component for us.\n\nTSMC, one of our CMs, manufactured approximately 95% of the wafers manufactured by our CMs during fiscal year 2024. We believe our wafer requirements represent a meaningful portion of TSMC's total production capacity. However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including some of our competitors, and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. In addition, TSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to us.\n\nIf any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our customer demand, or to the same extent as our competitors, fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities. This could damage our relationships with our customers, result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations, or result in payment of significant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and gross margin.\n\n## We purchase a significant amount of the materials, including components, used in our products from a limited number of suppliers.\n\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. During fiscal year 2024, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials suppliers, some of which are single source suppliers. The lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials suppliers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices, any of which could disrupt supply or increase demand in the industry. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by i ncreased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China. Any such supply constraints could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## A prolonged disruption of our or our suppliers' manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the InP-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are concentrated in the same geographic regions of California and the Pacific Rim, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity, and i ncreases the risk of natural disasters impacting multiple suppliers. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located i n the Czech Republic, India, Israel, and the U.S., and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.\n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as climate change, water shortages, political unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, labor shortages, medical epidemics, economic instability, equipment failure or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. To date, such events have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, such an event could disrupt our operations, forgo revenue opportunities, potentially l ose market share, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some",

      "question": "How did AMD's compliance with its wafer purchase targets under the GF wafer supply agreement evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what were the financial implications tied to potential underutilization penalties?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD had a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that included annual wafer purchase targets through 2025, with pre-payments required in 2022 and 2023, and penalties if AMD did not meet the targets. In 2023, the same WSA remained in place, and AMD was still subject to penalties based on the difference between actual purchases and annual targets. The financial implications included potential excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs if AMD's actual wafer requirements were less than the targets, which could adversely impact gross margins in both years.

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

By 2024, Adobe had expanded its use of AI with offerings like Adobe Firefly, which increased its exposure to new AI regulations. The adoption of the EU AI Act in 2024 introduced stricter compliance requirements, raising concerns about inconsistencies across jurisdictions and increasing Adobe's compliance, governance, and R&D costs.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM  7.    MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe  following  discussion  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  Notes  thereto. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 27, 2020, filed with the SEC on January 15, 2021.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the  SEC,  we  make  assumptions,  judgments  and  estimates  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and expenses,  and  related  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities.  We  base  our  assumptions,  judgments  and  estimates  on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on  a  regular  basis.  We  also  discuss  our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nWe believe  that  the  assumptions,  judgments  and  estimates  involved  in  the  accounting  for  revenue  recognition,  business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components  of  our  results  of  operations  and  are  based  on  complex  rules  requiring  us  to  make  judgments  and  estimates,  and consequently,  we  consider  these  to  be  our  critical  accounting  policies.  Historically,  our  assumptions,  judgments  and  estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both onpremise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/ondevice software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the  cloud  services  are  provided.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  we  considered  the  nature  of  our  promise  to  Creative  Cloud  and Document  Cloud  customers,  which  is  to  provide  a  complete  end-to-end  creative  design  or  document  workflow  solution  that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.\n\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared  reviews  which  enable  simultaneous  editing  and  commenting  of  PDFs  across  desktop,  mobile  and  web;  automatic  cloud rendering  of  a  design  which  enables  it  to  be  worked  on  in  multiple  mediums;  and  Sensei,  Adobe's  cloud-hosted  artificial intelligence  and  machine  learning  framework,  which  enables  features  such  as  automated  photo-editing,  photograph  contentawareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon  their  estimated  fair  values  at  the  acquisition  date.  The  purchase  price  allocation  process  requires  management  to  make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:\n\n- future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;\n- expected costs to develop acquired technologies and patents internally into commercially viable products;",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\n\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD expressed significant concern about Intel's aggressive pricing strategies and its dominant influence over top-tier OEMs like Dell, noting that these practices historically resulted in lower unit sales and reduced average selling prices for AMD's products. This competitive disadvantage was compounded by Intel's ability to drive de facto x86 platform standards and offer preferential terms to its partners. By 2024, AMD's semi-custom SoC revenue became heavily dependent on Dell's product success, with AMD having no control over Dell's marketing efforts or market performance. The 2024 filing emphasized that any lack of success on Dell's part could directly reduce AMD's expected revenue, highlighting a continued vulnerability stemming from Intel's influence on OEM dynamics and AMD's strategic exposure to Dell's market outcomes.",

As a result, our ability to generate rev enue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers' desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers' products. Any rev enue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party's products and reflectiv e of their success in the market. Moreov er, we hav e no control ov er the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product rev enue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adv ersely affected.\n\n## Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nThe products that we sell are complex and hav e been and may in the future be subject to security v ulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prev ent and address security v ulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effectiv e or not successful at all. We may depend on v endors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end  users,  to  deploy  our  mitigations  alone  or  as  part  of  their  own  mitigations,  and  they  may  delay,  decline  or  modify  the  implementation  of  such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adv ersely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adv ersely affect our rev enue. We hav e and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security v ulnerabilities. Actual or perceiv ed security v ulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adv erse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or results of operations.\n\n## IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur business relies on technology hardware, software, cloud serv ices, infrastructure, networks and systems (collectiv ely,  IT   Systems).  We own and manage some IT Systems but also rely on critical third-party IT Systems, products and serv ices. In the ordinary course of business, we and v arious third-party prov iders and business partners process and maintain sensitiv e data, including personal information about workers, customers and others, as well  as  intellectual  property  and  proprietary  or  confidential  information  relating  to  our  business  and  that  of  our  customers  and  business  partners (collectiv ely, Confidential Data). Maintaining the av ailability, integrity and security of our IT  Systems and Confidential Data is critical to our business and reputation. While we and others hav e implemented v arious controls and defenses, AMD and companies like AMD and our v endors and customers hav e been and are increasingly subject to cybersecurity attacks, risks and threats. Threat factors range in sophistication from indiv idual hackers and insiders to ransom gangs and state-sponsored attackers. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our IT Systems or supply chain. The increased prev alence of remote working arrangements at AMD and our prov iders present additional operational risks and attack v ectors to our IT Systems. Our IT Systems and Confidential Data are v ulnerable to a range of cybersecurity risks and threats, including malicious code that is added to widely av ailable open-source software, compromised commercial software or security v ulnerabilities in our products or systems, or those of a third party, that  are  being  used  by  attackers  prior  to  mitigations  being  put  in  place,  such  as  zero-day  attacks.  Cyberattacks  hav e  and  may  come  into  our  IT Systems through the compromise of users' access credentials. Users' access credentials can be compromised by phishing, v ishing, smishing, multifactor authentication (MFA) prompt bombing, hacking, or other social engineering, cybersecurity, or theft activ ities.",

      "question": "How did the delay in the effective date of the Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations, first announced in Notice 2023-55 during Microsoft's 2023 fiscal year, impact the company's effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024, and what does this imply about Microsoft's tax planning strategy across years?",
      "answer": "The delay of the Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations, initially postponed to fiscal year 2024 via Notice 2023-55 and later indefinitely delayed by Notice 2023-80, contributed to a lower effective tax rate of 18% in fiscal year 2024 compared to 19% in fiscal year 2023. This tax benefit allowed Microsoft to continue leveraging its foreign regional operations center in Ireland, which generated 83% of foreign income before tax in 2024 (up from 81% in 2023), under more favorable tax conditions. The delay enabled Microsoft to maintain a tax planning strategy that maximized foreign tax credits and minimized U.S. tax exposure during the transition period, demonstrating strategic alignment with evolving regulatory timelines.",

        "Hop 1: MSFT(2023) \u2192 Notice 2023-55: Microsoft's effective tax rate in 2023 was 19%, partly due to the issuance of Notice 2023-55 which delayed the Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations to fiscal year 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Notice 2023-55 \u2192 Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations: The Notice delayed the effective date of the Final Foreign Tax Credit Regulations, allowing Microsoft temporary relief from new compliance requirements.",

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and serv ices through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 83% and 81% of our foreign income before tax.

By 2023, the integration had progressed to the point where Nuance's contributions were reflected in the Intelligent Cloud segment's goodwill, indicating deeper strategic alignment and expected synergies.

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## Other Planned Uses of Capital\n\nOn January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. ('Activision Blizzard') for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard's net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard's shareholders, and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well  as  continue  making  acquisitions  that  align  with  our  business  strategy. Additions  to  property  and  equipment  will  continue, including  new  facilities,  datacenters,  and  computer  systems  for  research  and  development,  sales  and  marketing,  support,  and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating  and  finance  leases  for  datacenters,  corporate  offices,  research  and  development  facilities,  Microsoft  Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nRefer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty  and  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.  We  have  critical  accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a  customer.  Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price ('SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's use of the 5.20% Notes due 2039 under BNY Mellon's trusteeship in 2023 relate to the continued use of BNY Mellon as trustee for newer debt instruments issued in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft continued to hold its 5.20% Notes due 2039 under the Base Indenture with BNY Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. In 2024, Microsoft issued newer debt instruments, including the 3.625% Notes due 2023 and 4.875% Notes due 2043, under the same trustee relationship with BNY Mellon Trust Company, N.A., indicating a consistent use of the same trust framework for debt issuance across both years.",

      "answer": "The 23.5% revenue growth in Server products and cloud services (from $79.97B to $97.73B) directly supported Microsoft's strategic positioning of Windows Server as a foundational component of their Intelligent Cloud segment. According to the 2024 filing, Server products are 'integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system,' indicating continued strategic emphasis on hybrid infrastructure capabilities. This growth enabled Microsoft to reinforce Windows Server's role alongside Azure in their public, private, and hybrid server offerings, as evidenced by the explicit inclusion of Windows Server in the 2024 filing's breakdown of Server products and cloud services revenue. The financial performance likely supported their focus on 'making IT professionals and developers more productive' through integrated server infrastructure, as stated in the 2024 document.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers.

Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

By 2024, Cisco confirmed it was subject to AI regulations globally, including those related to privacy, data protection, and operational resilience, which directly increased its compliance obligations and costs (CSCO_10k_2024.pdf:page_9:chunk_1). The evolving regulatory environment, as noted in GS_10k_2024.pdf:page_46:chunk_1, included increasing scrutiny and specific regulations targeting AI, which Cisco would have had to address as part of its global operations. Therefore, Cisco's active development and integration of AI technologies in 2023 directly contributed to its heightened exposure and associated compliance costs related to global AI regulations in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nWe rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary software in electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The manufacturing process also uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to International Organization for Standardization 9001 standards.\n\nOur arrangements with contract manufacturers generally  provide  for  quality,  cost,  and  delivery  requirements,  as  well  as  manufacturing  process  terms,  such  as inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-term contracts with any contract manufacturers. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis. These arrangements with contract manufacturers generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time.\n\n## Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing\n\nWe seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.\n\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.\n\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent  and  other  intellectual  property  rights.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  patents  and  other  proprietary  rights  will  not  be  challenged,  invalidated,  or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' including the risk factors entitled 'Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,' 'We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others,' and 'We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.'\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous regulations and laws in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business. Many of these regulations and laws are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by courts and regulators, remain uncertain. These regulations and laws involve a variety of matters including  privacy,  data  protection  and  personal  information,  cybersecurity,  operational  resilience,  artificial  intelligence,  tax ,  trade,  encryption  technology, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human rights, product certification, and national security.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco disclosed a $10.0 billion short-term commercial paper program with $0.6 billion outstanding, while no senior fixed-rate notes were issued at that time. By 2024, Cisco issued $13.5 billion in senior fixed-rate notes, which now rank at par with the commercial paper notes. This significant issuance of long-term debt in 2024 altered the capital structure by introducing a large fixed-rate debt component, which now coexists with the short-term commercial paper program, potentially affecting liquidity strategy and interest rate risk exposure.",

We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $0.6 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 30, 2022, and no commercial paper outstanding as of July 31, 2021.\n\nCredit Facility On May 13, 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0  billion  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility  that  is  scheduled  to  expire  on  May  13,  2026. As  of  July  30,  2022,  we  were  in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement.  Any  advances  under  the  5-year  credit  agreement  will  accrue  interest  at  rates  that  are  equal  to,  based  on  certain conditions, either (a) with respect to loans in U.S. dollars, (i) LIBOR or (ii) the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) a daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%), (b) with respect to loans in Euros, EURIBOR, (c) with respect to loans in Yen, TIBOR and (d) with respect to loans in Pounds Sterling, SONIA plus a credit spread adjustment, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Moody's Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the interest rate be less than 0.0%. We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.",

This swap converts the fixed interest rate of the fix ed-rate note to a floating interest rate based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The gain and loss related to the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap substantially offsets the change in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that is attributable to the change in market interest rates. For additional information, see Note 13.\n\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a makewhole premium. The senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes that have been issued pursuant to our short-term debt financing program, as discussed above under '(a) Short-Term Debt.' As of July 27, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.",

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's 2023 export control challenges influence its 2024 reliance on third-party manufacturers, and what impact did this have on inventory provisioning and gross margin in fiscal year 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NVIDIA faced significant export restrictions from the U.S. government targeting China and other regions, particularly affecting products like the A100, H100, and L40S GPUs. These restrictions disrupted demand forecasting and supply chain planning, as NVIDIA could no longer reliably serve certain international markets. By 2024, NVIDIA's reliance on third-party manufacturers remained high, with long lead times\u2014some exceeding twelve months\u2014requiring early, non-cancellable inventory orders and capacity commitments. This dependency, combined with the unpredictable demand caused by export controls, led to inventory provisioning challenges. Specifically, NVIDIA reported an unfavorable impact of 2.7% on gross margin in fiscal year 2024 due to inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-down items. This reflects how the 2023 export constraints indirectly exacerbated inventory risk and gross margin pressure in 2024 through a chain of supply chain dependency and demand forecasting instability.",

        "Hop 3: Third-Party Manufacturers \u2190 NVDA(2024): Inventory overruns and gross margin impact (2.7%) in 2024 were a result of early orders based on flawed forecasts shaped by 2023 export restrictions."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\ncommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\n\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly , ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\n\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity . We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\n\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross M argin discussion below in this M anagement's Discussion and A nalysis for further discussion.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality  to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Revenue Allowances\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\n\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or M DFs, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

      "answer": "In 2022, TXN's Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan allocated 79% of its assets to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents, reflecting a conservative investment strategy aimed at stable returns. This allocation decreased to 77% in 2024, indicating a slight shift toward more diversified or potentially higher-risk investments. The relationship between the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan and Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents remained significant, but the reduction suggests a strategic adjustment in the company's pension fund management. This evolution in allocation aligns with potential shifts in global market conditions or internal risk appetite, signaling a measured move away from ultra-conservative positioning in non-U.S. pension assets.",

These notes were a component of the broader Assumed Xilinx Notes and carried semi-annual fixed interest payments. By 2024, AMD's exposure to the 2.950% Notes had decreased significantly from $750 million in 2023 to $0 by the end of 2024, indicating full repayment or restructuring of this specific debt instrument.

      "answer": "In 2022, CSCO had $9.0 billion in senior fixed-rate notes outstanding, which ranked at par with potential future commercial paper notes. By 2024, CSCO introduced a significantly expanded short-term debt financing program of up to $15.0 billion through commercial paper notes. This suggests a strategic shift toward greater reliance on short-term financing instruments, possibly to maintain liquidity flexibility while managing long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. The 2022 disclosure of interest rate sensitivity ($0.3 billion fair value change for a 50 BPS rate shift) indicates awareness of market risks, which may have influenced the increased use of floating-rate commercial paper in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple specifically called out Taiwan as part of its supply chain risk exposure due to geopolitical tensions and pandemic-related disruptions, noting that manufacturing in Asia\u2014including Taiwan\u2014was critical to its operations. The 2022 filing also clarified that Greater China includes Taiwan, linking supply chain dependencies directly to a reportable segment. By 2023, Apple disclosed that iPhone revenue represented a 'moderately higher proportion' of net sales in Greater China compared to other regions. This implies that Apple's strategic positioning in Greater China\u2014where it saw growing iPhone revenue\u2014was partially underpinned by manufacturing operations in Taiwan, a region it had flagged as a risk in the prior year. This creates a situation where Apple's financial performance in a key growth region is tightly coupled with a jurisdiction it identifies as a supply chain vulnerability.",

        "Hop 1: AAPL(2022) \u2192 Taiwan: Apple explicitly listed Taiwan as a key manufacturing location and highlighted its exposure to supply chain risks there due to geopolitical tensions and pandemic disruptions.",

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices.

Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software.

This redemption reduced Microsoft's exposure to legacy Nuance liabilities, facilitating deeper integration into the Intelligent Cloud segment, which was already attributed with the full amount of Nuance-related goodwill. By 2024, Microsoft continued to depend on Nuance for expected synergies within the Intelligent Cloud, suggesting that the redemption had not disrupted strategic integration but rather supported it by removing a legacy financial constraint.

          "chunk_text": "We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products that implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "answer": "In 2023, Intel emphasized FPGAs as a key part of its xPU strategy to meet diverse computing needs, with Altera being central to this effort by producing programmable semiconductors for embedded, communications, and cloud enterprise markets. However, by 2024, Intel began pursuing a monetization path for Altera, including a potential IPO, as part of a broader strategy to focus on core product and manufacturing capabilities. This shift was accompanied by a $6.7 billion drop in intersegment cost of goods sold from lower sales volume in 2023, signaling reduced internal investment in non-core segments like Altera. The decision to divest Altera reflects a strategic pivot to streamline operations and unlock value, aligning with Intel's focus on its internal foundry model and core x86/xPU offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed.\n\nOur implementation of new business strategies, including our foundry strategy and our cost reduction measures, as well as our many internal structural, systems, and process changes, may subject us to a number of risks. We have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitaliz e on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand, ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, A I, and sensing. As part of our strategy, we announced plans to establish Intel Foundry as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product-based business units. The implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural, system, and process changes to support the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business, including a new enterprise resource planning system. In parallel, we are undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business, such as operating Intel Foundry, A ltera and IM S, as autonomous subsidiaries that we majority own and consolidate in order to potentially raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities. Significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NA ND memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition in not just new and evolving markets but also in our existing markets. These new sources of competition can include established competitors with well-developed and highly competitive technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, A I and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to dev elop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. We may also not be successful in developing a competitive foundry business for external customers with respect to either leading-edge or mature process nodes, which would make it difficult for us to realize a favorable return on our investments in process technology and manufacturing capacity investments. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.\n\n## Our Smart Capital approach to capital spending, alternative financing arrangements, and pursuit of government grants involves risks and may not be successful.\n\nAs we pursue our strategy, we have utilized our Smart Capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and scale our capital investments. To support our capital investments, we have pursued alternative financing arrangements, such as our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our Arizona campus, and our 2024 joint investment with A pollo related to Fab 34 in Ireland, and may enter into similar arrangements in the future. These transactions may fail to advance our business strategy, may include unfavorable pricing or other terms such as penalties should key metrics not be attained as prescribed by our agreements, and may fail to achieve their anticipated benefits. Both arrangements include commitments we may not be able to satisfy, including commitments relating to construction and/or wafer demand or purchase, in which case we may be required to make additional payments to our partners. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a $755 million charge related to penalties we expect to pay in connection with Ireland SCIP for construction delays we decided to make as we reduced our near-term capacity requirements. Further, both arrangements are expected to significantly and increasingly impact our net income (loss) attributable to Intel and earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel in future periods as wafer production volumes increase at our expanded Arizona campus and at Fab 34 in Ireland. Our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to resolv e any  potential disputes. A ny  of these risks, including our ability  to effectuate any  additional transactions at all, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital for our required investments.\n\nIn addition, as part of our Smart Capital approach, we have applied for, received, and expect to receive additional grants and incentives from domestic and foreign local, regional, and national governments. Legislation in the US and EU has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions. However, any amounts, if any, we may receive under any agreements enabled by such legislation may not be sufficient in amount or timeliness to support our capital investment plans and offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as compared to those of many of our competitors, we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of any such grants and incentives, or such agreements may contain restrictions that limit our flex ibility  to pursue changes in business strategy  or transactions that may enhance stockholder value. For example, in November 2024 we entered into a direct funding agreement with the US Department of Commerce under the CHIPS Act that contains detailed milestones we must achieve for us to receive the funds, including with respect to achievement of various milestones with respect to capital expenditures, facility completion, process technology development, wafer production, Intel products insourcing, and external foundry customer acquisitions. It also contains restrictions on certain 'change of control' transactions we are permitted to engage in, a requirement that we share with the US government project returns above specified thresholds, and various termination rights and remedies if we were to breach the agreement, including potential repayment of some or all of the awards. To the extent funding is below our expectations, we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements, we are required to return any amounts received from any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations contained therein, we are subject to restrictions as a result of any awards we have accepted, or the US government delays or does not provide any awards",

In response, IBM's 2024 filings highlighted the introduction of enhanced explainable AI features within its hybrid cloud and AI platform, designed to provide greater transparency into model outputs and decision logic (Hop3 Evidence). These features were specifically aligned with the regulatory environment described in 2023, such as requirements for explainability and bias reduction in AI systems. Hop2 Evidence from GS_10k_2024.pdf further supports the regulatory pressure on explainability and bias, noting that opaque AI models increase compliance risks and that firms must implement controls to meet emerging standards.

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-TabulatingRecording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 12.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 12 to 14.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 14 to 15.\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\n\nWe proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers, global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients' complex business challenges while accelerating growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others.\n\nCompanies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new competitors.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nOur breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong focus on innovation. All of these attributes position IBM for accelerated growth now and prepare us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD had an existing Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc., including amendments dated May 12, 2021, and December 23, 2021, which governed the supply of wafers. By 2023, this agreement had evolved into a structured arrangement with minimum annual capacity allocation commitments from GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF) through 2025, in exchange for AMD's corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If AMD fails to meet these purchase targets, it must pay GF a portion of the difference. This indicates a shift from a more flexible supply arrangement in 2022 to a more binding, long-term commitment structure in 2023 with defined financial consequences.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's relationship with the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 evolve between 2022 and 2024, given the company's announcement to acquire Activision Blizzard in 2022 and the subsequent filing of a new indenture related to these notes in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc., signaling the beginning of a strategic relationship with the game developer. By 2024, Microsoft had filed a new indenture related to Activision Blizzard's 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, indicating that the acquisition had progressed to the point of formalizing financial instruments previously issued by Activision Blizzard under Microsoft's corporate structure. This suggests that the acquisition was not only strategic in content and market positioning but also involved the assumption and formal documentation of Activision Blizzard's existing financial obligations, such as the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, as part of Microsoft's broader financial portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1\n\nWith  three  billion  people  actively  playing  games  today,  and  a  new  generation  steeped  in  interactive  entertainment,  Microsoft continues to invest in content, community, and cloud services. We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end,  from  the  way  games  are  created  and  distributed  to  how  they  are  played,  including  cloud  gaming  so  players  can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers, including the acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC. In January 2022, we announced  plans  to  acquire Activision  Blizzard,  Inc.,  a  leader  in  game  development  and  an  interactive  entertainment  content publisher. Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft's game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.\n\n## Our Future Opportunity\n\nThe case for digital transformation has never been more urgent. Customers are looking to us to help improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\n\n- Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.\n- Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n- Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer's behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication.\n- Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.\n- Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment.\n- Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more.\n\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n## Commitment to Sustainability\n\nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built  on  this  pledge  by  adding  commitments  to  be  water  positive  by  2030,  zero  waste  by  2030,  and  to  protect  ecosystems  by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nFiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due in substantial part to significant  global  datacenter  expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won't always be linear.",

      "question": "How did the change in Apple's VAR model results from 2022 to 2023 reflect the company's evolving use of foreign exchange derivatives as a risk management tool?",
      "answer": "Apple's VAR model estimated a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, up from $550 million in the prior year, indicating increased exposure or volatility in its foreign exchange derivative positions. By 2023, Apple was using a variance/co-variance technique in its VAR model, which showed a VAR of $255 million at September 28, 2024, down from $284 million at September 30, 2023, due to reduced interest rate volatility. This decrease suggests that Apple's hedging strategies involving foreign exchange derivatives had become more effective or were adjusted in response to market conditions. Supporting this, Apple's 2023 disclosures indicate active use of forwards, cross-currency swaps, and other instruments to hedge term debt and marketable securities from foreign exchange fluctuations, with hedges designated for up to 18 years into the future.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AAPL(2022) \u2192 VAR Model: Apple disclosed using a Monte Carlo simulation-based VAR model, estimating a $1.0 billion maximum one-day loss in fair value for foreign exchange derivatives as of September 24, 2022.",
        "Hop 2: VAR Model \u2192 Foreign Exchange Derivatives: The VAR model included foreign exchange derivatives as part of its risk analysis framework, using a variance/co-variance technique to estimate potential losses.",

          "chunk_text": "To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk ('VAR') model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  were  excluded  from  the  model.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  model,  the  Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum  one-day  loss  in  fair  value  of  $550  million  as  of  September  25,  2021.  Because  the  Company  uses  foreign  currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual  future  gains  and  losses  associated  with  the  Company's  investment  portfolio,  debt  and  derivative  positions  may  differ materially  from  the  sensitivity  analyses  performed  as  of  September  24,  2022  due  to  the  inherent  limitations  associated  with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company's actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products. CALs prov ide access rights to certain serv er products, including SQL Serv er and Windows Serv er, and rev enue is reported along with the associated serv er product.",

      "question": "How did AMD's financial obligations under the Wafer Supply Agreement with GF in 2022 influence its dependency risk on GF in 2023, particularly in light of GF's minimum capacity allocation commitments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GF that required AMD to meet annual wafer purchase targets through 2025, with financial penalties for shortfalls. This created a binding financial exposure, as AMD was also obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts in 2022 and 2023. By 2023, AMD's dependency on GF remained significant, as GF was still required to provide minimum annual capacity allocations under the WSA. However, AMD retained the flexibility to work with other foundries, which partially mitigated dependency risk. Despite this flexibility, if GF failed to meet its capacity obligations, AMD faced significant shipment delays, highlighting that the 2022 agreement still shaped its operational risk profile in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD(2022) \u2192 Wafer Supply Agreement: AMD had binding obligations under the WSA, including annual purchase targets and pre-payments to GF through 2025.",
        "Hop 2: Wafer Supply Agreement \u2192 GF: The WSA obligated GF to provide minimum annual capacity allocations to AMD through 2025, with financial penalties if AMD failed to meet purchase targets.",
        "Hop 3: GF \u2190 AMD(2023): AMD still depended on GF\u2019s capacity allocation in 2023, and GF\u2019s failure to meet these commitments could result in significant shipment delays, indicating continued risk exposure."

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

      "answer": "Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from Greater China in 2022, which includes Taiwan. This significant revenue contribution from the region likely reinforced Apple\u2019s continued reliance on manufacturing partners based in Taiwan, as highlighted in the 2024 filing, where geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions in Taiwan were cited as material risks. The inclusion of Taiwan in the Greater China segment in 2022 shows Apple's operational integration of the region, which in 2024 translated into a strategic dependency on its manufacturing infrastructure, increasing exposure to potential geopolitical and operational disruptions.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical ev ents, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, T aiwan and V ietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictiv e measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company's business and supply chain in accordance with new or  changed  restrictions  on  international  trade  can  be  expensive,  time-consuming  and  disruptive  to  the  Company's  operations.  Such  restrictions  can  be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty , and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.  For  example,  tensions  between  governments,  including  the  U.S.  and  China,  have  in  the  past  led  to  tariffs  and  other  restrictions  affecting  the Company's business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future,  actions  by  governments  in  response  could  be  significantly  more  severe  and restrictiv e and could materially adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company's and its suppliers' operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company's control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\n\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings, increase the Company's costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\n\nThe Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation. M ajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the  Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company . While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain ty pes of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD held $750 million in aggregate principal of the 2.375% Notes due 2030. These notes were part of a broader set of debt instruments, including the Assumed Xilinx Notes, which AMD took on as part of the Xilinx acquisition and were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. By 2024, AMD unconditionally guaranteed Xilinx's 2.375% Notes due 2030, which imposed additional restrictions on AMD, including limitations on creating liens, entering into sale and leaseback transactions, and merging or selling substantially all assets. This indicates that AMD's financial exposure and covenant constraints related to the 2.375% Notes increased due to the integration of the Xilinx Notes into its capital structure.",

The supplemental indenture gov erning the Assumed X ilinx Notes also contain v arious cov enants which limit our ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or conv ey, transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another person.\n\nWe also have an unsecured revolv ing credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion (Rev olv ing Credit Agreement). Our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement contains various cov enants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest cov erage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreement gov erning our conv ertible notes and our Revolv ing  Credit Agreement  contains  prov isions  whereby  a  payment  default  or  acceleration  under  certain  agreements  with  respect  to  other  material indebtedness would result in cross defaults under our conv ertible indenture or the Rev olv ing Credit Agreement and allow note holders or the lenders under our Revolv ing Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under certain of our indentures or the Rev olv ing Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders under our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will hav e sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.\n\nAlso,  we  enter  into  sale  and  factoring  arrangements  from  time  to  time  with  respect  to  certain  accounts  receiv ables,  which  arrangements  are  nonrecourse to us in the ev ent that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated  to  repurchase  such  accounts  receiv ables  or  otherwise  incur  liability  to  the  counterparties  under  these  arrangements  under  certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October 2023 influence the transition of its senior note trusteeship from Wells Fargo Bank to Computershare Trust Company in October 2024, and what impact did this have on the internal control reporting for Microsoft's consolidated financial statements?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October 2023 triggered a restructuring of its debt obligations, including the administration of senior notes. As evidenced in the 2024 10-K filing, by October 2024, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. replaced Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as the trustee for Activision Blizzard's 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, 1.350% Senior Notes due 2030, and other obligations. This transition is directly linked to Microsoft's acquisition and subsequent integration of Activision Blizzard\u2019s financial structure. Notably, the 2024 audit report explicitly states that Activision Blizzard\u2019s internal controls were excluded from the assessment, representing less than 1% of Microsoft's total assets and 2% of total revenues, which may reflect the complexity and timing of integrating a newly acquired subsidiary\u2019s financial reporting systems into Microsoft\u2019s broader internal control framework.",

        "Hop 1: MSFT(2023) \u2192 Wells Fargo Bank,National Association: Microsoft had Wells Fargo Bank as a trustee for Activision Blizzard's 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 as of November 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Wells Fargo Bank,National Association \u2192 Activision Blizzard, Inc.: Wells Fargo Bank was the trustee for Activision Blizzard's debt obligations, including multiple senior notes.",
        "Hop 3: Activision Blizzard, Inc. \u2190 MSFT(2024): By October 2024, Microsoft transitioned the trusteeship of Activision Blizzard\u2019s notes to Computershare Trust Company, and Activision Blizzard\u2019s internal controls were excluded from Microsoft\u2019s consolidated internal control assessment."

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total rev enues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiv eness of internal control ov er financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting.

Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices.

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\n## Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\n## Note 13 - Segment Information and G eographic Data\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the A mericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of A sia Pacific. A mericas includes both North and South A merica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the M iddle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and T aiwan.

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

          "chunk_text": "We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products that implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "answer": "In 2023, Qualcomm identified intense competition and rapid technological change as key risks to their 5G business, which was central to their revenue model. That same year, they explicitly positioned XR (including AR, VR, and MR) as a key use case enabled by 5G technology, highlighting its potential for immersive experiences like cloud gaming and high-definition video streaming. By 2024, Qualcomm had incorporated XR into their consumer product segment alongside PCs, tablets, and other devices, signaling a strategic pivot to leverage 5G capabilities in differentiating their offerings. This evolution shows how Qualcomm responded to 5G market pressures by expanding into XR, a use case they had earlier identified as dependent on their core 5G technology.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Industry Solutions as part of its Enterprise and Partner Services, saw a decline in revenue from $7,900M in 2023 to $7,594M in 2024. This suggests a shift or potential underperformance in the strategic focus or execution of services like Industry Solutions, which are designed to deliver tailored, integrated, and secure productivity tools. The drop indicates a contraction in this area, possibly due to reduced investment, market competition, or a reallocation of resources to other growth areas within the cloud ecosystem.",

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud serv ices, including Azure and other cloud serv ices; SQL Serv er, Windows Serv er, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ('CALs'); and Nuance and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise and partner serv ices, including Enterprise Support Serv ices, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional serv ices, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\n\n## Server Products and Cloud Services\n\nAzure is a comprehensiv e set of cloud serv ices that offer dev elopers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or dev ice. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application serv ices, AI, Internet of Things ('IoT'), cognitiv e serv ices, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers. Server products rev enue is mainly affected by purchases through v olume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), and retail packaged products.

      "answer": "In February 2024, CSCO issued $13.5 billion in senior fixed-rate notes (Hop2), which were ranked at par with the commercial paper notes issued under the company's $15.0 billion short-term debt program (Hop3). In 2023, CSCO disclosed that a 50 BPS change in interest rates would impact the fair value of its fixed-rate debt by $0.7 billion (Hop1). By 2024, the coexistence of a large fixed-rate debt issuance and a robust commercial paper program meant that while the fixed-rate debt provided long-term stability, the commercial paper exposure increased sensitivity to short-term interest rate fluctuations. This dual structure likely balanced long-term financing with liquidity flexibility but introduced a more complex interest rate risk profile compared to 2023.",

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021.

We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency.

Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.\n\nHighlights from fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 included:\n\n- Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue increased 32% to $91.2 billion.\n- Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 18%.\n- Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 59.7 million.\n- LinkedIn revenue increased 34%.\n- Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 39%.\n- Server products and cloud services revenue increased 28% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 45%.\n- Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing ('Windows OEM') revenue increased 11%.\n- Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11%.\n- Xbox content and services revenue increased 3%.\n- Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 27%.\n- Surface revenue increased 3%.\n\nOn March 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. ('Nuance') for a total purchase price of $18.8 billion,  consisting  primarily  of  cash.  Nuance  is  a  cloud  and  artificial  intelligence  ('AI')  software  provider  with  healthcare  and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 - Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

Azure's competitiv e advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesiv e infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. Our AI offerings compete with AI products from hyperscalers such as Amazon and Google, as well as products from other emerging competitors, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, and other open source offerings, many of which are also current or potential partners. Our Azure Security offerings include our cloud security solution and security information and ev ent management solution, which compete with companies such as Palo Alto Networks and Cisco. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity v endors, security solution v endors, and numerous other security point solution v endors.

      "question": "How did the impact of gray market sales on AMD's demand forecasting accuracy evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what were the implications for the company's supply chain efficiency and revenue margins?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD identified that gray market sales created 'shadow inventory' that made demand forecasting difficult, directly impacting its ability to meet customer demand and negatively affecting margins due to competition with heavily discounted gray market products. By 2024, AMD continued to face similar challenges, with gray market activities still undermining forecasting accuracy and supply chain efficiency. Despite ongoing efforts to manage third-party logistics and distribution, the persistence of gray market sales suggests that AMD did not fully resolve the forecasting challenges, which continued to negatively impact revenue margins and customer satisfaction. The recurring issue highlights a lack of progress in mitigating the downstream effects of unauthorized product diversion.",

In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop  application  services,  business  and  software  support  applications,  server  and  storage  administration,  data center  operations,  database  administration  and  voice,  video  and  remote  access.  We  cannot  guarantee  that  these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case  our  internal  operations  and  the  distribution  of  our  products  to  our  customers  could  be  materially  adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.\n\n## Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the 'gray market.' Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray  market  products,  which  adversely  affects  demand  for  our  products  and  negatively  impacts  our  margins.  In addition,  our  inability  to  control  gray  market  activities  could  result  in  customer  satisfaction  issues  because  any  time products  are  purchased  outside  our  authorized  distribution  channels  there  is  a  risk  that  our  customers  are  buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Government actions and regulations such as export administration regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.\n\nWe have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. In October 2019, the BIS added additional Chinese entities to the Entity List. Also, the United States administration has called for changes  to domestic and foreign policy. Specifically, United States-China trade relations  remain uncertain. The United States administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin, and China has imposed tariffs in response to the actions of the United States. We are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and AMD processor-based products. There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our customers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect  on  our  business. A  significant  trade  disruption  or  the  establishment  or  increase  of  any  tariffs,  trade  protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business.\n\n## If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income  and  reduce  income  taxes  payable  in  future  periods.  Each  quarter,  we  consider  both  positive  and  negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft's Office product was distributed through OEMs, direct enterprise agreements, and resellers, with a focus on licensing flexibility and integration with cloud services like Office 365. Office faced competition from Zoom, which offered videoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. By 2024, Microsoft explicitly reinforced its competitive stance against Zoom by emphasizing 'powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools' that work well with existing on-premises or cloud technologies. This evolution was supported by Microsoft's broader Intelligent Cloud strategy, including Azure and server products, which enabled deeper integration and ecosystem partnerships, allowing Microsoft to offer a more cohesive and scalable collaboration environment compared to Zoom\u2019s standalone videoconferencing offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's redemption of Nuance's convertible senior notes between 2022 and 2024 impact the financial structure of the Intelligent Cloud segment, particularly in relation to the remaining liabilities and goodwill attributed to Nuance?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft disclosed that $986 million of convertible senior notes issued by Nuance (mostly redeemed prior to June 30, 2022), with $1 million remaining and classified as other current liabilities. By 2024, the filing noted that 'substantially all' of these notes had been redeemed. This reduction in outstanding liabilities reflects a decrease in financial obligations tied to the Nuance acquisition. Simultaneously, goodwill attributed to Nuance remained in the Intelligent Cloud segment, indicating that despite the redemption progress, Microsoft continued to rely on Nuance for strategic synergies. The evolution of this liability and its relationship to Nuance highlights a shift in Microsoft's financial exposure to the subsidiary while maintaining operational dependency.",

        "Hop 2: Convertible Senior Notes \u2192 Nuance: The convertible senior notes were originally issued by Nuance, and their redemption status changed significantly between 2022 and 2024.",

      "question": "How did the gross margin performance of Cisco's Advanced Services in 2023 influence the credit loss provisions associated with Loan Receivables in 2024, particularly in light of the 1.7 percentage point margin increase and the $7 million reduction in loan receivables credit loss provisions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Cisco's Advanced Services contributed to a 1.7 percentage point increase in services gross margin, driven by favorable service mix and lower delivery costs. Since Advanced Services are a key component of the financing arrangements included in Loan Receivables (which often fund services deployment), stronger service performance likely improved client repayment capacity. This is reflected in 2024, where the credit loss allowance for Loan Receivables saw a $7 million reduction in provisions, suggesting improved credit quality or lower expected defaults on financing arrangements tied to service contracts. The evolution from margin improvement in services to lower credit loss risk in receivables indicates a positive cascading effect across the entity chain.",

By 2023, this allocation shifted to a range of 65% to 80%, showing a slightly more variable approach, potentially reflecting adjustments in market conditions or a recalibration of risk tolerance.

          "chunk_text": "Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore, resulting in greater costs to us, and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate have proposed legislation regulating artificial intelligence and non-personal data that may impose significant requirements on how we design, build and deploy artificial intelligence and handle non-personal data for ourselves and our clients.\n\n## Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.\n\nOur clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting, information technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries, or failure to comply with applicable IT security or supply chain requirements, could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work. Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.\n- If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.\n- U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and heightened disclosure obligations. From time to time we have made disclosures. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of 'credible evidence' of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters may also lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including those described above.\n- Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.\n- Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate. For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.\n- Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm derived a significant portion of its licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, including several Chinese OEMs, and noted concerns over potential vertical integration by these OEMs due to pressures from the Made in China 2025 campaign and trade tensions. By 2023, Qualcomm reiterated its dependence on Chinese OEMs for licensing revenue but highlighted increased risks as certain customers had already begun developing their own integrated circuit products, which could reduce their reliance on Qualcomm\u2019s offerings and adversely impact future licensing revenue. This indicates a growing vulnerability in Qualcomm\u2019s revenue model tied to Chinese OEMs, driven by their strategic moves toward self-sufficiency in semiconductor development.",

Risk Factors' and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in 'Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and 2021. Discussions of fiscal 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2021.\n\n## Our Business and Operating Segments\n\nWe develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.\n\nFurther information regarding our business and operating segments is provided in 'Part I, Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's pension plan assets included high-yield bonds as part of its fixed income allocation, which was fully aligned with a liability-driven investment strategy aimed at minimizing market and interest rate risks. By fiscal year 2023, the company continued to allocate 100% of its U.S. qualified pension plan assets to fixed income, maintaining allocations to both long-term core bonds and high-yield bonds. The continuation of high-yield bond exposure within fixed income suggests that Broadcom maintained a balanced risk/return profile in its pension fund strategy, prioritizing liability matching while allowing for modest risk-taking through high-yield instruments.",

Our benefit plan investment committee has set the investment strategy to fully match the liability. We direct the overall portfolio allocation and use a third-party investment consultant that has the discretion to structure portfolios and select the investment managers within those allocation parameters. Multiple investment managers are utilized, including both active and passive management approaches. The plan assets are invested using the liability-driven investment strategy intended to minimize market and interest rate risks, and those assets are periodically rebalanced toward asset allocation targets.\n\nThe target asset allocation for the U.S. qualified pension plan reflects a risk/return profile that we believe is appropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation of plan assets relative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. For both fiscal years 2022 and 2021, 100% of the U.S. qualified pension plan assets were allocated to fixed income, in line with the target allocation. The fixed income allocation is primarily directed toward longterm core bond investments, with smaller allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and high-yield bonds.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's redemption of Nuance's convertible senior notes between 2022 and 2024 impact the financial structure of the Intelligent Cloud segment, particularly in relation to the remaining liabilities tied to Nuance?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft disclosed that $986 million of convertible senior notes were issued by Nuance, with $985 million redeemed prior to June 30, 2022, leaving $1 million remaining and classified as other current liabilities. By 2024, Microsoft noted that 'substantially all' of the $986 million in Nuance convertible notes had been redeemed, indicating a near-complete resolution of this liability. This evolution in the redemption status of the notes, linked to the integration of Nuance into the Intelligent Cloud segment, suggests a reduction in financial obligations that likely contributed to a more stable financial structure for the segment. The reduction in outstanding liabilities aligns with the strategic integration of Nuance and supports the realization of synergies cited in both years.",

      "question": "How did AMD's wafer supply agreement terms with GF in 2023 influence its capacity allocation risk and inventory cost pressures in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD had a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that required annual wafer purchase targets through 2025, with penalties if AMD failed to meet those targets. This created a risk of excess inventory or higher unit costs if actual wafer needs were lower than targets. By 2024, AMD extended the agreement through 2026 with GF still providing minimum annual capacity allocation. However, AMD faced inventory loss in Q1 2024 due to an incident at a contract manufacturer, compounding the risk of inventory cost pressures from the binding purchase targets in the GF agreement. This shows how the 2023 agreement terms directly shaped AMD's 2024 supply chain risk profile, particularly around inventory cost volatility and capacity constraints.",

If  we  experience  supply  constraints  from  our  third-party  manufacturing  suppliers,  we  may  be  required  to  allocate  the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our customers, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it  could  result  in  lost  sales  and  hav e  a  material  adv erse  effect  on  our  business.  For  example,  if  T SMC  is  not  able  to  manufacture  wafers  for  our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.\n\nWe do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain many of these manufacturing serv ices on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to prov ide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliv er those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or  eliminate  deliv eries  to  us,  which  could  hav e  a  material  adv erse  effect  on  our  business.  If  we  ov erestimate  our  customer  demand  or  experience  a decrease  in  customer  demand,  either  could  result  in  excess  inv entory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs.  We  are  party  to  a  wafer  supply agreement with GF where GF will prov ide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us and set pricing through 2026. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could hav e excess inv entory or higher inv entory unit costs, both of which may adv ersely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  ov er  deliv ery  schedules,  yield,  cycle  times,  quality assurance,  price  increases,  lack  of  capacity  in  periods  of  excess  demand,  misappropriation  of  our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  sev eral subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inv entory and parts. Moreov er, if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, water shortages, or high heat ev ents, lack sufficient capacity to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial  difficulties,  are  unable  to  secure  necessary  raw  materials  from  their  suppliers,  suffer  any  other disruption  or  reduction  in  efficiency,  or  experience  uncertain  env ironmental,  social,  atmospheric  or  natural,  economic  or  political  circumstances  or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, we experienced some inv entory loss due to an incident at a contract manufacturer. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of  our  products.  If  we  experience  problems  with  product  quality  or  are  unable  to  secure  sufficient  capacity  from  a  particular  third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely secure an alternativ e supply for any specific product. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternativ e third-party manufacturers, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectiv ely, the ATMP  JVs) with affiliates of  T ongfu  Microelectronics  Co.,  Ltd.  T he  majority  of  our ATMP serv ices are prov ided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.",

      "question": "How did the allocation to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents in 2022 influence the funding strategy for TXN's Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan as reflected in the long-term rate of return assumptions in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TXN allocated 79% of its Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan assets to Fixed Income Securities and Cash Equivalents, indicating a conservative investment strategy. By 2024, the long-term rate of return assumption for these plan assets increased to 4.28%, up from 3.50% in 2023, suggesting a strategic shift toward potentially higher-yielding investments. This evolution implies that while the plan was heavily reliant on fixed income instruments in 2022, TXN adjusted its funding strategy by 2024 to target a higher return, possibly to address long-term obligations more aggressively.",

      "answer": "The $306 million decline in Enterprise and partner services revenue from $7,900 million in fiscal 2023 to $7,594 million in fiscal 2024 occurred despite Microsoft's overall Intelligent Cloud revenue growing from $79,970 million to $97,726 million, suggesting a relative de-emphasis on partner-centric services like the Microsoft Partner Network. While the 2024 filing still lists Microsoft Partner Network as part of Enterprise and partner services, the segment's contraction contrasts with robust growth in Azure and other cloud services, indicating a potential reallocation of resources toward direct cloud offerings rather than channel partner development.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm highlighted that OEMs were increasingly lobbying regulators to impose compulsory licensing as a strategy to reduce royalty payments, which created uncertainty in revenue recognition and required significant legal resources. By 2024, this trend manifested in specific behaviors, such as Transsion delaying entry into a license agreement and selling unlicensed 5G products, prompting Qualcomm to initiate litigation across multiple jurisdictions. Despite entering into a licensing agreement with Transsion in 2024, Qualcomm had to balance enforcement actions with partnership dynamics, reflecting a strategic evolution from reliance on regulatory compliance to active legal defense and negotiation with OEMs.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful.\n\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. In addition, in order to extend our business into certain new and expanded product areas and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we need to attract, retain and motivate engineering and other technical personnel with specialized skills in these areas, and these skills are in high demand among our competitors. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees or employment candidates, including by establishing or expanding local offices near our headquarters in San Diego, California. Further, the increased availability of remote working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and/or offer compensation in excess of what we offer or other benefits that we generally do not offer, such as the ability to permanently work from home. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed. The COVID-19 pandemic caused us to modify our workforce practices, including having the vast majority of our employees work from home. While we have generally reopened our offices, we are currently operating under a hybrid work model, meaning that the majority of our employees have the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time. The hybrid work model may impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture, and may cause disruptions among our employees, including decreases in productivity, challenges in communications between on-site and off-site employees and, potentially, employee dissatisfaction and attrition. Further, any future attempt to transition away from the hybrid work model to more stringent on-site work requirements may result in employee dissatisfaction and attrition. If we fail to retain key employees or maintain employee productivity as a result of the hybrid work model or an attempt to return to more on-site work, our business could be adversely impacted.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS\n\nThe continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.\n\nWe own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.\n\nOur patent license agreements in effect that generate a significant portion of our licensing revenues are effective for a specified term. To receive royalties after the expiration date of the specified term, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We might not be able to extend or modify license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without negatively affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. In some circumstances, we may extend, modify or enter into new license agreements as a result of arbitration or litigation, and terms imposed by arbitrators or courts may be less favorable to us than existing terms and may impact the financial or other terms of license agreements not subject to the litigation or arbitration. If there is a delay in extending, modifying or entering into a new license agreement with a licensee, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee's product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such licensees.\n\nEfforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to lower the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price on which the royalty is calculated.",

These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2024 vs. 2023\n\nQSI EBT increased in fiscal 2024 primarily due to net gains on certain of our non-marketable equity investments.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nWe believe that 5G combined with high-performance, low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence will continue to drive adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones by industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT. We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products in order to sustain and grow our business long-term.\n\nAs we look forward to the next several quarters:\n\n- We expect transitions to new generations of leading process technology nodes to continue to drive product cost increases from certain of our key semiconductor wafer suppliers.\n- We expect continued intense competition, including from vertical integration by certain of our customers (e.g., Apple).\n- Current U.S./China trade relations and/or national security protection policies may negatively impact our business, growth prospects and results of operations. See 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.'\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we ex tended, renewed or entered into license agreements with several key OEMs. We are currently pursuing negotiations with other key OEMs whose agreements expire in early fiscal 2025 (including Huawei). In addition, in fiscal 2024, we entered into a license agreement with Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Limited (a growing, China-headquartered OEM that sells primarily in developing regions) for its 5G products. While we continue to engage in negotiations toward a comprehensive resolution, we have initiated litigation against Transsion in multiple jurisdictions to enforce our intellectual property rights against certain of its unlicensed products. See 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factors titled ' The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring ' and 'The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions. '\n\nWe are also involved in other legal proceedings, including those described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Litigation is inherently uncertain, and, while we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in such matters, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless industry and governments as to the benefits of our licensing programs and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technologies and not welcome the success of our licensing programs in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. Accordingly, such companies, and/or governments or regulators, may continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.\n\nFurther discussion of risks related to our business is provided in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' included in this Annual Report.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft disclosed that Nuance had $986 million of convertible senior notes issued in 2015 and 2017, many of which were still outstanding at the time. By 2024, the majority of these notes had been redeemed, significantly reducing Microsoft's financial linkage to Nuance\u2019s pre-acquisition liabilities. This redemption reflects a strategic move to streamline Nuance\u2019s capital structure post-acquisition, aligning it more closely with Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, where the goodwill from the acquisition was assigned. The reduction in convertible debt also likely decreased Microsoft\u2019s future dilution risk and interest obligations, supporting a more integrated and controlled financial position.",

      "question": "How did Apple's minority market share in smartphones and tablets in 2023 influence third-party developers' platform prioritization, and how did Apple's 2024 changes to App Store fee structures and distribution methods aim to counteract this trend?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Apple's minority market share in smartphones and tablets made third-party developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for Apple's products, as they prioritized competing platforms like Android, Windows, and gaming consoles with larger user bases. This dynamic threatened the availability and quality of applications on Apple devices, potentially impacting customer satisfaction and product demand. In response, by 2024, Apple implemented changes to its App Store policies in both the U.S. and EU, including alternative fee structures, new distribution methods, and additional developer tools and APIs. These changes were designed to improve developer incentives and encourage greater investment in Apple's platform despite its smaller market share, thereby strengthening the ecosystem and supporting future hardware sales.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments.

The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

By 2024, this acquisition had progressed to the point where Activision Blizzard's debt instruments, previously governed under indentures with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, were transitioned to Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as evidenced by the filing of new supplemental indentures in October 2023. This shift reflects a restructuring of Activision Blizzard's financial obligations under Microsoft's ownership, with Computershare now serving as the trustee for key debt instruments, including the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026, 3.400% Senior Notes due 2027, and 4.500% Senior Notes due 2047.

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1\n\nWith  three  billion  people  actively  playing  games  today,  and  a  new  generation  steeped  in  interactive  entertainment,  Microsoft continues to invest in content, community, and cloud services. We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end,  from  the  way  games  are  created  and  distributed  to  how  they  are  played,  including  cloud  gaming  so  players  can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers, including the acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC. In January 2022, we announced  plans  to  acquire Activision  Blizzard,  Inc.,  a  leader  in  game  development  and  an  interactive  entertainment  content publisher. Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft's game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.\n\n## Our Future Opportunity\n\nThe case for digital transformation has never been more urgent. Customers are looking to us to help improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\n\n- Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.\n- Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n- Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer's behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication.\n- Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.\n- Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment.\n- Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more.\n\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n## Commitment to Sustainability\n\nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built  on  this  pledge  by  adding  commitments  to  be  water  positive  by  2030,  zero  waste  by  2030,  and  to  protect  ecosystems  by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nFiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due in substantial part to significant  global  datacenter  expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won't always be linear.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in Cisco's allowance for credit losses on loan receivables from 2023 to 2024 impact the recognition of revenue from Advanced Services, given the dependency of financing arrangements on these services?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Cisco reported an allowance for credit loss on loan receivables of $53 million as of July 29, down from $103 million as of July 30, 2022, indicating a significant reduction in expected credit losses (CSCO_10k_2023.pdf:page_84:chunk_8). These loan receivables are tied to financing arrangements for the sale of products and services, including Advanced Services (CSCO_10k_2023.pdf:page_82:chunk_3). In 2024, Cisco recognized revenue from Advanced Services as services were delivered, underlining the importance of credit quality in financing arrangements tied to service delivery (CSCO_10k_2024.pdf:page_72:chunk_1). The lower credit loss allowance in 2023 suggests improved creditworthiness of financing recipients, which may have facilitated more stable or increased delivery and recognition of Advanced Services revenue in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft positioned Enterprise Mobility + Security as a core component of Microsoft 365, which integrated security, compliance, and identity management into a unified productivity suite. This integration helped drive adoption of Azure as the underlying cloud platform, as Enterprise Mobility + Security relied on Azure's infrastructure for identity and access management, compliance, and threat protection. By 2024, Azure revenue had grown significantly, with Microsoft Cloud (including Azure) reaching $137.4 billion in fiscal year 2024, up from $91.4 billion in fiscal year 2022. This growth trajectory indicates that the strategic bundling and positioning of Enterprise Mobility + Security within Microsoft 365 in 2022 contributed to increased dependency on and usage of Azure, reinforcing its role as a foundational cloud platform for enterprise customers.",

We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\n## The Ambitions That Drive Us\n\nTo achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:\n\n- Reinvent productivity and business processes.\n- Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.\n- Create more personal computing.\n\n## Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes\n\nAt Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment. Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.\n\nOur growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and  services,  including  Office  365,  Dynamics  365,  and  LinkedIn.  Microsoft  365  brings  together  Office  365,  Windows,  and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase collaboration,  and  fuel  innovation,  all  the  while  enabling  compliance  coverage  and  data  protection.  Microsoft  Teams  is  a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience  platform  that  brings  together  communications,  knowledge,  learning,  resources,  and  insights  powered  by Microsoft  365.  Together  with  the  Microsoft  Cloud,  Dynamics  365,  Microsoft  Teams,  and  Azure  Synapse  bring  a  new  era  of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. In a dynamic labor market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired.\n\n## Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform\n\nAs  digital  transformation  accelerates,  organizations  in  every  sector  across  the  globe  can  address  challenges  that  will  have  a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. Microsoft has a proven track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets.\n\nWe continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while offering  openness,  improving  time  to  value,  reducing  costs,  and  increasing  agility.  Being  a  global-scale  cloud, Azure  uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices,  from  Internet  of  Things  ('IoT')  sensors  to  gateway  devices  and  edge  hardware  to  build,  manage,  and  secure  edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge.",

With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers.

      "question": "Cisco's 2024 10-K shows that credit loss allowances for loan receivables decreased from $103 million in fiscal year 2022 to $53 million in fiscal year 2023. Given that loan receivables in 2023 had average terms of one to three years and were primarily tied to the financing of hardware sales, how does this reduction in allowances align with the financing structure for hardware sales disclosed in Cisco's 2023 10-K?",
      "answer": "The decrease in credit loss allowances for loan receivables from $103 million in fiscal year 2022 to $53 million in fiscal year 2023 aligns with Cisco\u2019s hardware financing structure, which includes loan terms of one to three years and is directly tied to the sale of hardware. This suggests that as Cisco financed hardware sales through short-to-medium term loans in 2023, the company may have experienced either improved credit quality of financed customers or a reduction in expected defaults over the term of these receivables. The one-to-three-year term of these loan receivables implies that the 2023 allowances reflect a forward-looking assessment of credit risk for hardware sales made during that period, and the significant drop from 2022 levels indicates a strategic or market-driven shift in Cisco\u2019s credit exposure related to hardware financing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CSCO(2023) \u2192 Hardware: Cisco produced hardware in 2023, which was often financed through loan arrangements with customers.",
        "Hop 2: Hardware \u2192 Loan Receivables: These loan receivables were directly tied to the sale of hardware and had average terms of one to three years.",
        "Hop 3: Loan Receivables \u2190 CSCO(2024): In 2024, the credit loss allowance for loan receivables dropped from $103 million (FY2022) to $53 million (FY2023), indicating a change in credit risk exposure."

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft emphasized Office's integration with cloud services and enterprise security as part of its competitive strategy, distributing Office through OEMs like Dell and HP and offering Software Assurance to enhance customer retention. Office directly competed with Zoom, which was already gaining traction in videoconferencing. By 2023, Zoom had expanded its offerings to include cloud phone solutions, intensifying its threat to Microsoft's collaboration suite. In response, Microsoft sharpened its messaging around 'powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity tools' in 2023, likely leveraging Teams' deeper integration with Office 365 and Azure AI to counter Zoom's growth. This evolution shows Microsoft adapting its positioning to maintain dominance in enterprise productivity by reinforcing integration advantages in the face of Zoom's expanded product portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\nItem 1\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our  relationship  with  them  is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ('Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors' or 'ESA'). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  In  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  our  Microsoft  Store  physical  locations  and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ('LSP'), distributors, value-added resellers ('VAR'), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations.  ESAs  are  also  typically  authorized  as  LSPs  and  operate  as  resellers  for  our  other  volume  licensing  programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nWe  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized  replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.\n\n## LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations  of  various  sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,  training,  and  other  licensing  benefits  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  SA  is  included  with  certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD noted that Intel's dominance allowed it to dictate x86 microprocessor standards and benchmarks, causing AMD to face delayed access to these critical specifications, which hindered product development and go-to-market strategies. By 2024, AMD continued to report that Intel maintained control over x86 standards while also intensifying competitive pressures through aggressive practices such as rebating, exclusivity payments, and product bundling. These actions further disadvantaged AMD by limiting its market share, delaying product introductions, and compressing margins, showing that despite AMD's strategic efforts, Intel's control over x86 standards remained a persistent challenge.",

        "Hop 1: AMD(2022) \u2192 x86 Microprocessor Standards: AMD expressed concerns about Intel's control over x86 standards, which caused AMD to have delayed access to specifications, impacting product development timelines and competitiveness.",

          "chunk_text": "## Economic and Strategic Risks\n\n## Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.\n\nIntel Corporation (Intel) has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel's market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability.\n\nIntel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and  other  marketing  programs. As  a  result  of  Intel's  position  in  the  microprocessor  market,  Intel  has  been  able  to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets,  graphics  chips,  networking  devices  (wired  and  wireless),  non-volatile  storage  and  other  components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.\n\nAs  long  as  Intel  remains  in  this  dominant  position,  we  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  Intel's  business practices,  including  rebating  and  allocation  strategies  and  pricing  actions,  designed  to  limit  our  market  share  and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments  to  its  current  and  potential  customers,  retailers  and  channel  partners;  de  facto  control  over  industry standards,  and  heavy  influence  on  PC  manufacturers  and  other  PC  industry  participants,  including  motherboard, memory,  chipset  and  basic  input/output  system  (BIOS)  suppliers  and  software  companies  as  well  as  the  graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.\n\nIntel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing  and  research  and  development  than  we  do.  We  expect  Intel  to  continue  to  invest  heavily  in  marketing, research  and  development,  new  manufacturing  facilities  and  other  technology  companies.  To  the  extent  Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel's aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.\n\nIntel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including  giving  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  in  the  graphics  market,  such  as  NVIDIA  Corporation,  preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting access to external companies. Also, Intel has developed their own high-end discrete GPUs and has announced that they have developed gaming-focused discrete  graphics  that  will  be  released  in  2022.  Intel's  position  in  the  microprocessor  market,  its  introduction  of competitive  new  products,  its  existing  relationships  with  top-tier  OEMs,  and  its  aggressive  marketing  and  pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nUncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as  inflation,  interest  rates  or  recession,  may  negatively  impact  consumer  confidence  and  spending  causing  our customers  to  postpone  purchases.  In  addition,  during  challenging  economic  times,  our  current  or  potential  future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally,  if  our  customers  are  not  successful  in  generating  sufficient  revenue  or  are  unable  to  secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to  our  customers  potentially  defaulting  on  or  delaying  payments  to  us  is  increased  because  we  expect  that  a  small number  of  customers  will  continue  to  account  for  a  substantial  part  of  our  revenue. Any  inability  of  our  current  or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO's U.S. qualified pension plan allocated 100% of its assets to fixed income, primarily directed toward long-term core bond investments, with smaller allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and high-yield bonds. This strategy aimed to fully match liabilities while minimizing market and interest rate risks. In 2023, AVGO maintained the same 100% fixed income allocation, continuing to emphasize long-term core bonds as the primary component of their fixed income strategy. The consistency in allocation suggests that AVGO's risk/return profile remained stable, with no adjustments made to the target asset allocation despite periodic reviews. This reflects a sustained liability-driven investment approach, indicating AVGO saw no need to alter its pension fund risk posture between 2022 and 2023.",

Multiple investment managers are utilized, including both active and passive management approaches. The plan assets are invested using the liability-driven investment strategy intended to minimize market and interest rate risks, and those assets are periodically rebalanced toward asset allocation targets.\n\nThe target asset allocation for the U.S. qualified pension plan reflects a risk/return profile that we believe is appropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation of plan assets relative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. For both fiscal years 2022 and 2021, 100% of the U.S. qualified pension plan assets were allocated to fixed income, in line with the target allocation. The fixed income allocation is primarily directed toward longterm core bond investments, with smaller allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and high-yield bonds.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple generated $74.2 billion in net sales from the Greater China segment, which includes China Mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This geographic concentration became a risk factor in 2023 when the company disclosed that substantially all of its hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners located primarily in China Mainland. Given the contingencies section's acknowledgment of supply chain risks\u2014including potential shortages, pricing fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions\u2014the company's 2023 risk profile shows a dual exposure: high revenue dependence on a region that also hosts the majority of its manufacturing base. This increases vulnerability to disruptions from trade restrictions, labor issues, or political instability, as the same geographic region is both a major revenue source and a critical production hub.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "The reduction in Cisco's credit loss allowance for loan receivables from $103M in 2023 to $53M indicates improved credit quality or reduced exposure in financing arrangements tied to product and service sales, including technical support services. Since loan receivables are explicitly used to finance the sale of technical support and advanced services (as stated in the 2024 filing), this reduction suggests either tighter credit standards, better repayment performance, or both in the financing of these service offerings. This would likely result in a more favorable financing structure for technical support services in 2024, with lower risk and potentially more favorable terms for Cisco.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Note  2  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\n\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software  licenses  are  distinct  performance  obligations  where  revenue  is  recognized  upfront  upon  transfer  of  control.  Term  software  licenses  include  multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\n\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n\nWe  assess  relevant  contractual  terms  in  our  customer  contracts  to  determine  the  transaction  price.  We  apply  judgment  in  identifying  contractual  terms  and determining  the  transaction  price  as  we  may  be  required  to  estimate  variable  consideration  when  determining  the  amount  of  revenue  to  recognize.  V ariable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n\n## Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\n\nInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales.

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco maintained a $10.0 billion commercial paper program, with $0.6 billion outstanding as of July 30, 2022, indicating a conservative use of short-term debt. The senior fixed-rate notes were redeemable at any time with a make-whole premium and ranked at par with commercial paper notes, creating a structured capital hierarchy. In 2023, Cisco issued $13.5 billion in new senior notes, likely leveraging the flexibility provided by the redemption terms of existing notes and the stable short-term debt position to support long-term financing needs. This strategic shift suggests a move toward longer-term capital structure optimization.",

We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.",

The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDue to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, ex port and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company's ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.\n\nThe Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flex ibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.\n\nIneffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nThe Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' In addition, as discussed in note Q, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.\n\nThe Company's Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and ex perienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the",

      "answer": "In 2023, Cisco (CSCO) used significant unobservable inputs such as projected future revenues, expenses, attrition rates for customer contracts, and technology obsolescence rates in valuing customer contracts and technology assets acquired from Splunk, with specialized professionals assisting in evaluating the appropriateness of income approach methods and discount rate assumptions. By 2024, Cisco continued to rely on unobservable inputs for fair value estimation, particularly for non-marketable equity securities and purchased intangible assets categorized under Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, but expanded the types of inputs to include volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities held. The MET_10k_2023 chunk confirms that valuation methodologies involving unobservable inputs can materially affect estimated fair value, which contextualizes Cisco\u2019s continued reliance on judgment and assumptions in its evolving fair value estimation practices.",

        "Hop 2: Fair Value Estimation \u2192 Valuation Methods: Considerable judgment is required in developing fair value estimates, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies can materially affect the estimated fair value, as noted in the MET_10k_2023 evidence.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did Apple's $19.4 billion in unrecognized RSU compensation costs from 2023 influence its ability to negotiate favorable terms with third-party content providers in 2024, given the company's explicit dependence on licensing agreements and rising content production costs?",
      "answer": "Apple's $19.4 billion in unrecognized RSU compensation costs from 2023 (to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years) created significant financial obligations that likely constrained its flexibility in 2024 when negotiating with third-party content providers. This is particularly relevant given Apple's explicit dependence on third-party developers and content providers for maintaining the value of its ecosystem and attracting customers. In 2024, Apple acknowledged increasing difficulty in securing content on commercially reasonable terms, with providers either raising costs or limiting access. The combination of long-term financial commitments like RSUs and rising content licensing costs likely reduced Apple\u2019s bargaining power, especially as some content providers operate competing platforms and may leverage their position to demand higher fees or restrict availability. This financial pressure coincided with Apple's own rising internal content production costs due to competition for talent and subscriber growth, further straining its ability to absorb higher licensing fees.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If  third-party  software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relativ e benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and X box for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the A pp Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the A pp Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within  an  application.  From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS A pp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the A pp Store and Safari in the European Union ('EU') as it seeks to comply with the Digital M arkets A ct (the 'DM A '), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced A pp Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. \u00ae\n\n## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relativ ely  short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If  third-party  software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relativ e benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and X box for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the A pp Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the A pp Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within  an  application.  From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS A pp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the A pp Store and Safari in the European Union ('EU') as it seeks to comply with the Digital M arkets A ct (the 'DM A '), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced A pp Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. \u00ae\n\n## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relativ ely  short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world's first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn's free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing  Solutions,  Premium  Subscriptions,  and  Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies  reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their  professional  identity,  grow  their  network,  and  connect  with  talent  through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital  selling  tools,  and  acquire  new  opportunities.  LinkedIn  has  over  850  million  members  and  has  offices  around  the  globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\n## Dynamics\n\nDynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource  planning ('ERP'), customer relationship management ('CRM'), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint,  Slack,  Symantec,  Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications  equipment  to  grow  its  unified communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.  Slack  provides  teamwork  and collaboration  software.  Zoom  offers  videoconferencing  and  cloud  phone  solutions.  Okta,  Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and  governance.  Web-based  offerings  competing  with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.",

      "answer": "Apple reported $74.2 billion in net sales from the Greater China region in 2022, showing strong market performance. However, this growth contrasts with the 2023 10-K filing highlighting that 'substantially all of Apple's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland,' signaling a high operational dependency on a single geographic area. This creates a strategic tension where Apple benefits from strong consumer demand in the Greater China region, yet faces potential risks from overreliance on manufacturing partners in China Mainland, especially amid geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain disruptions. The juxtaposition suggests Apple may need to balance market expansion in Greater China with efforts to diversify its manufacturing footprint to mitigate risk.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple acknowledged that some third-party digital content providers required the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions, and that if these requirements changed, Apple may have to develop or license new technology to meet them, with no assurance of being able to do so at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. By 2024, Apple reported that third-party content providers were actively making it 'difficult or impossible' for Apple to license or distribute their content, and that other providers were seeking to limit access or increase costs. This indicates that as Apple's digital rights management needs evolved, it faced increasing challenges in maintaining favorable licensing arrangements, especially as some providers began to act strategically against Apple\u2019s distribution capabilities. The 2024 filings also noted that licensing arrangements were often for short time periods and did not guarantee continuation or renewal on commercially reasonable terms, which contrasts with the 2022 expectation that DRM compliance would support stable content partnerships.",

There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n\nThe  Company  believes  the  availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services  for  its  products  depends  in  part  on  the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading  software  for  competitors'  products  with  larger  market  share.  When  developers  focus  their  efforts  on  these  competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe  Company  relies  on  the  continued  availability  and  development  of  compelling  and  innovative  software  applications  for  its products.  The  Company's  products  and  operating  systems  are  subject  to  rapid  technological  change,  and  when  third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.\n\nThe  Company  distributes  third-party  applications  for  its  products  through  the  App  Store.  For  the  vast  majority  of  applications, developers  keep  all  of  the  revenue  they  generate  on  the  App  Store.  The  Company  only  retains  a  commission  from  sales  of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App  Store,  including  actions  taken  in  response  to  competition,  market  and  legal  conditions.  The  Company  may  make  further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union ('EU') Digital Markets Act, could require further  changes.  The  Company  is  also  subject  to  litigation  and  investigations  relating  to  the  App  Store,  which  have  resulted  in changes to the Company's business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions  to,  third-party  content,  as  well  as  the  right  to  incorporate  specific  content  into  the  Company's  own  services.  The licensing  or  other  distribution  arrangements  for  this  content  can  be  for  relatively  short  time  periods  and  do  not  guarantee  the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors  currently  or  in  the  future  may  offer  competing  products  and  services,  and  can  take  actions  to  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent,  content  and  subscribers,  and  may fail  to  appeal  to  the  Company's  customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's reliance on Chinese OEMs in 2022 relate to its investment in integrated circuit product inventory obligations by 2023, and what does this suggest about its strategic positioning in the face of potential customer vertical integration?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm identified Chinese OEMs as a critical revenue driver, with a significant portion of its business tied to these companies, especially in light of the Chinese government\u2019s Made in China 2025 campaign encouraging semiconductor self-sufficiency. This created a risk of customer vertical integration, where OEMs might develop their own integrated circuits, threatening Qualcomm\u2019s market position. Despite this risk, by 2023, Qualcomm had increased its commitment to integrated circuit production, with $12.8 billion in total inventory obligations, including $9.6 billion expected to be paid in the next 12 months. This suggests that Qualcomm doubled down on its semiconductor strategy, likely to maintain competitive positioning and supply chain control, even as the risk of OEMs developing their own chips persisted.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' References to 'and,' 'or' and 'and/or' should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies - Concentrations.'\n\nIn addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products) .'\n\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand, elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), or a shift in share away",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

      "answer": "In 2022, CSCO had $9.0 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding, which were linked to commercial paper notes as part of their broader debt structure. By 2023, CSCO expanded their short-term debt financing program to allow for up to $15.0 billion in commercial paper notes issuance. This significant increase in capacity suggests a strategic shift toward more flexible short-term financing options, potentially to support general corporate purposes while managing interest rate exposure on fixed-rate debt. The prior year's disclosure of the senior notes ranking at par with future commercial paper notes indicates that this evolution was a planned progression in their capital structure management.",

The carrying amount of the  senior  notes  was  $8.9  billion,  and  the  related  fair  value  based  on  market  prices  was  $9.7  billion.  As  of  July  30,  2022,  a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $1.5  billion  of  hedged  debt,  by  a  decrease  or  increase  of  approximately  $0.3  billion,  respectively.

Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies.

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco reported total loan receivables of $2.23 billion, which included financing arrangements across a range of credit ratings and terms. By 2023, the company's disclosures clarified that loan receivables were primarily tied to the sale of hardware, software, and services, with specific mention that these arrangements often included funding for network installation and integration of Cisco products. This indicates a strategic shift toward using loan receivables more directly to support hardware deployments. The 2023 language also emphasized that loan receivables had average terms of one to three years, suggesting a more targeted and time-bound financing strategy compared to the broader credit extension seen in 2022.",

By 2024, the company expanded its hedging program, increasing the notional amount of foreign exchange cash flow hedges from $8.3 billion in 2023 to $9.9 billion, indicating a more aggressive stance in managing currency risk. Additionally, Adobe's hedging policy now covers forecasted transactions for periods up to four years, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer-term exposure management.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nlocal currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $749 million and $598 million, respectively, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue\n\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros,  British  Pounds,  Japanese  Yen  and Australian  Dollars.  We  hedge  these  cash  flow  exposures  to  reduce  the  risk  that  our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\n\nWe record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue in accumulated other comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  until  the  forecasted  transaction  occurs.  When  the  forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue. For the fiscal year ended December 3, 2021, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\n\n## Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\n\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At December 3, 2021, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.\n\nSee  Note  6  of  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  information  regarding  our  derivative  financial instruments.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\n## Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities\n\nAt December 3, 2021, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.95 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 3, 2021, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a $27 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $14 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nAs of December 3, 2021, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore do not  subject  us  to  financial  statement  risk  associated  with  changes  in  interest  rates. As  of  December  3,  2021,  the  total  carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.12 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $4.29 billion.\n\nSee Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

      "question": "How did CRM's strategic response to AI regulatory risks in 2024 evolve from its 2023 acknowledgment of AI technology risks, particularly in light of new regulations like DORA going into effect in January 2025?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CRM identified AI technology as a key risk factor, noting uncertainties around integrating AI into product offerings and the potential impact of evolving domestic and foreign regulations (CRM_10k_2023.pdf:page_4:chunk_2). By 2024, CRM's response to these risks had evolved into a more structured compliance strategy, particularly in anticipation of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which went into effect in January 2025 and imposed mandatory risk management and third-party outsourcing restrictions (CRM_10k_2024.pdf:page_24:chunk_1). This evolution reflects CRM's recognition of the GS_2024-described regulatory complexity around AI, including the need for transparency, bias mitigation, and third-party oversight (GS_10k_2024.pdf:page_46:chunk_1). CRM's 2024 filings indicate a shift from general risk awareness to proactive compliance planning, including increased resource allocation to meet industry-specific controls and customer expectations for regulatory alignment.",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. For example, in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch citizens that claims we violated the GDPR and Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our Audience Studio and Data Studio products. In December 2021, the Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective's claims against us inadmissible and dismissed the case, however, this ruling was appealed by the Privacy Collective. The appeal hearing took place in the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in February 2024 and the appellate court reversed the district court's judgment. We have appealed that appellate decision to the Dutch Supreme Court. We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK, which has subsequently been dismissed. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. In addition, a shift in consumers' data privacy expectations or other social, economic or political developments could impact the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and increase the cost of compliance with the imposed regulations.\n\nFurthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. In addition, new products we develop or acquire in connection with changing events may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\n\n## Industry-specific regulations and other requirements and standards are evolving and industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.\n\nOur customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing, AI services and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may ex pect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Any inability in the future to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers may harm our business and adversely affect our results.\n\nFurther, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized 'in country,' as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. This is also true with respect to the global proliferation of laws regulating the financial services industry, including its use of cloud services. In Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience Act ('DORA'), which aims to ensure the resilience of the EU financial sectors, including through mandatory risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and third-party outsourcing restrictions, went into effect in January 2025. The UK is advancing similar legislation and other countries may follow.\n\nFurther, countries and states are applying their data and consumer protection laws to AI, and particularly generative AI, and/or are enacting or considering legal frameworks on AI, such as the Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act and the draft CCPA regulations on automated decision-making technology. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's exposure to the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 evolve after acquiring Activision Blizzard, particularly in light of Activision issuing supplemental indentures related to these notes in October 2023 and Microsoft excluding Activision\u2019s internal controls from its 2024 financial reporting?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Microsoft introduced the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026 through a supplemental indenture, indicating its growing involvement with the debt instrument. By October 2023, Activision Blizzard issued a First Supplemental Indenture related to these notes, signaling that the obligation was now under its corporate structure. Following Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard on October 13, 2023, the company took a stake in Activision, whose financials\u2014including the 3.400% Senior Notes due 2026\u2014were consolidated into Microsoft\u2019s financial structure. However, in its 2024 financial reporting, Microsoft excluded Activision\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting, citing that Activision\u2019s financial statements constituted less than 1% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and 2% of total revenues. This suggests that while Microsoft assumed exposure to the notes, it maintained a cautious approach to integrating Activision\u2019s financial controls, potentially impacting the risk profile and oversight of these debt obligations.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total rev enues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control ov er financial reporting at Activ ision Blizzard, Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiv eness of internal control ov er financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control ov er Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control ov er financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effectiv e internal control ov er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control ov er financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and ev aluating the design and operating effectiv eness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believ e that our audit prov ides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control ov er financial reporting is a process designed to prov ide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

      "question": "How did Microsoft's positioning of Office in 2022 as a comprehensive productivity suite evolve by 2024 in response to Meta's explicit emergence as a provider of communication tools for enterprise productivity, and what does this reveal about Microsoft's shifting competitive strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft positioned Office as a core component of its OEM and enterprise distribution model, emphasizing its integration with Windows and the broader Microsoft ecosystem, including cloud services like Office 365. Office was framed as a flexible, secure, and integrated productivity suite competing against a broad set of vendors including Apple, Google, and Slack. However, by 2024, Microsoft explicitly called out Meta as a direct competitor in the Office product line, noting that Meta now offers 'communication tools to enable productivity and engagement within organizations.' This marks a strategic shift where Microsoft is now directly countering Meta's enterprise ambitions, suggesting a recalibration of its competitive focus to include social and collaboration platforms as part of the productivity stack. The evolution from a general competitive framing in 2022 to a specific mention of Meta in 2024 reflects Microsoft\u2019s recognition of Meta\u2019s growing influence in enterprise communication tools and its potential to disrupt traditional productivity software markets.",
