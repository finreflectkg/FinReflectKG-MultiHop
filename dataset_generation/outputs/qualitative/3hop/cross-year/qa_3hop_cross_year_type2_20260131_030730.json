      "question": "How did Texas Instruments' strategic emphasis on embedded processing products evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this 3-year progression indicate about the company's long-term positioning in the semiconductor industry?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Texas Instruments (TXN) consistently emphasized embedded processing products as a core pillar of its business model, highlighting them in each year's 10-K filing as central to its four sustainable competitive advantages. In 2022, embedded processing was described as a key part of the company's broad product portfolio, offering more opportunity per customer and greater value on investments. This focus remained unchanged in 2023, with the same language used to describe the competitive advantage derived from embedded processing products. By 2024, the company continued to reinforce this strategic direction, maintaining that embedded processing contributes to its unique positioning in the semiconductor market by supporting customer diversity, channel reach, and long-term investment returns. The consistent emphasis across all three years indicates a stable, long-term strategy centered on embedded processing as a foundational element for generating free cash flow and maintaining competitive differentiation.",

        "Hop 1: [TXN](2022) \u2192 [Embedded Processing Products]: Embedded processing products are described as a core component of the company\u2019s business model and competitive advantages, particularly in expanding customer opportunity and investment value.",
        "Hop 2: [TXN](2023) \u2192 [Embedded Processing Products]: The strategic importance of embedded processing is reaffirmed, with identical language used to describe its role in delivering per-customer value and supporting long-term capital allocation decisions.",
        "Hop 3: [TXN](2024) \u2192 [Embedded Processing Products]: Embedded processing remains a central theme in the company\u2019s strategy, with continued emphasis on its role in enabling TI to maintain a unique competitive position in the semiconductor industry."

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.\n\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:\n- i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n- ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.\n- iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n- iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.\n\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares and 7 million shares valued at $1.16 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in both 2021 and 2020 were $27 million. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $63 million in 2021 and $61 million in 2020 and 2019.",

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching sav ings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to v arious inv estment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are prov ided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after Nov ember 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan prov ides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receiv e the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 5 million shares in both periods v alued at $852 million and $873 million, respectiv ely. Div idends paid on these shares in 2024 and 2023 were $26 million and $27 million, respectiv ely. Effectiv e April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $76 million, $75 million and $70 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue serv ice-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of serv ice and the highest fiv e consecutiv e years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants.",

      "question": "How did Texas Instruments' (TXN) operational footprint in Melaka, Malaysia evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this 3-year progression reveal about the company's focus on analog versus embedded processing in that location?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Texas Instruments maintained its operational presence in Melaka, Malaysia, consistently focusing solely on analog product lines without expanding into embedded processing. In 2022, Melaka was listed with an 'X' under Analog but not under Embedded Processing. This pattern remained unchanged in 2023 and 2024, indicating a stable, analog-only operational strategy in Melaka throughout the three-year period. This consistency suggests a targeted investment in analog capabilities rather than a diversification into embedded processing in that location.",

      "question": "How did the relative importance of the PC & Notebooks segment within Texas Instruments' Personal Electronics market evolve from 2022 to 2024, based on its revenue contribution and product composition across those years?",
      "answer": "The importance of the PC & Notebooks segment within Texas Instruments' Personal Electronics market declined from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, Personal Electronics accounted for 24% of TI revenue, with PC & Notebooks listed among several subcategories. By 2023, the Personal Electronics segment had dropped to 15% of TI revenue, and in 2024, it rebounded slightly to 20% of revenue. Despite this partial recovery, the 2024 listing of PC & Notebooks was included alongside a growing number of other product categories, suggesting a diluted focus on PCs relative to other electronics. This indicates a downward trend in the strategic emphasis on PC & Notebooks over the three-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [TXN](2022) \u2192 [PC & Notebooks]: PC & Notebooks was part of the Personal Electronics segment, which represented 24% of TI revenue in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: [TXN](2023) \u2192 [PC & Notebooks]: In 2023, the Personal Electronics segment dropped to 15% of TI revenue, with PC & Notebooks still listed as a key component.",
        "Hop 3: [TXN](2024) \u2192 [PC & Notebooks]: By 2024, the Personal Electronics segment rose to 20% of TI revenue, but PC & Notebooks was listed among a broader set of product categories, indicating a less concentrated focus."

      "answer": "Texas Instruments has consistently emphasized embedded processing products as a core component of its business model across 2022, 2023, and 2024, framing them as a key driver in achieving long-term growth in free cash flow per share. In 2022, the company highlighted the tangible benefits of its four competitive advantages, including a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offer more opportunity per customer and more value for investments. In 2023, TI reiterated this strategic focus, underscoring that embedded processing products are central to its unique business model and long-term investment decisions. In 2024, the company maintained this narrative, emphasizing that embedded processing products continue to be foundational in leveraging its competitive advantages and guiding capital allocation. This consistent emphasis reveals that TI views embedded processing as a stable, high-margin, and scalable segment that supports its long-term objective of maximizing free cash flow per share.",

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching sav ings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to v arious inv estment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are prov ided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after Nov ember 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan prov ides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receiv e the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 5 million shares in both periods v alued at $852 million and $873 million, respectiv ely. Div idends paid on these shares in 2024 and 2023 were $26 million and $27 million, respectiv ely. Effectiv e April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $76 million, $75 million and $70 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue serv ice-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of serv ice and the highest fiv e consecutiv e years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants.",

      "answer": "Texas Instruments maintained its operational presence in Melaka, Malaysia consistently across all three years, specifically focused on analog product lines. In 2022, Melaka was explicitly marked as engaged in analog operations (with a checkmark), but not in embedded processing. This pattern remained unchanged in 2023 and 2024, where Melaka continued to be listed exclusively under analog operations. There was no expansion into embedded processing in Melaka over the three-year period, indicating a stable, specialized role in TI's global manufacturing footprint.",

This consistent reduction over the three-year period indicates that Texas Instruments has been actively utilizing the plan for director compensation, gradually depleting the available share pool. The trend suggests a sustained reliance on this plan as part of the company's executive and director incentive strategy.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Cisco reported an effective interest rate of 3.20% on the $500 million 3.50% Senior Note maturing in June 2025. By fiscal year 2023, the effective rate on this same note had increased to 6.38%, and in fiscal year 2024, it further rose to 6.66%. This indicates a significant increase in Cisco's borrowing costs on this instrument over the three-year period, reflecting either market rate increases or shifts in investor risk perception.",

      "question": "How did Cisco's financial exposure through total return swaps linked to deferred compensation evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of realized gains or losses, and what does this progression indicate about the company's risk management or compensation strategy?",
      "answer": "Cisco's financial exposure through total return swaps tied to deferred compensation shifted significantly across the three-year period. In fiscal 2022, the company reported a loss of $92 million related to these swaps. By fiscal 2023, this position improved to a gain of $58 million, and in fiscal 2024, the gain increased further to $91 million. This progression indicates a notable turnaround in the performance of these instruments, potentially reflecting improved market conditions or strategic adjustments in Cisco's deferred compensation design or hedging practices.",

      "question": "How did Cisco's utilization of its 5.90% Note evolve from fiscal year 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its total debt composition and effective interest rate, and what does this indicate about the company's long-term financing strategy?",
      "answer": "Cisco's utilization of its 5.90% Note remained consistent at $2,000 million across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, with the effective interest rate holding steady at 6.11% throughout the period. However, the composition of Cisco's total debt changed significantly \u2014 total long-term debt increased from $8,416 million in 2022 to $19,621 million in 2024, while short-term debt decreased from $499 million to $488 million. This indicates that Cisco has been increasingly relying on long-term fixed-rate instruments, including the 5.90% Note, as part of a broader strategy to stabilize financing costs amid rising debt levels.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CSCO](2022) \u2192 [5.90% Note]: Cisco disclosed $2,000 million outstanding for the 5.90% Note with an effective rate of 6.11%, forming part of $8,915 million total debt.",
        "Hop 2: [CSCO](2023) \u2192 [5.90% Note]: Cisco maintained the same $2,000 million amount for the 5.90% Note at the same 6.11% effective rate, now within a larger total debt structure of $20,109 million.",
        "Hop 3: [CSCO](2024) \u2192 [5.90% Note]: Cisco continued to report the 5.90% Note at $2,000 million with a 6.11% effective rate, as total debt reached $20,109 million, showing strategic consistency in leveraging this instrument."

      "question": "How did the performance of Cisco's available-for-sale debt investments impact other income (loss), net across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this three-year trend indicate about the volatility of these investments?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco disclosed its available-for-sale debt investments in detail, setting the baseline for these assets. In fiscal 2023, the company reported higher losses in these investments, contributing negatively to the 'other income (loss), net' line item. This negative impact persisted into fiscal 2024, where again, higher losses in available-for-sale debt investments were cited as a primary driver of the change in 'other income (loss), net,' despite partial offsets from equity investments and privately held investments. This three-year pattern reveals a consistent downward pressure from AFS debt holdings, indicating a trend of increasing volatility and risk associated with these investments over time.",

      "answer": "Cisco's approach to pay equity has evolved significantly from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024. In 2022, Cisco introduced an innovative and inclusive analytics framework to evaluate its compensation system and test for pay parity, aiming to correct gaps when found. By 2023, the company expanded its pay parity program beyond base salary to include additional forms of compensation such as promotions, bonuses, and stock decisions, ensuring the program addressed all employees across the full spectrum of diversity. In 2024, Cisco maintained this expanded scope and continued to refine its analytics-driven approach, emphasizing global self-reported data collection to support fairness across all forms of compensation. This progression indicates a deepening commitment to comprehensive pay equity, moving from foundational parity checks to a more holistic, data-informed strategy.",

We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, orientation, ability, nationality and background - the foundation of our Conscious Culture.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performancebased compensation aligned with each employee's contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions.\n\nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signer of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and we are leading the charge to make fair pay a reality for all employees through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium. We have also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\n\n## Health &amp; Well-being\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We provide our employees and their families high-quality, flexible and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal lives, all while managing their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We developed a COVID-19 response and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health. In fiscal 2022, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We have moved towards a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe believe in open-ended, self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need to succeed. We encourage employees to explore assignments outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work. Employees choose their own career paths and we support that choice by providing them with tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nWe believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes regular, virtual all hands, which we refer to as a 'Cisco Check-In,' and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a 'Team Space Check-In.' Our regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cisco Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from business updates to social justice to physical and mental health.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we have seen high level of employee engagement. For example, there were approximately 2.1 million Team Space Check-Ins  by  our  employees  in  fiscal  2022,  reflecting  87%  of  employees  submitting  Team  Space  Check-Ins.  Employees  also participate  in  our  global  Engagement  Pulse  Survey  and  the  Real  Deal  Survey.  These  surveys  allow  our  employees  to  provide confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.\n\n## Purpose Report\n\nAdditional information regarding Cisco's ESG initiatives and our people, as well as our workforce diversity data, can be found in our Purpose Report and related supplemental information, which are located on our ESG Reporting Hub at https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en\\_us/about/csr/esg-hub.html.

The CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity - including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, ex perience, strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: As of July 27, 2024, 36% of our Ex ecutive Leadership Team (EL T) are women and 43% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity.\n\nWe publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2023 data, our global employee base was comprised of 29% women, 71% men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 48.2% White/Caucasian, 33.5% Asian, 6.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5.6% African American/Black, 2.0% two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino), 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 3.7% prefer to not to disclose/unknown.\n\nWith respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our positive impact. We have published our Social Justice Beliefs &amp; Actions, which is our blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background which is the foundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office helps drive accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and suppliers.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent.

We offer mindfulness courses, employee assistance program offerings, and out-of-network provider benefits for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more.

We also know that the world of work will continue to rapidly evolve, requiring new skillsets. At Cisco, we believe that your career is owned by you, supported by your leader, and enabled by Cisco. Cisco believes in open-ended self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows best what skills and resources they need to succeed. This means that while each employee has the power to shape their career on their own terms, they also have a supportive ecosystem to develop the skills they need to succeed both today and tomorrow.

This language remained consistent in 2023 and 2024, with identical phrasing used each year to describe the value derived from the product portfolio.

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.\n\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:\n- i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n- ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.\n- iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n- iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.\n\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.

      "question": "How has Texas Instruments' funding approach and expense trajectory for its non-qualified defined benefit pension plan evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's long-term liability management strategy for legacy retirement obligations?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Texas Instruments maintained a consistent funding strategy for its non-qualified defined benefit pension plan, stating that it intends to meet minimum funding requirements and contribute additional amounts as deemed appropriate. The company's aggregate expense for U.S. defined contribution plans, which are closely tied to pension plan dynamics, increased steadily from $70 million in 2022 to $75 million in 2023, and further to $76 million in 2024. This upward trend in expenses reflects a growing financial commitment to retirement benefits, even as the defined benefit pension plans remain closed to new participants and the non-qualified plans remain unfunded. The company's approach suggests a measured but increasing focus on managing legacy liabilities while balancing current employee benefits.",

Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.

      "question": "How did Texas Instruments' (TXN) operational footprint in Melaka, Malaysia evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, specifically in terms of its involvement in Analog and Embedded Processing business segments over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments operated in Melaka, Malaysia exclusively for its Analog business, with no involvement in Embedded Processing. This remained unchanged in 2023, where Melaka continued to support only the Analog segment. By 2024, the operational focus in Melaka remained solely on Analog, with no indication of expansion into Embedded Processing. This 3-year consistency highlights a stable, specialized role for Melaka within TXN's global operations, centered exclusively on Analog product development and manufacturing.",

      "question": "How did the relative revenue contribution of PC & Notebooks within Texas Instruments' Personal Electronics segment evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this 3-year trajectory suggest about the company's positioning in the computing hardware market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Personal Electronics accounted for 24% of TI's revenue with PC & Notebooks listed as a key subcategory. By 2023, the Personal Electronics segment had declined to 15% of total revenue, indicating a significant contraction in this market for TI. In 2024, the segment rebounded slightly to 20% of revenue, with PC & Notebooks still included in the product mix. This 3-year trajectory shows a volatile trend with a net decline in the segment's contribution, suggesting TI may be strategically reducing its exposure to more commoditized consumer computing markets in favor of industrial and automotive applications.",

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's valuation and treatment of its 3.50% Notes Due 2040 evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year trajectory reveal about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA reported the fair value of its 3.50% Notes Due 2040 at $1,066 million. By fiscal year 2023, this value had decreased to $851 million, indicating a reduction in the liability's fair value.

      "answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA reported a fair value of $1.2 billion for the 2.00% Notes Due 2031. By 2023, this amount slightly increased to $1.044 billion at the beginning of the year, and then remained stable at $1.057 billion by the end of the year. In 2024, the carrying value of the 2.00% Notes Due 2031 was $1.25 billion, with no short-term portion, indicating a consistent long-term debt position. This shows a relatively stable approach to this particular long-term liability, suggesting strategic consistency in managing this component of its capital structure.",

      "question": "How has the competitive positioning of Lumentum Holdings in NVIDIA\u2019s disclosed competitor landscape evolved from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to NVIDIA\u2019s expanding supply chain and IP protection strategies?",
      "answer": "Lumentum Holdings remained consistently positioned as a competitor to NVIDIA across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, specifically in the domain of networking products such as optical modules and interconnect solutions. In 2022, NVIDIA highlighted its competitive environment, listing Lumentum Holdings among suppliers of interconnect, switch, and cable solutions. By 2023, NVIDIA reiterated this competitive relationship, placing Lumentum in the broader context of increased competition from companies offering semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products. In 2024, NVIDIA again named Lumentum Holdings Inc. as a competitor, while emphasizing its own strategic moves to strengthen supply chain resilience and expand IP protection. The consistent mention of Lumentum across three years indicates that it remains a persistent competitive force, even as NVIDIA enhances its manufacturing partnerships (e.g., with TSMC, Samsung) and extends its patent portfolio (with expiration dates moving from 2022 to 2045 across the years). This suggests that despite NVIDIA\u2019s strategic supply chain and IP advancements, Lumentum has maintained its relevance in the competitive landscape.",

        "Hop 3: NVDA(2024) \u2192 Lumentum Holdings: Again named as a competitor in networking products, while NVIDIA emphasized supply chain expansion and long-term patent protection (patents expiring through 2045)."

We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers  and  licensors  designing  discrete  and  integrated  GPUs,  custom  chips  and  other  accelerated computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\n- suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc.,  AMD,  Broadcom  Inc., Intel, Qualcomm  Incorporated, Renesas  Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\n- suppliers  of  interconnect,  switch  and  cable  solutions  such  as  AMD,  Applied  Optoelectronics,  Inc.,  Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe  rely  primarily  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  employee  and  third-party  nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;\n- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n- the  commercial  significance  of  our  operations  and  our  competitors'  operations  in  particular  countries  and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for a discussion of these potential impacts.",

Our  supply  chain  is  mainly  concentrated  in  the  A sia-Pacific  region.  We  utilize  foundries,  such  as  T aiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSM C, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix Inc., M icron T echnology , Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly , testing and packaging of our final products.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,  conformity  to  industry  standard A PIs,  manufacturing  capabilities,  processor  pricing,  and  total  system  costs.  W e  believe  that  our  ability   to  remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver  consistent  volumes  of  our  products  at  acceptable  levels  of  quality   and  at  competitiv e  prices.  W e  ex pect  competition  to  increase  from  both  ex isting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\n\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for A I, such as A dv anced M icro Devices, Inc., or A M D, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or A I computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as A libaba Group, A lphabet Inc., A mazon, Inc., or A mazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and M icrosoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\n- suppliers of A rm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and M icrosoft;\n- suppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as A mbarella, Inc., A M D, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\n- networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical modules) include such as A M D, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company , Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and M arvell T echnology , Inc. as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally . Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP . The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in A sia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely .

      "question": "How did AMD's revenue recognition policy for development and IP licensing agreements evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly regarding the distinction between combined arrangements and standalone licenses, and what does this reveal about the consistency of AMD's accounting approach for these agreements?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD maintained a consistent revenue recognition policy for development and IP licensing agreements. In all three years, the company evaluated whether the licensing component in combined arrangements was distinct based on whether it was (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license was not distinct, it was combined with development services and recognized over time; if distinct, revenue was recognized at a point in time. Additionally, for standalone IP arrangements, revenue was consistently recognized at a point in time when the customer could benefit from the license. There were no variable consideration estimates associated with these arrangements in any of the years, indicating a stable and uniform accounting policy across the period.",

The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company's satisfaction of its performance obligation.\n\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n## Development and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  the  Company  may  enter  into  arrangements  with  customers  that  combine  the  provision  of development services and a license to the right to use the Company's IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or  multiple  performance  obligations  based  upon  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  Revenue  is  recognized  upon  the transfer  of  control,  over  time  or  at  a  point  in  time,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  The  Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct  and  (ii)  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  arrangement.  If  the  license  is  not  distinct,  it  is  combined  with  the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its  patents  or  IP .  Generally,  there  are  no  performance  obligations  beyond  transferring  the  designated  license  to  the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company's standard contractual terms, which  are  typically  net  30  to  60  days.  The  Company  has  determined  that  it  does  not  have  significant  financing components in its contracts with customers.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions  about future demand  and  market  conditions. In determining excess  or obsolescence  reserves  for  its  products,  the  Company  considers  assumptions  such  as  changes  in  business  and economic  conditions,  other-than-temporary  decreases  in  demand  for  its  products,  and  changes  in  technology  or customer  requirements.  In  determining  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value  reserves,  the  Company  considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company  fully  reserves  for  inventories  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  for  inventory  deemed  obsolete.  The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  to  anticipated  usage  using  recent  historical  activity  as  well  as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.",

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to the risk of losing tax and tariff exemptions evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression suggest about the company's increasing reliance on international operations and geopolitical sensitivity?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD highlighted the risk of losing tax and tariff exemptions as part of its broader exposure to international regulatory changes, noting that such a loss could increase costs and disrupt business. By 2023, the company reiterated this risk and expanded on the geopolitical tensions, particularly between China and Taiwan, which could materially affect its third-party manufacturing partners. In 2024, AMD not only maintained this concern but also emphasized the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical instability, including sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict and the potential disruption of Taiwan-based manufacturing. The consistent mention of this risk across all three years, with increasing emphasis on geopolitical sensitivity and international dependencies, indicates a growing concern over the potential loss of tax and tariff exemptions as AMD's global footprint and reliance on international supply chains have expanded.",

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.  The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.",

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Customers\n\nOur  microprocessor  customers  consist  primarily  of  original  equipment  manufacturers  (OEMs),  large  public  cloud service  providers,  original  design  manufacturers  (ODMs),  system  integrators  and  independent  distributors  in  both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).\n\nCustomers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers' needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers' time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.\n\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\n\nTwo customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe  focus  on  three  types  of  OEM  partners:  multi-nationals,  selected  regional  accounts  and  some  local  system integrators,  who  target  commercial  and  consumer  end  customers  of  all  sizes.  Large  multi-nationals  and  regional accounts  are  the  core  of  our  OEM  partners'  business;  however,  we  are  increasingly  focused  on  the  Value  Added Reseller  (VAR)  channel  which  resells  OEM  systems  to  the  mid-market  and  the  small  and  medium  business  (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with  their  software  and  services  solutions  into  Enterprise,  HPC  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  Customers.  Our  OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors  handle  a  wide  variety  of  products,  and  may  include  those  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our  agreements  with  distributors  protect  their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements  with  our  distributors  may  contain  standard  stock  rotation  provisions  permitting  limited  levels  of  product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.",

Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.

We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

      "answer": "AMD consistently referenced the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan in its filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024 without introducing any amendments or new disclosures about the plan itself. In 2022, the plan was listed as Exhibit 10.1 and was described as filed on April 2, 2011. In 2023 and 2024, the same description and reference were maintained, indicating no changes to the plan were made during this period.

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to its expanding global operations and international sales percentages, and what does this trend suggest about increasing complexity in managing IP risks in foreign jurisdictions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD highlighted difficulties in protecting intellectual property as part of a broader set of international operational risks, including staffing and regulatory challenges. By 2023, international sales accounted for 65% of net revenue, with AMD explicitly linking IP protection challenges to geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan, which could disrupt manufacturing and materially affect delivery. In 2024, AMD reiterated these IP risks but now in the context of even higher international sales (66% of net revenue) and recent regulatory changes due to global conflicts, such as sanctions against Russia and Belarus. This progression shows a growing exposure to IP protection difficulties as AMD's global footprint and international revenue concentration expanded, suggesting an increasing complexity in managing IP risk in foreign jurisdictions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AMD](2022) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD cited IP protection challenges among a list of foreign operational risks, including staffing and regulatory issues, but did not emphasize specific geopolitical factors.",
        "Hop 2: [AMD](2023) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD explicitly tied IP protection risks to geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan, noting that disruptions in these regions could materially affect product delivery and operations, with international sales at 65%.",
        "Hop 3: [AMD](2024) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD reiterated IP risks amid global geopolitical shifts, including sanctions and export controls, and reported international sales at 66%, showing a continued and slightly increased reliance on foreign markets, thereby amplifying IP risk exposure."

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.  The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.",

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

      "question": "How did ACN's target asset allocation mix for its defined benefit pension plans evolve from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, and what does this multi-year shift suggest about the company's long-term investment strategy and risk-adjusted return objectives?",
      "answer": "ACN's target asset allocation for its defined benefit pension plans showed a strategic shift over the three-year period. In fiscal 2023, the target allocation was referenced in the 2022 10-K filing, which outlined the investment return objective as exceeding inflation over the long term based on the target asset mix for each plan. By fiscal 2024, the company continued to emphasize risk-adjusted returns aligned with the overall investment strategy, maintaining a diversified portfolio of fixed income and equities, with specific attention to matching debt securities' duration to plan liabilities. In fiscal 2025, the target allocation was again referenced in the 2024 10-K, showing continuity in strategy but with updated flexibility ranges to respond to market conditions and required cash flows. This evolution suggests a consistent yet adaptive long-term investment approach focused on balancing return generation with liability matching and risk mitigation.",

In fiscal 2024, Accenture further bolstered its repurchase capacity by securing an additional $4,000 million in authority, raising the total outstanding repurchase authorization to $6,694 million by September 25, 2024.

Each ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc; however a holder of an ordinary share is not entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc or to receive dividends.\n\n## Class A Ordinary Shares\n\nAn Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc's Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.\n\n## Class X Ordinary Shares\n\nMost of our pre-incorporation partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. An Accenture plc Class X ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A Class X ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.\n\n## Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares\n\n## Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares\n\nPre-incorporation partners resident in Canada and New Zealand received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. We may, at our option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.

      "answer": "Accenture's approach to new pricing models has evolved from a general acknowledgment of the need for change in 2022 to a more strategic and investment-driven approach by 2024. In 2022, the company emphasized the importance of introducing new pricing models to reflect the value of technological developments like cloud and as-a-service solutions, warning that failure to do so could negatively impact results of operations. By 2023, Accenture had begun to focus more on innovation and strategic investments in AI and robotics, noting that delays in client spending due to evaluation of new technologies could hinder revenue unless new pricing models were introduced. In 2024, the company underscored its dependence on successfully deploying these pricing models in the context of rapidly evolving AI technologies, with significant investments already being made in AI-based services. Across all three years, a consistent risk highlighted was that if Accenture could not introduce pricing models that reflect the value of new technologies quickly enough, or if client adoption rates were insufficient, this could lead to revenue shortfalls and competitive disadvantages.",

A s we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.\n\nTechnological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud, data and A I solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced, in whole or in part, some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation and making strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies to our current offerings that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions have had and could in the future have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our managed services contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. M any of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. A dditionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of rev enues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties related to the development and use of A I could harm our business, damage our reputation or give rise to legal or regulatory action.\n\nWe are increasingly applying A I-based technologies, including generative A I, to our services and solutions, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",

We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead",

      "answer": "Cisco consistently disclosed the $2,000 million principal amount of the 5.90% Note maturing in February 2039 across all three fiscal years (2022, 2023, and 2024), indicating it remained a stable component of its long-term debt portfolio. However, its proportion relative to total long-term debt and liabilities shifted due to new issuances and reclassifications. In 2022, total long-term debt was $8,416 million, making the 5.90% Note represent about 23.8%. By 2023, long-term debt increased to $6,658 million (with the 5.90% Note remaining at $2,000 million), raising its relative share to approximately 30.1%. In 2024, long-term debt surged to $19,621 million, reducing the 5.90% Note\u2019s proportion to about 10.2%. This shows a significant shift in Cisco\u2019s capital structure, with newer debt issuances diluting the relative importance of the 5.90% Note over time.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco disclosed its AFS debt investments in detail, indicating their material presence in the portfolio. By fiscal 2023, Cisco reported 'higher losses in our available-for-sale debt investments' as a primary driver of a negative shift in other income (loss), net. This trend continued into fiscal 2024, where similar language was used, signaling that AFS debt losses remained a persistent drag on other income. The consistent mention of worsening performance in AFS debt investments in both 2023 and 2024, contrasted with the 2022 baseline that lacked such negative commentary, suggests a multi-year deterioration in this asset class, increasing Cisco\u2019s exposure to and sensitivity from debt market volatility.",

The CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity - including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, ex perience, strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: As of July 27, 2024, 36% of our Ex ecutive Leadership Team (EL T) are women and 43% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity.\n\nWe publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2023 data, our global employee base was comprised of 29% women, 71% men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 48.2% White/Caucasian, 33.5% Asian, 6.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5.6% African American/Black, 2.0% two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino), 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 3.7% prefer to not to disclose/unknown.\n\nWith respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our positive impact. We have published our Social Justice Beliefs &amp; Actions, which is our blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background which is the foundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office helps drive accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and suppliers.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performance-based compensation aligned with each employee's contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions.\n\nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signatory of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org  pledge,  and  are  a  leader  in  the  charge  to  make  fair  pay  a  reality  for  all  employees  through  the  Employers  for  Pay  Equity  Consortium.  We  have  also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\n\nAs part of our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions, we have expanded our pay parity program beyond base salary to include additional forms of compensation fairness such as promotion, bonuses, and stock decisions made in our rewards programs. We aim to ensure the program addresses all employees across the full spectrum of diversity incorporating our global self-reported data collection.\n\n## Health &amp; Well-being\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We seek to provide our employees and their families with highquality, flex ible, and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. We strive to support our employees as they balance careers and personal lives, as well as their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other matters.\n\nWe host ongoing discussions with our employees during the Cisco Beat and Cisco Check-Ins, our regular company-wide virtual meetings, and continue to emphasize our Safe to Talk program. We offer mindfulness courses, employee assistance program offerings, and out-of-network provider benefits for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2024, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We employ a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe know careers are not static pathways that look the same for everyone. We also know that the world of work will continue to rapidly evolve, requiring new skillsets. At Cisco, we believe that your career is owned by you, supported by your leader, and enabled by Cisco. Cisco believes in open-ended self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows best what skills and resources they need to succeed. This means that while each employee has the power to shape their career on their own terms, they also have a supportive ecosystem to develop the skills they need to succeed both today and tomorrow. We strive to",

We provide our employees and their families high-quality, flexible and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal lives, all while managing their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We developed a COVID-19 response and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health. In fiscal 2022, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We have moved towards a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe believe in open-ended, self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need to succeed. We encourage employees to explore assignments outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work. Employees choose their own career paths and we support that choice by providing them with tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nWe believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes regular, virtual all hands, which we refer to as a 'Cisco Check-In,' and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a 'Team Space Check-In.' Our regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cisco Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from business updates to social justice to physical and mental health.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we have seen high level of employee engagement. For example, there were approximately 2.1 million Team Space Check-Ins  by  our  employees  in  fiscal  2022,  reflecting  87%  of  employees  submitting  Team  Space  Check-Ins.  Employees  also participate  in  our  global  Engagement  Pulse  Survey  and  the  Real  Deal  Survey.  These  surveys  allow  our  employees  to  provide confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.\n\n## Purpose Report\n\nAdditional information regarding Cisco's ESG initiatives and our people, as well as our workforce diversity data, can be found in our Purpose Report and related supplemental information, which are located on our ESG Reporting Hub at https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en\\_us/about/csr/esg-hub.html.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, AVGO reported an outstanding principal balance of $606 million for the 5.000% notes due April 2030 with an effective interest rate of 5.18%. This balance remained unchanged in fiscal 2023, still at $606 million with the same interest rate. By fiscal 2024, the balance on these notes remained constant at $606 million, showing no reduction or increase over the three-year period. The consistent principal and interest rate across all three years suggest that AVGO maintained a static approach to this debt instrument, neither accelerating repayments nor issuing additional tranches of this specific note.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Broadcom highlighted Industrial Fiber Optics as part of a broad variety of industrial products used across applications such as industrial automation, power generation, medical systems, defense, aerospace, and electric vehicle subsystems. By 2023, the company categorized Industrial Fiber Optics under a more structured industrial applications framework, specifically factory automation, renewable energy, and automotive electronics, indicating a more focused market alignment. In 2024, Broadcom maintained this positioning but further embedded Industrial Fiber Optics within a broader suite that now explicitly included Ethernet PHYs, switch ICs, and camera microcontrollers, suggesting deeper integration with digital and sensing technologies. This evolution reflects a strategic shift from general industrial component supplier to a more integrated solutions provider targeting high-growth industrial subsegments with advanced connectivity and control capabilities.",

      "answer": "AVGO's outstanding principal balance for the 3.125% notes due January 2025 remained unchanged at $495 million in fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024. This stability in the principal amount suggests that AVGO did not make any early repayments or refinancing adjustments specifically for this debt instrument over the three-year period, indicating a consistent approach to managing this portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio.",

      "question": "How did Broadcom's (AVGO) positioning of its Security Insights Platform within the broader cybersecurity ecosystem evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of integration with in-house tools for security information and event management across mainframe environments?",
      "answer": "Broadcom's Security Insights Platform remained consistently positioned as a tool for assessing mainframe security posture and identifying risks across the 2022\u20132024 filings. However, in 2022, the platform was described as providing data 'available for use with in-house tools for security information and event management.' In 2023, the language expanded slightly to emphasize its role within a broader 'Cybersecurity' category in the Mainframe Software Portfolio, continuing to highlight integration with in-house tools. By 2024, the description remained largely unchanged, suggesting a stable strategic positioning without significant feature evolution. This indicates a consistent focus on enabling enterprise integration without substantial enhancement or repositioning of the platform over the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did Cisco's 3.50% Note evolve in terms of effective interest rate and outstanding amount from fiscal year 2022 through 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's borrowing costs and debt structure over time?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Cisco's 3.50% Note had an outstanding amount of $500 million with an effective interest rate of 3.20%. By fiscal year 2023, the effective rate had increased to 6.38%, and by fiscal year 2024, it further rose to 6.66%, despite the outstanding amount remaining constant at $500 million. This indicates a significant increase in borrowing costs for this particular note over the three-year period, likely reflecting broader market interest rate trends and Cisco's evolving debt financing strategy.",

      "answer": "Cisco maintained a consistent $2,000 million outstanding balance on its 5.90% Senior Notes from 2022 through 2024, with the effective interest rate remaining stable at 6.11% across all three years. This indicates that Cisco has not retired or refinanced this particular tranche of debt during the period, suggesting a deliberate strategy to maintain this higher-yielding long-term liability on its balance sheet.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco disclosed the value of its available-for-sale debt investments in a detailed table, indicating active management of these assets. In fiscal 2023, the company reported higher losses in these investments, negatively impacting other income (loss), net. This trend continued into fiscal 2024, where the company again cited higher losses in available-for-sale debt investments as a primary driver of changes in other income (loss), net. This 3-year trajectory suggests a consistent negative impact from these investments, despite their ongoing presence in Cisco\u2019s portfolio.",

      "answer": "Cisco's pay equity program under the White House Equal Pay Pledge has evolved significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, Cisco introduced a data-driven analytics framework to regularly evaluate pay parity across its complex compensation system, focusing primarily on base salary and committing to correct any identified gaps. By 2023, the company expanded its pay parity program beyond base salary to include broader compensation elements such as promotions, bonuses, and stock decisions, reflecting a more comprehensive view of employee rewards. In 2024, Cisco further enhanced its approach by integrating global self-reported diversity data into its pay equity analysis, ensuring the program addresses all employees across the full spectrum of diversity. This progression shows a clear trajectory from foundational analytics to a more inclusive, global, and multi-dimensional pay equity framework.",

We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, orientation, ability, nationality and background - the foundation of our Conscious Culture.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward and retain talent. It provides market competitive, performancebased compensation aligned with each employee's contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product lines, and functions.\n\nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signer of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and we are leading the charge to make fair pay a reality for all employees through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium. We have also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\n\n## Health &amp; Well-being\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We provide our employees and their families high-quality, flexible and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal lives, all while managing their own physical, emotional, and financial health. We developed a COVID-19 response and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health. In fiscal 2022, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We have moved towards a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe believe in open-ended, self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need to succeed. We encourage employees to explore assignments outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work. Employees choose their own career paths and we support that choice by providing them with tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nWe believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes regular, virtual all hands, which we refer to as a 'Cisco Check-In,' and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a 'Team Space Check-In.' Our regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cisco Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from business updates to social justice to physical and mental health.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we have seen high level of employee engagement. For example, there were approximately 2.1 million Team Space Check-Ins  by  our  employees  in  fiscal  2022,  reflecting  87%  of  employees  submitting  Team  Space  Check-Ins.  Employees  also participate  in  our  global  Engagement  Pulse  Survey  and  the  Real  Deal  Survey.  These  surveys  allow  our  employees  to  provide confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.\n\n## Purpose Report\n\nAdditional information regarding Cisco's ESG initiatives and our people, as well as our workforce diversity data, can be found in our Purpose Report and related supplemental information, which are located on our ESG Reporting Hub at https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en\\_us/about/csr/esg-hub.html.

The CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity - including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, ex perience, strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: As of July 27, 2024, 36% of our Ex ecutive Leadership Team (EL T) are women and 43% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity.\n\nWe publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2023 data, our global employee base was comprised of 29% women, 71% men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 48.2% White/Caucasian, 33.5% Asian, 6.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5.6% African American/Black, 2.0% two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino), 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 3.7% prefer to not to disclose/unknown.\n\nWith respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our positive impact. We have published our Social Justice Beliefs &amp; Actions, which is our blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background which is the foundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office helps drive accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and suppliers.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent.

We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other matters.\n\nWe host ongoing discussions with our employees during the Cisco Beat and Cisco Check-Ins, our regular company-wide virtual meetings, and continue to emphasize our Safe to Talk program. We offer mindfulness courses, employee assistance program offerings, and out-of-network provider benefits for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2024, we continued to offer employees 'A Day for Me,' which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. We employ a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.\n\n## Employee Development\n\nWe know careers are not static pathways that look the same for everyone. We also know that the world of work will continue to rapidly evolve, requiring new skillsets. At Cisco, we believe that your career is owned by you, supported by your leader, and enabled by Cisco. Cisco believes in open-ended self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows best what skills and resources they need to succeed. This means that while each employee has the power to shape their career on their own terms, they also have a supportive ecosystem to develop the skills they need to succeed both today and tomorrow.

In 2022, Industrial Fiber Optics were described as part of a 'broad variety of products for the general industrial and automotive markets' and were explicitly linked to applications in 'industrial automation, power generation and distribution systems, medical systems and equipment, defense and aerospace, and vehicle subsystems including those used in electric vehicle powertrain, infotainment and advanced driver assistance system.' By 2023 and 2024, the product was consistently listed under the 'Industrial' end market alongside 'optocouplers,' 'industrial and medical sensors,' 'motion control encoders and subsystems,' 'light emitting diodes,' and 'Ethernet PHYs, switch ICs and camera microcontrollers'\u2014suggesting continued integration with adjacent technologies. This three-year consistency reveals Broadcom's sustained emphasis on industrial applications, particularly in automation, automotive electronics, and medical systems, while reinforcing its commitment to providing comprehensive industrial semiconductor solutions rather than pursuing a strategic pivot.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom reported a $622 million obligation for the 3.625% notes due October 2024. This amount remained unchanged in fiscal year 2023, indicating no repayments or modifications during that period. However, by fiscal year 2024, the obligation associated with these notes had dropped to $0, signaling full repayment or restructuring of the instrument. This progression indicates a deliberate debt management strategy where Broadcom addressed the near-term maturity by eliminating the liability ahead of its October 2024 due date.",

      "question": "How did the carrying value and effective interest rate of NVIDIA's 1.55% Notes Due 2028 evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend reveal about the company's long-term debt financing strategy?",
      "answer": "The carrying value of NVIDIA's 1.55% Notes Due 2028 increased from $1,200 million in fiscal year 2022 to $1,099 million in 2023, and then rose again to $1,250 million in 2024. The effective interest rate on these notes also increased from an implied rate based on market pricing in 2022 to 1.64% in fiscal year 2024. This pattern suggests that NVIDIA maintained or reacquired the notes after a temporary decrease in 2023, while also facing a modest increase in borrowing costs over time. The company appears to be strategically managing its long-term debt profile by maintaining consistent long-term obligations while navigating changing interest rate environments.",

      "question": "How has the competitive positioning of Lumentum Holdings in NVIDIA's networking product segment evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about NVIDIA's perception of competitive threats in optical interconnect solutions?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lumentum Holdings consistently appeared in NVIDIA's list of competitors in the networking products category, specifically in optical modules. In 2022, Lumentum was listed alongside companies like Juniper Networks and Applied Optoelectronics, indicating a broader competitive landscape. By 2023 and 2024, Juniper and Applied Optoelectronics were no longer mentioned, suggesting NVIDIA's focus narrowed to key players like Lumentum Holdings Inc. This narrowing indicates that Lumentum remained a persistent and possibly growing competitive threat in optical interconnects as NVIDIA emphasized its relevance in the context of AI and accelerated computing infrastructure.",

        "Hop 1: [NVDA](2023) \u2192 [Lumentum Holdings]: Listed among networking competitors including switches, DPUs, and optical modules, with no mention of Juniper or Applied Optoelectronics.",
        "Hop 2: [NVDA](2024) \u2192 [Lumentum Holdings]: Reappearance as a named competitor in networking products, now specifically as 'Lumentum Holdings Inc.', suggesting formal recognition and possible escalation in competitive posture.",
        "Hop 3: [NVDA](2022) \u2192 [Lumentum Holdings]: Named competitor in interconnect and optical solutions, but alongside Juniper Networks and Applied Optoelectronics, indicating a more diverse set of perceived threats in the space."

Our  supply  chain  is  mainly  concentrated  in  the  A sia-Pacific  region.  We  utilize  foundries,  such  as  T aiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSM C, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix Inc., M icron T echnology , Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly , testing and packaging of our final products.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,  conformity  to  industry  standard A PIs,  manufacturing  capabilities,  processor  pricing,  and  total  system  costs.  W e  believe  that  our  ability   to  remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver  consistent  volumes  of  our  products  at  acceptable  levels  of  quality   and  at  competitiv e  prices.  W e  ex pect  competition  to  increase  from  both  ex isting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\n\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for A I, such as A dv anced M icro Devices, Inc., or A M D, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or A I computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as A libaba Group, A lphabet Inc., A mazon, Inc., or A mazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and M icrosoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\n- suppliers of A rm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and M icrosoft;\n- suppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as A mbarella, Inc., A M D, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\n- networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical modules) include such as A M D, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company , Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and M arvell T echnology , Inc. as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally . Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP . The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in A sia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely . We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;",

Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods.

      "question": "What does Apple's inclusion of Floating Rate Notes due 2019 in its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings suggest about its ongoing exposure to short-term debt instruments, and how might this affect its interest expense sensitivity in a rising rate environment?",
      "answer": "Apple's 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings all incorporate by reference the Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014, which includes forms of global notes representing Floating Rate Notes due 2019. The repeated disclosure of these notes across three consecutive years indicates that Apple maintained some level of exposure to these instruments through outstanding obligations or ongoing disclosure obligations, despite their 2019 maturity date. Since floating rate notes adjust with benchmark interest rates, Apple's interest expense on these notes would increase in a rising rate environment, heightening its short-term interest risk exposure. The persistence of these notes in disclosures suggests that Apple may have had rollover obligations or continuing commitments tied to this debt structure, influencing its liquidity planning and capital structure flexibility.",

      "answer": "Apple's inclusion of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its 10-K filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024 shows a consistent disclosure pattern, indicating that the company continued to reference this historical debt instrument as part of its ongoing debt structure documentation, even though the notes were issued in 2013 and matured in 2016. This suggests Apple maintains legacy debt disclosures in its exhibits for transparency and legal continuity, rather than removing them immediately post-maturity.",

      "answer": "Apple first disclosed the 4.45% Notes due 2044 in its 2022 10-K filing as part of its long-term debt structure, indicating it was issued under an Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014. In the 2023 filing, Apple repeated the same disclosure, reaffirming the ongoing existence and structure of the notes. By 2024, Apple again included the 4.45% Notes due 2044 in its exhibit list, maintaining consistency in its long-term debt disclosures. The consistent inclusion of this instrument across all three years suggests a stable long-term capital structure and no material changes or retirements to this specific debt instrument over the period.",

      "answer": "Apple's reference to the 1.05% Notes due 2017 remained consistent across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014as part of its incorporated debt instruments, indicating that while the notes were issued well before this period, they continued to be a documented part of Apple's ongoing capital structure and financial obligations. Despite the notes having matured in 2017, their persistent inclusion in subsequent filings suggests they may have been rolled over, refinanced, or retained in documentation as historical instruments under the same indenture framework. This continuity implies a stable and transparent debt management strategy by Apple, with consistent disclosure practices around legacy instruments.",

In 2022, the note was listed among other global notes in the Officer's Certificate dated May 3, 2013. In 2023, the same note appeared in the filings, showing continuity in disclosure as the maturity date approached. By 2024, Apple still included the 2.40% Notes due 2023 in its exhibit list, even though the notes were set to mature within that year, suggesting a deliberate approach to managing and disclosing legacy debt obligations. This consistent inclusion across three years reflects a stable and transparent debt disclosure strategy.",

      "question": "How did IBM's emphasis on client relationships and trust as a competitive differentiator evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this multi-year progression indicate about its strategic positioning in the hybrid cloud and AI market?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, IBM consistently highlighted client relationships and trust as a core competitive differentiator, but the context in which it was framed evolved. In 2022, IBM emphasized trust as part of its hybrid cloud and AI platform integration, particularly through deep industry expertise and a secure, open platform. By 2023, the company expanded this focus by linking client trust to its strategic partnerships with major tech firms like AWS, Microsoft, and SAP, indicating a broader ecosystem-driven approach to delivering client value. In 2024, IBM reinforced this positioning while also adding cybersecurity-focused partners like Palo Alto Networks to its strategic alliance list, suggesting a growing emphasis on security as a key component of client trust. This 3-year trajectory reveals a strategic evolution where trust is increasingly tied to both technical capabilities (AI, hybrid cloud) and a robust, secure partner ecosystem, aligning with the rising importance of data governance and digital transformation in enterprise IT decisions.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 13.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 13 to 15.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 15 to 16.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our broad range of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we are optimizing our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations, shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into our offerings while building new solutions and modernizing our existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nWe differentiate from other providers, as our breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We leverage a flexible, secure, and open hybrid cloud platform and scale up solutions integrating (1) data, (2) AI for production and automation, (3) deep expertise in industries and business processes, (4) trust and security, along with (5) a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. All of these actions have positioned IBM for accelerated growth now with hybrid cloud and AI while preparing us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.\n\nAs we execute our strategy as a hybrid cloud and AI company, we are regularly exposed to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments.\n\nA summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:\n\n## Software:\n\nThe depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors.

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-TabulatingRecording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 12.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 12 to 14.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 14 to 15.\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\n\nWe proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers, global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients' complex business challenges while accelerating growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others.\n\nCompanies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new competitors.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nOur breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong focus on innovation. All of these attributes position IBM for accelerated growth now and prepare us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.",

      "question": "How did IBM's relationship with the 1.250% Notes due 2027 evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its disclosure and eventual listing as a tradable instrument?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM referenced the 1.250% Notes due 2027 in its 10-K filing, indicating that the instrument defining the rights of the holders was incorporated by reference from a Form 8-K filed on January 30, 2019. In 2023, IBM continued to reference the same instrument but also began listing newer notes issued in 2022 and 2023, showing an expansion in its debt portfolio while maintaining the visibility of the 1.250% Notes due 2027. By 2024, the 1.250% Notes due 2027 were explicitly listed in IBM\u2019s 10-K as a tradable instrument under the ticker IBM27B on the New York Stock Exchange, indicating a shift from mere disclosure to active market participation. This progression shows IBM\u2019s evolving treatment of the instrument from a disclosed obligation to a publicly traded liability.",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM referenced the 0.950% Notes due 2025 as part of a broader list of debt instruments, citing the May 22, 2017 Form 8-K filing (Exhibit 4.1) as the defining instrument. In 2023, IBM continued to reference the same May 2017 filing but began listing the 0.950% Notes due 2025 alongside newer instruments, suggesting increased prominence. By 2024, the 0.950% Notes due 2025 were explicitly listed with a dedicated trading symbol (IBM25B) on the New York Stock Exchange, indicating a shift from internal documentation to active market visibility. This evolution shows IBM's strategic move toward greater transparency and investor accessibility for this instrument over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: IBM(2022) \u2192 0.950% Notes due 2025: Discloses the instrument via reference to May 22, 2017 Form 8-K filing (Exhibit 4.1), among other notes, with no separate trading symbol or market listing.",
        "Hop 2: IBM(2023) \u2192 0.950% Notes due 2025: Continues to reference the same May 2017 filing but begins to be mentioned more prominently in a broader list of instruments, signaling increased attention.",
        "Hop 3: IBM(2024) \u2192 0.950% Notes due 2025: Publicly lists the notes with a distinct trading symbol (IBM25B) on the NYSE, reflecting full market integration and enhanced transparency."

      "question": "How did IBM's exposure to stock exchange regulations evolve from 2022 to 2024 in relation to its debt and equity securities, and what does this multi-year progression reveal about its capital market risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, IBM consistently highlighted its exposure to stock exchange regulations as a key risk factor affecting both its debt and equity securities. In 2022, IBM noted that the value of its debt securities fluctuates due to factors like interest rates, exchange controls, and stock exchange regulations, with no assurance it could manage these risks successfully. In 2023, the company reiterated this exposure, emphasizing that external regulatory environments, including stock exchange regulations, remained a significant uncontrollable factor influencing its securities' value and liquidity. By 2024, IBM expanded on this risk by linking it to broader market liquidity conditions and customer credit risks, indicating a more integrated view of regulatory impact within its financial risk framework. This evolution shows IBM's increasing recognition of regulatory dynamics as a persistent and systemic component of its capital markets exposure, with no material reduction in dependency or mitigation strategy over the three-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [IBM](2022) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: IBM explicitly listed 'stock exchange regulations' as a key external factor influencing the value and liquidity of its debt and equity securities, with no assurance of successful risk management.",
        "Hop 2: [IBM](2023) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: IBM again cited stock exchange regulations as a major uncontrollable factor affecting securities, while also emphasizing cybersecurity and pension-related risks, suggesting regulatory risk remained a constant concern.",
        "Hop 3: [IBM](2024) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: IBM continued to highlight stock exchange regulations as part of a broader set of capital market risks, now explicitly tied to liquidity conditions and credit risk, indicating a more systemic view of regulatory exposure."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Item 2. Properties:\n\nIBM's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31, 2021, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 52 million square feet worldwide.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, IBM's facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 11 million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled nearly 32 million square feet, of which 7 million was owned and 25 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company's cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments.\n\nContinuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations.\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings:\n\nRefer to note S, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' on pages 113 to 115 of IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures:\n\nNot applicable.",

As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe's Photography Plan was introduced as a targeted package within the Creative Cloud, aimed at photographers and photo enthusiasts, offering a more limited offering compared to the full Creative Cloud suite. By 2023, the Photography Plan was more explicitly integrated into Adobe's broader AI-driven strategy, with features like Adobe Firefly and Photoshop's Generative Fill being highlighted as part of the Creative Cloud offerings, suggesting enhanced value for photography-focused subscribers. In 2024, Adobe reinforced the Photography Plan's role within the Creative Cloud, emphasizing its inclusion of AI-powered tools such as Generative Credits and advanced features in Photoshop and Lightroom, indicating a continued strategic push to enhance the plan with cutting-edge capabilities. The trajectory shows a shift from a basic photography suite to a more AI-enhanced, integrated offering within Adobe's creative platform.",

Our  eLearning  solutions  and  web  conferencing  products  face  competition  from  a  number  of  established products from other large software companies. Competition involves a number of factors, including product features, ease-of-use, the level of customization and integration supported, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, their complementarity with our Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Digital Experience products and our strong brand among users.\n\n## PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n## Digital Media Offerings\n\n## Adobe Creative Cloud\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a cloud-based subscription to a collection of Apps that enables creative professionals and enthusiasts alike to express themselves and collaborate with Apps and services for photography, design, video, social media, and more that connect across surfaces, platforms and geographies. Subscribers have access to cloud storage to easily sync, access, collaborate and share their work, files and assets.\n\nCreative  Cloud  paid  plans  include  the  Adobe  Firefly  web  App,  the  premium  version  of  Adobe  Ex press,  and  AI-powered  features  natively  integrated throughout Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Premiere Pro. Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, and Adobe Express plans include a monthly allocation of Generative Credits, which are tokens that enable subscribers to use our generative AI features to generate content using text-based prompts. All Apps listed below and many more are available through subscriptions to Creative Cloud (except Substance 3D Apps, which are sold separately through the Adobe Substance 3D Collection plan), and many of our Apps are also available as standalone subscriptions on Adobe.com. Adobe Acrobat Pro is available as part of our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription and on a standalone basis and allows users to create, convert and edit PDFs, including text and images. Additionally, certain Creative Cloud Apps, such as Adobe Express, are available in Adobe G enStudio for Performance Marketing, allowing users to quickly use assets and Creative Cloud tools to create on-brand content.\n\n## Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom\n\nAdobe Photoshop is the world's most advanced digital imaging and design App, with powerful editing and effects tools to transform photos. It is available on desktop, iPad and through a web version. Features include G enerative Fill, G enerative Expand, G enerate Similar and G enerate Background, which allow our customers to use text prompts to quickly create, add to, remove, duplicate or replace images, or expand the borders of an existing image with AI-generated content without leaving Adobe Photoshop; the Adjustment Brush Tool, whichcombines the traditional workflow of selecting, masking, and applying an adjustment into one step, simplifying the way of making local adjustments; and Distraction Removal smart technology to help remove people, wires, poles and other distractions from images. Adobe Lightroom is our cloud-based photo App that allows subscribers to edit, organize, store and share photos across desktop, tablet, mobile devices and the web. Features include Lens Blur to blur the background or foreground by making a depth map of the photo using AI; the Denoise feature to remove noise in RAW photos; People Masking features to automatically select and edit facial hair and clothing; and G enerative Remove, which uses Adobe Firefly to remove unwanted objects and distractions in a photo. In addition to individual subscriptions to Photoshop and Lightroom, we offer a Photography Plan, which is a more limited cloud-based offering than Creative Cloud, targeted at photographers and photo enthusiasts and includes Photoshop, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic.\n\n## Table of Contents",

Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Creative Cloud Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of business customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval purposes, copywriting or  leveraging  templates  for  social  media  marketing.  We  utilize  channel  partners  to  target  mid-size  creative  customers  with  our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption  of  our  Creative  Cloud  for  enterprise  offering.  Overall,  our  strategy  with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to increase  our  revenue  with  existing  users,  attract  new  customers  and  grow  a  recurring  and  predictable  revenue  stream  that  is recognized ratably.\n\nIn  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  we  expect  to  drive  sustained  long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web's functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat, integrate Adobe Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces, drive innovation with Adobe Sensei (machine-learning/AI) to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Sign APIs, and leverage diversified go-tomarket motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a datadriven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.\n\nAs our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features 'Liquid Mode' to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is also available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe  Sign  also  provides  a  green  alternative  to  costly,  paper-based  solutions  and  offers  a  modern,  convenient  solution  for customers  to  digitally  manage  their  documents,  automate  processes  and  contract  workflows.  We  believe  that  by  growing  the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\n## Opportunity\n\nDigital  transformation  is  a  macro  trend  that  affects  every  business,  government  and  educational  institution  today-every business  is  a  digital  business.  Consumers  today  buy  experiences,  not  just  products,  and  they  demand  personalized  digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, which drives business-to-business ('B2B') companies to deliver business-toconsumer ('B2C') experiences with a 'business-to-everyone' ('B2E') strategy. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world's leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.\n\nAdobe  Experience  Cloud  is  powering  digital  businesses  by  providing  exceptional  experiences  to  their  customers  via  a comprehensive suite of solutions.

In this era of connected creativity, we envision Creative Cloud functioning as a creative system, keeping our users connected to everything and everyone they need to make a project successful. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow by expanding content-first, task-based creativity, advancing every creative category across desktop, web and mobile, expanding 3D and immersive content creation, enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders and inspiring and empowering the creative community through sharing and monetization.\n\nAdobe's  Digital  Media  segment  also  includes  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  a  unified,  cloud-based  document services platform, which integrates Adobe's pioneering PDF technology with our Acrobat and Adobe Sign applications to deliver fully digital document workflows. Digital documents have a mission-critical role in powering modern businesses with hundreds of millions  of  communicators  worldwide  interacting  with  documents  every  day.  With  this  digital  transformation,  we  have  the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. In our Adobe Document Cloud business, Adobe Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption and a leadership  position  in  document-intensive  industries  such  as  government,  financial  services,  pharmaceutical,  legal,  aerospace, insurance and technical publishing. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy, and there are hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document services platform found in Document Cloud.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer  a  range  of  products  and  services  that  allow  individuals,  teams,  small  and  medium  businesses,  enterprises  and  government institutions,  including  both  professionals  and  enthusiasts,  to  design  and  deliver  content  seamlessly.  With  content  creation, consumption and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth through innovation to make our creative applications more accessible and easier to learn and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.\n\nWe continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering content-first, task-based creativity with our launch of Creative Cloud Express, a web and mobile application with a content- and template-first experience to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily, in December 2021. We aim to continue to advance every creative category across desktop, web and mobile. We have delivered our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom, on desktop and mobile devices to allow users the ability to work from anywhere on any device and to collaborate with stakeholders. We are building collaboration deeply into our applications and workflows to enable seamless collaboration across stakeholders. We are taking Creative Cloud to the web, beginning with a public beta version of Photoshop, which will allow Creative Cloud subscribers to make edits to and collaborate on their files directly in their browser. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications. We continue to introduce new features and solutions in our products, such as auto-masking and new and improved neural filters in Photoshop, auto-captioning in Premiere, adjustment layers and perspective grids in Adobe Fresco and additional motion features in Adobe  XD. We  are  pursuing  new  ways  to  inspire,  empower  and  connect  the  creative  community,  such  as  through  our  Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range  of  other  creative  tools  and  services,  including  hobbyist  products,  such  as  Photoshop  Elements  and  Premiere  Elements; libraries  of  creative  assets,  such  as Adobe  Stock  and Adobe  Fonts;  mobile-first  apps,  such  as  Photoshop  Camera;  and  Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under 'Principal Products and Services.'\n\nOn October 7, 2021, Adobe acquired Frame.io and began integrating its leading cloud-based video collaboration platform into  Adobe  Creative  Cloud.  With  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  we  aim  to  make  the  creative  process  even  more  collaborative, productive  and  efficient  by  enhancing  Adobe  Creative  Cloud  with  Frame.io's  cloud-native  collaboration  workflows,  while continuing  to  enable  third-party  applications.  As  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  we  are  more  deeply  integrating  and  enhancing Frame.io's review and approval capabilities in Premiere Pro and After Effects to deliver a native collaborative platform for video editing.\n\nIn our Creative Cloud business, we continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to move our customers to bettervalue offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. As part of our strategy, we use a data-driven operating model and our Digital Experience solutions offered through Adobe",

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe introduced free online self-service learning as part of its comprehensive portfolio of learning and enablement services, hosted on www.training.adobe.com, aimed at assisting customer and partner teams in product adoption. By 2023, this offering remained central to Adobe\u2019s strategy, with learning.adobe.com continuing to serve as the platform for these self-service options, and was explicitly linked to supporting both Digital Experience and Digital Media products. In 2024, Adobe maintained its emphasis on free online self-service learning as a key component of Adobe Digital Learning Services, reinforcing its role in enabling customers to adopt Adobe\u2019s expanding suite of cloud-based and AI-driven tools. The consistent presence of this offering across all three years reflects Adobe\u2019s strategic commitment to scalable, accessible learning solutions that complement its fee-based and custom learning programs.",

We enter these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  technological  developments  in  the  industry  and  ex pand  our  opportunities  to  provide Adobe products, services, and solutions.\n\n## RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT\n\nWith the speed of innovation and technological change that characterizes the software industry, a continuous high level of investment is required for the research and development of the cutting-edge technologies that lead to the development of new products, services and solutions and the continual enhancement of existing products, services and solutions. Our Adobe Research team of research scientists, engineers, artists and designers help turn ideas into technologies that power the future of our products, services and solutions. We are investing, and intend to continue to invest, in research and development to strengthen our existing products, services and solutions, and to expand our offerings across our clouds and the next generation of AI, machine learning and deep learning-driven tools and features to solve problems in areas such as content understanding and generation, recommendations, personalization and more.\n\nIn addition to our own research and development, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe  protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign  intellectual  property  laws, confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and  pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile Apps to users and customers under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  and  customers  under  'click  through'  or  signed  agreements containing  restrictions  on  access  and  use.  Our  enterprise  customers  license  our  hosted  offerings  as  SaaS  or  Managed  Services  via  agreements  based  on  our enterprise licensing terms.\n\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop Apps with the same functionality as our Apps. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.",

      "question": "How did Adobe's strategic positioning and feature evolution of Adobe Document Cloud change between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of integration with AI-powered tools like Firefly and its role in enterprise digital workflows?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe Document Cloud was primarily described as part of a broader 'document and forms platform' within the Publishing and Advertising segment, indicating a more foundational, legacy role in Adobe\u2019s portfolio. By 2023, Document Cloud was elevated as a core component of the Digital Media segment, specifically tied to Adobe\u2019s innovation momentum and positioned alongside AI-driven tools like Adobe Express and Firefly, signaling a shift toward modernization and integration with AI. In 2024, Document Cloud was explicitly detailed as a cloud-based subscription offering with deep integration into AI-powered workflows, including Firefly's generative AI features, and was highlighted for its role in automating enterprise document and signature workflows. This progression reveals Adobe\u2019s transformation of Document Cloud from a legacy infrastructure component into a strategically positioned, AI-enhanced productivity suite for enterprise digital transformation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe introduced the Photography Plan as a targeted package within the Creative Cloud suite, aimed at photographers and photo enthusiasts, offering access to Photoshop, Lightroom, and Lightroom Classic. By 2023, the Photography Plan remained a key part of Adobe\u2019s targeted offerings, with enhancements in AI-powered features across Creative Cloud, including Lightroom Mobile and Photoshop, which increased the value of the plan for photographers. In 2024, Adobe further solidified the Photography Plan\u2019s role by detailing its specific feature set, such as Generative Fill, Lens Blur, and People Masking, and by emphasizing its integration with Adobe Firefly and generative AI capabilities via monthly Generative Credits. This 3-year evolution shows Adobe's strategy to not only maintain the Photography Plan as a distinct offering but also to enhance its capabilities through AI innovation, thereby deepening engagement with the photography community and reinforcing its position as a leader in creative tools.",

Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Creative Cloud Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of business customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval purposes, copywriting or  leveraging  templates  for  social  media  marketing.  We  utilize  channel  partners  to  target  mid-size  creative  customers  with  our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption  of  our  Creative  Cloud  for  enterprise  offering.  Overall,  our  strategy  with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to increase  our  revenue  with  existing  users,  attract  new  customers  and  grow  a  recurring  and  predictable  revenue  stream  that  is recognized ratably.\n\nIn  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  we  expect  to  drive  sustained  long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web's functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat, integrate Adobe Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces, drive innovation with Adobe Sensei (machine-learning/AI) to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Sign APIs, and leverage diversified go-tomarket motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a datadriven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.\n\nAs our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features 'Liquid Mode' to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is also available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe  Sign  also  provides  a  green  alternative  to  costly,  paper-based  solutions  and  offers  a  modern,  convenient  solution  for customers  to  digitally  manage  their  documents,  automate  processes  and  contract  workflows.  We  believe  that  by  growing  the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\n## Opportunity\n\nDigital  transformation  is  a  macro  trend  that  affects  every  business,  government  and  educational  institution  today-every business  is  a  digital  business.  Consumers  today  buy  experiences,  not  just  products,  and  they  demand  personalized  digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, which drives business-to-business ('B2B') companies to deliver business-toconsumer ('B2C') experiences with a 'business-to-everyone' ('B2E') strategy. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world's leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.\n\nAdobe  Experience  Cloud  is  powering  digital  businesses  by  providing  exceptional  experiences  to  their  customers  via  a comprehensive suite of solutions. We continue to believe that addressing the challenges of customer experience management is",

Our  eLearning  solutions  and  web  conferencing  products  face  competition  from  a  number  of  established products from other large software companies. Competition involves a number of factors, including product features, ease-of-use, the level of customization and integration supported, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, their complementarity with our Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Digital Experience products and our strong brand among users.\n\n## PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n## Digital Media Offerings\n\n## Adobe Creative Cloud\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a cloud-based subscription to a collection of Apps that enables creative professionals and enthusiasts alike to express themselves and collaborate with Apps and services for photography, design, video, social media, and more that connect across surfaces, platforms and geographies. Subscribers have access to cloud storage to easily sync, access, collaborate and share their work, files and assets.\n\nCreative  Cloud  paid  plans  include  the  Adobe  Firefly  web  App,  the  premium  version  of  Adobe  Ex press,  and  AI-powered  features  natively  integrated throughout Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Premiere Pro. Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, and Adobe Express plans include a monthly allocation of Generative Credits, which are tokens that enable subscribers to use our generative AI features to generate content using text-based prompts. All Apps listed below and many more are available through subscriptions to Creative Cloud (except Substance 3D Apps, which are sold separately through the Adobe Substance 3D Collection plan), and many of our Apps are also available as standalone subscriptions on Adobe.com. Adobe Acrobat Pro is available as part of our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription and on a standalone basis and allows users to create, convert and edit PDFs, including text and images. Additionally, certain Creative Cloud Apps, such as Adobe Express, are available in Adobe G enStudio for Performance Marketing, allowing users to quickly use assets and Creative Cloud tools to create on-brand content.\n\n## Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom\n\nAdobe Photoshop is the world's most advanced digital imaging and design App, with powerful editing and effects tools to transform photos. It is available on desktop, iPad and through a web version. Features include G enerative Fill, G enerative Expand, G enerate Similar and G enerate Background, which allow our customers to use text prompts to quickly create, add to, remove, duplicate or replace images, or expand the borders of an existing image with AI-generated content without leaving Adobe Photoshop; the Adjustment Brush Tool, whichcombines the traditional workflow of selecting, masking, and applying an adjustment into one step, simplifying the way of making local adjustments; and Distraction Removal smart technology to help remove people, wires, poles and other distractions from images. Adobe Lightroom is our cloud-based photo App that allows subscribers to edit, organize, store and share photos across desktop, tablet, mobile devices and the web. Features include Lens Blur to blur the background or foreground by making a depth map of the photo using AI; the Denoise feature to remove noise in RAW photos; People Masking features to automatically select and edit facial hair and clothing; and G enerative Remove, which uses Adobe Firefly to remove unwanted objects and distractions in a photo. In addition to individual subscriptions to Photoshop and Lightroom, we offer a Photography Plan, which is a more limited cloud-based offering than Creative Cloud, targeted at photographers and photo enthusiasts and includes Photoshop, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic.\n\n## Table of Contents",

      "question": "How did Adobe's positioning of Acrobat evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its role within Document Cloud, integration with other Adobe services, and product enhancements disclosed in each year's filings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe positioned Acrobat as a core component of Adobe Document Cloud with a focus on achieving strong market adoption and maintaining a leadership position in document-intensive industries such as legal, financial services, and publishing. The 2022 filing emphasized Acrobat's role in modernizing document workflows and the ubiquity of PDF usage, with trillions of PDF documents created annually. In 2023, Adobe expanded Acrobat\u2019s positioning by introducing it within a broader context of AI-powered innovation, as part of its Digital Media offerings, and highlighted Acrobat\u2019s integration with Adobe Sign and other Creative Cloud tools to enhance digital document productivity. The 2023 filing also included forward-looking statements about new or enhanced offerings, including AI-driven features. By 2024, Acrobat was formally associated with AI capabilities through the introduction of 'Acrobat AI Assistant' as a registered trademark, signaling a strategic shift toward embedding intelligent automation into document workflows. This evolution shows a clear trajectory from a document standard to an AI-enhanced productivity platform within Adobe\u2019s ecosystem.",

In this era of connected creativity, we envision Creative Cloud functioning as a creative system, keeping our users connected to everything and everyone they need to make a project successful. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow by expanding content-first, task-based creativity, advancing every creative category across desktop, web and mobile, expanding 3D and immersive content creation, enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders and inspiring and empowering the creative community through sharing and monetization.\n\nAdobe's  Digital  Media  segment  also  includes  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  a  unified,  cloud-based  document services platform, which integrates Adobe's pioneering PDF technology with our Acrobat and Adobe Sign applications to deliver fully digital document workflows. Digital documents have a mission-critical role in powering modern businesses with hundreds of millions  of  communicators  worldwide  interacting  with  documents  every  day.  With  this  digital  transformation,  we  have  the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. In our Adobe Document Cloud business, Adobe Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption and a leadership  position  in  document-intensive  industries  such  as  government,  financial  services,  pharmaceutical,  legal,  aerospace, insurance and technical publishing. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy, and there are hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document services platform found in Document Cloud.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer  a  range  of  products  and  services  that  allow  individuals,  teams,  small  and  medium  businesses,  enterprises  and  government institutions,  including  both  professionals  and  enthusiasts,  to  design  and  deliver  content  seamlessly.  With  content  creation, consumption and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth through innovation to make our creative applications more accessible and easier to learn and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.\n\nWe continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering content-first, task-based creativity with our launch of Creative Cloud Express, a web and mobile application with a content- and template-first experience to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily, in December 2021. We aim to continue to advance every creative category across desktop, web and mobile. We have delivered our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom, on desktop and mobile devices to allow users the ability to work from anywhere on any device and to collaborate with stakeholders. We are building collaboration deeply into our applications and workflows to enable seamless collaboration across stakeholders. We are taking Creative Cloud to the web, beginning with a public beta version of Photoshop, which will allow Creative Cloud subscribers to make edits to and collaborate on their files directly in their browser. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications. We continue to introduce new features and solutions in our products, such as auto-masking and new and improved neural filters in Photoshop, auto-captioning in Premiere, adjustment layers and perspective grids in Adobe Fresco and additional motion features in Adobe  XD. We  are  pursuing  new  ways  to  inspire,  empower  and  connect  the  creative  community,  such  as  through  our  Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range  of  other  creative  tools  and  services,  including  hobbyist  products,  such  as  Photoshop  Elements  and  Premiere  Elements; libraries  of  creative  assets,  such  as Adobe  Stock  and Adobe  Fonts;  mobile-first  apps,  such  as  Photoshop  Camera;  and  Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under 'Principal Products and Services.'\n\nOn October 7, 2021, Adobe acquired Frame.io and began integrating its leading cloud-based video collaboration platform into  Adobe  Creative  Cloud.  With  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  we  aim  to  make  the  creative  process  even  more  collaborative, productive  and  efficient  by  enhancing  Adobe  Creative  Cloud  with  Frame.io's  cloud-native  collaboration  workflows,  while continuing  to  enable  third-party  applications.  As  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  we  are  more  deeply  integrating  and  enhancing Frame.io's review and approval capabilities in Premiere Pro and After Effects to deliver a native collaborative platform for video editing.\n\nIn our Creative Cloud business, we continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to move our customers to bettervalue offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. As part of our strategy, we use a data-driven operating model and our Digital Experience solutions offered through Adobe",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Adobe consistently maintained its offering of free online self-service learning as a core component of its Digital Learning Services, but made a notable domain infrastructure change that reflects brand alignment and potential user experience improvements. In 2022, Adobe hosted these resources on 'www.training.adobe.com,' emphasizing the platform's role in assisting customer and partner teams in product adoption and skill development. By 2023, the domain was updated to 'learning.adobe.com,' signaling a more holistic positioning of learning within Adobe\u2019s broader customer enablement strategy. In 2024, Adobe continued to use 'learning.adobe.com' and reinforced the integration of these free resources with its enterprise-focused custom learning services, particularly for large clients needing tailored training and skills assessments. While there was no explicit mention of quantitative changes, the shift from 'training' to 'learning' and the continued emphasis on supporting both consumer and enterprise segments indicates a strategic evolution toward a more unified and scalable learning ecosystem.",

To assist partners in building their respective digital practices, Adobe Global Services provides a comprehensive set of deliverables through Adobe's Solution Partner Program. The breadth of services described in the program provides system integrators, agencies and regional partners the tools required to develop core capabilities for positioning and  building  with Adobe  technology,  as  well  as  implementing  and  running  customer  platforms.  We  believe  that  through  these programmatic services and support, our joint customers benefit greatly from the combination of Adobe technology and the deep customer context that our global partners represent.\n\n## Customer Success Account Management\n\nAdobe Customer Solutions provides Customer Success Managers, who work with enterprise and commercial customers on an  ongoing  basis  to  understand  their  current  and  future  business  needs,  promote  faster  solution  adoption  and  align  product capabilities  to  customers'  business  objectives  to  maximize  the  return  on  their  investment  in  Adobe's  offerings.  We  engage customers to share innovative best practices, relevant industry and vertical knowledge and proven success strategies based on our extensive engagements with leading marketers and brands. The performance of these teams is directly associated with customerfocused outcomes.\n\n## Technical Support\n\nAdobe provides enterprise maintenance and support services to customers of subscription products as part of the subscription entitlement and to perpetual license customers via annual fee-based maintenance and support programs. These offerings provide customers with:\n\n- technical support on the products customers have purchased from Adobe;\n- 'how to' help in using our products; and\n- product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support or subscription period, which is typically one to three years.\n\nWe provide  product  support  through  our  support  organization  that  includes  several  regional  and  global  support  centers, supplemented with outsourced vendors for specific services. Customers can seek help through multiple channels including phone, chat, web, social media and email, allowing quick and easy access to the information they need. These teams are responsible for providing timely, high-quality technical expertise on all our products.\n\nCertain consumers are eligible to receive Getting Started support, to assist with easy adoption of their products. Support for some products and in some countries may vary. For enterprise customers with greater support needs, we offer personalized service options  through  Premium  Services  options,  delivered  by  global  support  centers  and  technical  account  managers  who  can  also provide proactive risk mitigation services and on-site support services for those with business-critical deployments.\n\nWe also offer delivery assurance, technical support and enablement services to partners and developer organizations. We provide developers with high-quality tools, software development kits, information and services.\n\n## Digital Learning Services\n\nAdobe Customer Solutions offers a comprehensive portfolio of learning and enablement services to assist our customer and partner teams in the use of our products, including those within Digital Experience, Digital Media and other legacy products and solutions. Our training portfolio includes a large number of free online self-service learning options on www.training.adobe.com. Adobe  Digital  Learning  Services  also  has  an  extensive  portfolio  of  fee-based  learning  programs  including  a  wide  range  of traditional classroom, virtual and on-demand training and certifications delivered by our team of training professionals and partners across the globe.\n\nThese core offerings are complemented by our custom learning services, which support our largest enterprise customers and their unique requirements. Solution-specific skills assessments help our enterprise customers objectively assess the knowledge and competencies within their marketing teams and tailor their learning priorities accordingly.\n\n## Investments\n\nFrom time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter into these investments with the intent of  securing  financial  returns  as  well  as  for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  emerging  markets  and technologies and expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services.",

We enter these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  technological  developments  in  the  industry  and  ex pand  our  opportunities  to  provide Adobe products, services, and solutions.\n\n## RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT\n\nWith the speed of innovation and technological change that characterizes the software industry, a continuous high level of investment is required for the research and development of the cutting-edge technologies that lead to the development of new products, services and solutions and the continual enhancement of existing products, services and solutions. Our Adobe Research team of research scientists, engineers, artists and designers help turn ideas into technologies that power the future of our products, services and solutions. We are investing, and intend to continue to invest, in research and development to strengthen our existing products, services and solutions, and to expand our offerings across our clouds and the next generation of AI, machine learning and deep learning-driven tools and features to solve problems in areas such as content understanding and generation, recommendations, personalization and more.\n\nIn addition to our own research and development, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe  protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign  intellectual  property  laws, confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and  pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile Apps to users and customers under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  and  customers  under  'click  through'  or  signed  agreements containing  restrictions  on  access  and  use.  Our  enterprise  customers  license  our  hosted  offerings  as  SaaS  or  Managed  Services  via  agreements  based  on  our enterprise licensing terms.\n\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop Apps with the same functionality as our Apps. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.",

Firefly Services provides enterprises with APIs, tools and services for content generation, editing and assembly, to automate the production of content while maintaining quality and control. Custom Models enable enterprises to train generative AI models based on their intellectual property, product and brand styles across a wide variety of use cases such as localization or merchandising for e-commerce, maintaining and propagating brand consistency at scale across their organizations.\n\nAdobe Firefly-generated content is designed to be commercially safe. The Firefly generative AI model is trained on data Adobe has the rights to use. Every asset created using Firefly includes Content Credentials, a digital 'nutrition label', to indicate that generative AI was used, bringing more trust and transparency to digital content.\n\n## Adobe Stock\n\nAdobe Stock provides designers and businesses with access to millions of high-quality, curated, royalty-free photos, vectors, illustrations, videos, templates, audio and 3D assets, for all their creative projects.

      "answer": "AVGO's exposure to the 5.000% notes due April 2030 decreased from $1,086 million in 2022 to $606 million in both 2023 and 2024, indicating a deliberate reduction in this specific debt obligation over the three-year period.

      "question": "How did Broadcom's (AVGO) outstanding principal balance for its 3.125% notes due January 2025 evolve from fiscal 2022 through 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's debt management strategy for this specific instrument?",
      "answer": "Broadcom maintained a consistent $495 million outstanding principal balance for its 3.125% notes due January 2025 across all three fiscal years (2022, 2023, and 2024), indicating no repayments or additional issuances for this specific debt instrument during the period. This stability suggests a deliberate debt management strategy where Broadcom preserved this liability on its balance sheet, potentially leveraging its predictability in interest expense and maturity timing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO had $622 million in principal outstanding for the 3.625% notes due October 2024. By 2023, this amount remained unchanged at $622 million, indicating no repayments or modifications during the year. However, by 2024, the company had completely retired this liability, as the notes no longer appeared in the debt schedule, suggesting that AVGO either repaid or refinanced the obligation ahead of its maturity. This progression shows a deliberate near-term debt management strategy where AVGO addressed maturing obligations before their due dates.",

      "question": "How has Broadcom's positioning of its Security Insights Platform evolved across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of integration with enterprise security tools and emphasis on mainframe risk assessment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Broadcom described the Security Insights Platform as a solution that 'quickly interprets and assesses mainframe security posture, identifying risks and developing remediation steps,' with data available for use with in-house tools for security information and event management (SIEM). In 2023, the description remained largely consistent, continuing to highlight the platform\u2019s ability to 'identify risks and proactively respond to potential threats' within the mainframe environment. By 2024, the platform retained its core functionality but was presented with a slightly stronger emphasis on integration, noting that the data is available for use with 'in-house tools for security information and event management'\u2014a subtle but meaningful reaffirmation of its role in enterprise security ecosystems. While the core capabilities remained stable across the three years, the 2024 presentation reflects a more deliberate alignment with enterprise-wide security strategies, suggesting a maturing narrative around mainframe integration into broader cybersecurity frameworks.",

      "question": "How did Adobe's Photography Plan evolve from 2022 to 2024 in terms of positioning within the Creative Cloud suite, and what does this reveal about Adobe's strategy toward photographers and photo enthusiasts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe introduced the Photography Plan as a 'targeted package' within the Creative Cloud suite, positioning it as a more limited offering tailored for photographers and photo enthusiasts. By 2023, the Photography Plan was explicitly tied to Adobe's broader AI-driven innovation strategy, benefiting from features like Generative Fill and Generative Expand in Photoshop, which enhanced its appeal and utility for users. In 2024, Adobe further solidified the Photography Plan\u2019s role by integrating it with Adobe Firefly and AI-powered tools, including Lens Blur and Denoise in Lightroom, reinforcing its position as a key offering for photographers within the Creative Cloud ecosystem. This evolution indicates Adobe's strategic focus on deepening the value of the Photography Plan through AI enhancements and tighter integration with flagship tools to retain and grow its photography-focused customer base.",

Adobe.com is the central destination where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our customers have the flexibility to subscribe to over twenty of our Creative Cloud products through a single subscription or, for many of our applications, through various collections of our individual subscriptions to point products. To better serve our current users and potential users, we offer free and premium levels for certain applications, such as Creative Cloud Express, and targeted packages and suites, such as our Photography Plan and Substance 3D Collection. We use our data-driven operating model to optimize conversion of our users of free apps and trials to paid subscribers. Our collaboration tools and services help us to further expand our universe of business customers beyond creative professionals to other stakeholders who use our products for review and approval purposes, copywriting or  leveraging  templates  for  social  media  marketing.  We  utilize  channel  partners  to  target  mid-size  creative  customers  with  our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption  of  our  Creative  Cloud  for  enterprise  offering.  Overall,  our  strategy  with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to increase  our  revenue  with  existing  users,  attract  new  customers  and  grow  a  recurring  and  predictable  revenue  stream  that  is recognized ratably.\n\nIn  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  we  expect  to  drive  sustained  long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued expansion of our customer base by continuing to deliver the best PDF experience on and across every platform, improve Acrobat web's functionality and single-click ease of use, expand the number of task-based actions in Acrobat, integrate Adobe Sign into Acrobat across all surfaces, drive innovation with Adobe Sensei (machine-learning/AI) to make both new and legacy documents more intelligent and responsive, unlock business workflows through PDF and Adobe Sign APIs, and leverage diversified go-tomarket motions to reach all segments. With over 50 million searches for PDF-related actions per month, we intend to harness that demand and attract new users to our Document Cloud services through Acrobat web, which allows anyone to quickly access tools to create, edit, convert, sign and compress PDFs through their web browser. As with our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize a datadriven operating model to market our Document Cloud solutions and optimize our subscription-based pricing for individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our reach in our key markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our partnerships with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow and Notarize.\n\nAs our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across devices and the web, we are expanding our Document Cloud capabilities to meet this need. Acrobat Reader is available on mobile devices, with many of its standard features available on the go, and features 'Liquid Mode' to automatically reformat PDFs for quick navigation and easier consumption on smaller screens. Acrobat is also available on the web, delivering quick results for common PDF actions with a single click. Adobe Scan powers mobile devices with scanning capabilities, transforming paper documents into full-featured PDFs. Adobe  Sign  also  provides  a  green  alternative  to  costly,  paper-based  solutions  and  offers  a  modern,  convenient  solution  for customers  to  digitally  manage  their  documents,  automate  processes  and  contract  workflows.  We  believe  that  by  growing  the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI and continuing to add new capabilities to our Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign offerings, we can help our customers continue to migrate away from paper-based processes and adopt our solutions to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\n## Opportunity\n\nDigital  transformation  is  a  macro  trend  that  affects  every  business,  government  and  educational  institution  today-every business  is  a  digital  business.  Consumers  today  buy  experiences,  not  just  products,  and  they  demand  personalized  digital experiences that are relevant, engaging, seamless and secure across an ever-expanding range of channels and devices. Business customers increasingly have the same expectations, which drives business-to-business ('B2B') companies to deliver business-toconsumer ('B2C') experiences with a 'business-to-everyone' ('B2E') strategy. Delivering the best, personalized experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content across multiple channels in real time and at scale. In turn, executives, including those at the world's leading brands, are increasingly seeking solutions that enable real-time personalization at scale. Marketing and IT teams are looking for a return on investment to demonstrate the business impact of their transformation initiatives.\n\nAdobe  Experience  Cloud  is  powering  digital  businesses  by  providing  exceptional  experiences  to  their  customers  via  a comprehensive suite of solutions. We continue to believe that addressing the challenges of customer experience management is",

Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, and Adobe Express plans include a monthly allocation of Generative Credits, which are tokens that enable subscribers to use our generative AI features to generate content using text-based prompts. All Apps listed below and many more are available through subscriptions to Creative Cloud (except Substance 3D Apps, which are sold separately through the Adobe Substance 3D Collection plan), and many of our Apps are also available as standalone subscriptions on Adobe.com. Adobe Acrobat Pro is available as part of our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription and on a standalone basis and allows users to create, convert and edit PDFs, including text and images. Additionally, certain Creative Cloud Apps, such as Adobe Express, are available in Adobe G enStudio for Performance Marketing, allowing users to quickly use assets and Creative Cloud tools to create on-brand content.\n\n## Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom\n\nAdobe Photoshop is the world's most advanced digital imaging and design App, with powerful editing and effects tools to transform photos. It is available on desktop, iPad and through a web version. Features include G enerative Fill, G enerative Expand, G enerate Similar and G enerate Background, which allow our customers to use text prompts to quickly create, add to, remove, duplicate or replace images, or expand the borders of an existing image with AI-generated content without leaving Adobe Photoshop; the Adjustment Brush Tool, whichcombines the traditional workflow of selecting, masking, and applying an adjustment into one step, simplifying the way of making local adjustments; and Distraction Removal smart technology to help remove people, wires, poles and other distractions from images. Adobe Lightroom is our cloud-based photo App that allows subscribers to edit, organize, store and share photos across desktop, tablet, mobile devices and the web. Features include Lens Blur to blur the background or foreground by making a depth map of the photo using AI; the Denoise feature to remove noise in RAW photos; People Masking features to automatically select and edit facial hair and clothing; and G enerative Remove, which uses Adobe Firefly to remove unwanted objects and distractions in a photo.

      "question": "How did Adobe's strategic positioning of Acrobat evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of AI integration, market adoption in document-intensive industries, and the expansion of its digital document services platform?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe emphasized Acrobat's strong market adoption and leadership position in document-intensive industries such as legal, financial services, and publishing, highlighting its integration with Adobe Sign and the Document Cloud platform to modernize digital workflows. By 2023, Adobe introduced forward-looking statements about AI innovation, including the vision to embed artificial intelligence across its offerings, signaling a strategic pivot toward AI-powered enhancements for Acrobat. In 2024, Adobe formally introduced the 'Acrobat AI Assistant' as part of its trademark portfolio, indicating a concrete realization of its AI integration strategy and positioning Acrobat as a next-generation, intelligent document solution. This evolution shows a clear trajectory from market leadership in document productivity to AI-driven innovation, with strategic emphasis on expanding the platform\u2019s capabilities and reinforcing its role in digital transformation across industries.",

In this era of connected creativity, we envision Creative Cloud functioning as a creative system, keeping our users connected to everything and everyone they need to make a project successful. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow by expanding content-first, task-based creativity, advancing every creative category across desktop, web and mobile, expanding 3D and immersive content creation, enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders and inspiring and empowering the creative community through sharing and monetization.\n\nAdobe's  Digital  Media  segment  also  includes  our  Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  a  unified,  cloud-based  document services platform, which integrates Adobe's pioneering PDF technology with our Acrobat and Adobe Sign applications to deliver fully digital document workflows. Digital documents have a mission-critical role in powering modern businesses with hundreds of millions  of  communicators  worldwide  interacting  with  documents  every  day.  With  this  digital  transformation,  we  have  the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. In our Adobe Document Cloud business, Adobe Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption and a leadership  position  in  document-intensive  industries  such  as  government,  financial  services,  pharmaceutical,  legal,  aerospace, insurance and technical publishing. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy, and there are hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document services platform found in Document Cloud.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer  a  range  of  products  and  services  that  allow  individuals,  teams,  small  and  medium  businesses,  enterprises  and  government institutions,  including  both  professionals  and  enthusiasts,  to  design  and  deliver  content  seamlessly.  With  content  creation, consumption and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth through innovation to make our creative applications more accessible and easier to learn and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.\n\nWe continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering content-first, task-based creativity with our launch of Creative Cloud Express, a web and mobile application with a content- and template-first experience to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily, in December 2021. We aim to continue to advance every creative category across desktop, web and mobile. We have delivered our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom, on desktop and mobile devices to allow users the ability to work from anywhere on any device and to collaborate with stakeholders. We are building collaboration deeply into our applications and workflows to enable seamless collaboration across stakeholders. We are taking Creative Cloud to the web, beginning with a public beta version of Photoshop, which will allow Creative Cloud subscribers to make edits to and collaborate on their files directly in their browser. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications. We continue to introduce new features and solutions in our products, such as auto-masking and new and improved neural filters in Photoshop, auto-captioning in Premiere, adjustment layers and perspective grids in Adobe Fresco and additional motion features in Adobe  XD. We  are  pursuing  new  ways  to  inspire,  empower  and  connect  the  creative  community,  such  as  through  our  Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range  of  other  creative  tools  and  services,  including  hobbyist  products,  such  as  Photoshop  Elements  and  Premiere  Elements; libraries  of  creative  assets,  such  as Adobe  Stock  and Adobe  Fonts;  mobile-first  apps,  such  as  Photoshop  Camera;  and  Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under 'Principal Products and Services.'\n\nOn October 7, 2021, Adobe acquired Frame.io and began integrating its leading cloud-based video collaboration platform into  Adobe  Creative  Cloud.  With  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  we  aim  to  make  the  creative  process  even  more  collaborative, productive  and  efficient  by  enhancing  Adobe  Creative  Cloud  with  Frame.io's  cloud-native  collaboration  workflows,  while continuing  to  enable  third-party  applications.  As  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  we  are  more  deeply  integrating  and  enhancing Frame.io's review and approval capabilities in Premiere Pro and After Effects to deliver a native collaborative platform for video editing.\n\nIn our Creative Cloud business, we continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to move our customers to bettervalue offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. As part of our strategy, we use a data-driven operating model and our Digital Experience solutions offered through Adobe",

      "question": "How has Adobe's emphasis on free online self-service learning evolved across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of its positioning within Adobe Digital Learning Services and the platforms used to deliver these offerings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe introduced free online self-service learning as part of a broader enablement strategy, hosted on www.training.adobe.com, emphasizing its role in assisting customer and partner teams in product adoption. By 2023, the company continued to provide these free options but shifted the domain to learning.adobe.com, indicating a more centralized or rebranded approach to digital learning. In 2024, Adobe reinforced its production and delivery of these learning tools on the same platform (learning.adobe.com), integrating them more deeply into a comprehensive portfolio that also included fee-based and custom learning programs. This 3-year trajectory shows a consistent strategic emphasis on self-service learning as a core component of Adobe\u2019s customer enablement, with a shift in platform branding and an increased integration into the broader Adobe Learning Services ecosystem, suggesting a maturing and more structured approach to digital education.",

To assist partners in building their respective digital practices, Adobe Global Services provides a comprehensive set of deliverables through Adobe's Solution Partner Program. The breadth of services described in the program provides system integrators, agencies and regional partners the tools required to develop core capabilities for positioning and  building  with Adobe  technology,  as  well  as  implementing  and  running  customer  platforms.  We  believe  that  through  these programmatic services and support, our joint customers benefit greatly from the combination of Adobe technology and the deep customer context that our global partners represent.\n\n## Customer Success Account Management\n\nAdobe Customer Solutions provides Customer Success Managers, who work with enterprise and commercial customers on an  ongoing  basis  to  understand  their  current  and  future  business  needs,  promote  faster  solution  adoption  and  align  product capabilities  to  customers'  business  objectives  to  maximize  the  return  on  their  investment  in  Adobe's  offerings.  We  engage customers to share innovative best practices, relevant industry and vertical knowledge and proven success strategies based on our extensive engagements with leading marketers and brands. The performance of these teams is directly associated with customerfocused outcomes.\n\n## Technical Support\n\nAdobe provides enterprise maintenance and support services to customers of subscription products as part of the subscription entitlement and to perpetual license customers via annual fee-based maintenance and support programs. These offerings provide customers with:\n\n- technical support on the products customers have purchased from Adobe;\n- 'how to' help in using our products; and\n- product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support or subscription period, which is typically one to three years.\n\nWe provide  product  support  through  our  support  organization  that  includes  several  regional  and  global  support  centers, supplemented with outsourced vendors for specific services. Customers can seek help through multiple channels including phone, chat, web, social media and email, allowing quick and easy access to the information they need. These teams are responsible for providing timely, high-quality technical expertise on all our products.\n\nCertain consumers are eligible to receive Getting Started support, to assist with easy adoption of their products.

For enterprise customers with greater support needs, we offer personalized service options  through  Premium  Services  options,  delivered  by  global  support  centers  and  technical  account  managers  who  can  also provide proactive risk mitigation services and on-site support services for those with business-critical deployments.\n\nWe also offer delivery assurance, technical support and enablement services to partners and developer organizations. We provide developers with high-quality tools, software development kits, information and services.\n\n## Digital Learning Services\n\nAdobe Customer Solutions offers a comprehensive portfolio of learning and enablement services to assist our customer and partner teams in the use of our products, including those within Digital Experience, Digital Media and other legacy products and solutions.

Solution-specific skills assessments help our enterprise customers objectively assess the knowledge and competencies within their marketing teams and tailor their learning priorities accordingly.\n\n## Investments\n\nFrom time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies.

We enter these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for  strategic  purposes,  as  they  often  increase  our  knowledge  of  technological  developments  in  the  industry  and  ex pand  our  opportunities  to  provide Adobe products, services, and solutions.\n\n## RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT\n\nWith the speed of innovation and technological change that characterizes the software industry, a continuous high level of investment is required for the research and development of the cutting-edge technologies that lead to the development of new products, services and solutions and the continual enhancement of existing products, services and solutions. Our Adobe Research team of research scientists, engineers, artists and designers help turn ideas into technologies that power the future of our products, services and solutions. We are investing, and intend to continue to invest, in research and development to strengthen our existing products, services and solutions, and to expand our offerings across our clouds and the next generation of AI, machine learning and deep learning-driven tools and features to solve problems in areas such as content understanding and generation, recommendations, personalization and more.\n\nIn addition to our own research and development, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\n\n## PROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe  protect  our  intellectual  property  through  a  combination  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  trade  secrets,  foreign  intellectual  property  laws, confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual  provisions.  We  have  U.S.  and  international  patents  and  pending  applications  that  relate  to  various  aspects  of  our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\n\nWe license our desktop software and mobile Apps to users and customers under 'click through' or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication,  disclosure  and  transfer.  Similarly,  cloud  products  and  services  are  provided  to  users  and  customers  under  'click  through'  or  signed  agreements containing  restrictions  on  access  and  use.  Our  enterprise  customers  license  our  hosted  offerings  as  SaaS  or  Managed  Services  via  agreements  based  on  our enterprise licensing terms.\n\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop Apps with the same functionality as our Apps. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe Document Cloud was positioned as part of a 'legacy' product suite within the Publishing and Advertising segment, indicating a more traditional role in document and forms management. By 2023, Document Cloud was elevated as a core component of Adobe's Digital Media segment, explicitly integrated alongside flagship tools like Creative Cloud and Acrobat, signaling a shift toward a more strategic, productivity-focused positioning. In 2024, Document Cloud was further enhanced with AI-powered workflows and positioned as a cloud-based enterprise solution with API integrations, Acrobat Sign, and mobile capabilities, emphasizing automation and business productivity. This evolution from a legacy offering to an AI-enhanced, enterprise-grade productivity platform suggests Adobe is positioning Document Cloud as a key enabler of digital transformation and a contributor to its recurring revenue model, especially within enterprise markets.",

By 2023, Frame.io was described as a cloud-native creative collaboration platform with support for still images, design files, and PDFs, and was integrated with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects for frame-specific feedback. In 2024, Frame.io's capabilities were expanded to include support for video beyond post-production workflows\u2014such as casting, location scouting, and marketing campaign management\u2014and was integrated with additional Adobe applications including Photoshop, Lightroom, and Workfront, as well as being positioned as part of Adobe GenStudio for enterprise-scale content production.",

Firefly Services provides enterprises with APIs, tools and services for content generation, editing and assembly, to automate the production of content while maintaining quality and control. Custom Models enable enterprises to train generative AI models based on their intellectual property, product and brand styles across a wide variety of use cases such as localization or merchandising for e-commerce, maintaining and propagating brand consistency at scale across their organizations.\n\nAdobe Firefly-generated content is designed to be commercially safe. The Firefly generative AI model is trained on data Adobe has the rights to use. Every asset created using Firefly includes Content Credentials, a digital 'nutrition label', to indicate that generative AI was used, bringing more trust and transparency to digital content.\n\n## Adobe Stock\n\nAdobe Stock provides designers and businesses with access to millions of high-quality, curated, royalty-free photos, vectors, illustrations, videos, templates, audio and 3D assets, for all their creative projects.

Frame.io includes support for video beyond post-production workflows including casting, location scouting, footage reviews, and marketing campaign management, as well as still images, design files and PDFs. Frame.io is directly integrated with Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Workfront to allow video creators to request and receive streamlined frame-specific comments directly in those Apps.  Frame.io's  Camera to  Cloud functionality allows creators to automatically upload footage from cameras and other recording devices on set directly into Frame.io for review, with integrations for still image cameras that can connect natively to the platform. Frame.io, along with Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly Services, are available in Adobe G enStudio to enable content production at scale.\n\n## Adobe Substance 3D Collection\n\nAdobe Substance 3D is an ecosystem of desktop Apps, including Substance 3D Stager, Substance 3D Painter, Substance 3D Sampler, Substance 3D Designer and Substance 3D Modeler.

      "answer": "Oracle first introduced the 2.875% Notes due 2031 in 2022 as part of a broader issuance of notes, including 2.500% Notes due 2025 and 2.950% Notes due 2030. In 2023, the company continued to reference the 2.875% Notes due 2031 alongside newer issuances such as the 4.500% Notes due 2028 and 4.900% Notes due 2033. By 2024, the 2.875% Notes due 2031 remained a consistent part of Oracle's debt portfolio, appearing alongside even higher-yielding instruments like the 5.800% Notes due 2025 and 6.900% Notes due 2052. This progression shows Oracle's strategy of maintaining a mix of long-term and mid-term debt instruments, with a continued reliance on the 2.875% Notes due 2031 as a stable component of its capital structure while layering in newer, higher-yield notes to meet evolving financing needs.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and introduction of the 1.650% Notes due 2026 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this pattern suggest about Oracle's broader debt strategy during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle issued the 1.650% Notes due 2026 as part of a broader set of debt instruments, indicating the initial inclusion of this bond in Oracle's capital structure. In 2023, Oracle reintroduced the 1.650% Notes due 2026 alongside higher-yielding debt instruments, suggesting a continued reliance on this specific bond as part of its financing mix. In 2024, Oracle again referenced the 1.650% Notes due 2026, maintaining its presence in the portfolio while newer, higher-yielding notes were also introduced. This consistent inclusion of the 1.650% Notes over three years indicates Oracle's strategic use of this bond to maintain a stable, lower-cost component of its overall debt structure, even as it introduced higher-yielding instruments to meet evolving capital needs.",

      "question": "What does the consistent disclosure of Oracle's 4.30% Note due 2034 in its filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024 indicate about the company's long-term debt structure and financing priorities across these reporting periods?",
      "answer": "Oracle's 4.30% Note due 2034 was disclosed in filings for all three years \u2014 2022, 2023, and 2024 \u2014 indicating that the instrument remained a persistent and notable component of Oracle\u2019s long-term debt portfolio. In 2022, the note was listed alongside other instruments such as the 3.625% Note due 2023 and the 4.50% Note due 2044, suggesting a diversified maturity profile. In 2023, the 4.30% Note due 2034 was disclosed alongside newer instruments like the 2.950% Notes due 2024, showing Oracle\u2019s continued reliance on long-dated debt while also issuing shorter-term instruments. In 2024, the note remained included in disclosures, reinforcing its ongoing relevance in Oracle\u2019s capital structure. This consistent inclusion suggests Oracle has maintained a strategic focus on long-term financing, with the 4.30% Note due 2034 serving as a stable element within a broader, evolving debt portfolio.",

        "Hop 3: ORCL(2024) \u2192 4.30% Note 2034: The note continued to be disclosed, reinforcing its persistent role in Oracle\u2019s long-term financing strategy despite the introduction of newer debt instruments."

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and introduction of the 3.650% Notes due 2041 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about Oracle's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle issued the 3.650% Notes due 2041 as part of a broader bond issuance that included various maturities and interest rates. In 2023, Oracle continued to reference the 3.650% Notes due 2041, indicating ongoing commitment to this long-term debt instrument alongside newer bond offerings. By 2024, Oracle maintained the inclusion of the 3.650% Notes due 2041 in its disclosures, suggesting stability in its long-term financing structure and a consistent approach to managing long-term liabilities. This 3-year consistency in referencing the same note issuance indicates a stable, long-term capital strategy with an emphasis on predictable debt servicing.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and structuring of its 2.300% Notes due 2028 evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern reveal about the company's broader debt financing strategy?",
      "answer": "Oracle first referenced the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in 2022 as part of a broader set of debt instruments outlined in Exhibit 4.16, which included other notes issued in March 2021. In 2023, the company again included the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in Exhibit 4.14, maintaining continuity in its disclosure of this instrument alongside newer notes issued in late 2022 and early 2023. In 2024, Oracle once more carried forward the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in Exhibit 4.14, keeping it visible among its active debt instruments. The consistent inclusion of these notes across all three years indicates Oracle's ongoing reliance on this specific debt structure, suggesting a stable and deliberate approach to long-term financing with an emphasis on maintaining a diverse maturity profile.",

      "answer": "ACN's target asset allocation strategy for its defined benefit pension plans showed a gradual shift toward more fixed income instruments over the three-year period. In fiscal 2023, the weighted-average allocation as of August 31, 2022, was 55% fixed income and 45% equities. By fiscal 2024, with allocations as of August 31, 2023, the balance had moved to 58% fixed income and 42% equities. In fiscal 2025, based on the allocation as of August 31, 2024, the fixed income portion increased further to 61%, while equities decreased to 39%. This indicates a consistent trend toward de-risking the portfolio by increasing exposure to less volatile fixed income assets.",

In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with us.

Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy.

To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities.

Each ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc; however a holder of an ordinary share is not entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc or to receive dividends.\n\n## Class A Ordinary Shares\n\nAn Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc's Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.\n\n## Class X Ordinary Shares\n\nMost of our pre-incorporation partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. An Accenture plc Class X ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A Class X ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.\n\n## Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares\n\n## Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.

      "question": "How has IBM's emphasis on client relationships and trust as a competitive differentiator evolved across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year progression indicate about its strategic positioning in the hybrid cloud and AI market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM emphasized client relationships and trust as part of a broader competitive strategy that included embedding AI and cloud into offerings and modernizing platforms. In 2023, the company reinforced this by highlighting its deep incumbency with enterprises and a strong focus on innovation as key differentiators tied to client trust. By 2024, IBM expanded its strategic partnerships (e.g., adding Palo Alto Networks) and continued to position client relationships and trust as central to delivering business value, especially in the context of hybrid cloud and AI solutions. This shows a consistent but increasingly nuanced strategic emphasis on trust as a foundational element for client engagement and competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.",

      "question": "How did IBM's issuance and disclosure strategy for the 0.950% Notes due 2025 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about IBM's debt management and investor communication priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed the instrument defining the rights of the holders of the 0.950% Notes due 2025 as part of its broader debt disclosures, referencing Exhibit 4.1 to Form 8-K filed May 22, 2017. In 2023, the company continued to reference the same instrument but in the context of a broader list of notes and debentures, showing consistency in documentation and disclosure practices. By 2024, the 0.950% Notes due 2025 were explicitly listed in the company's 10-K with a designated trading symbol (IBM25B), indicating active market presence and investor focus. This evolution suggests that IBM transitioned from a general disclosure approach to a more structured and market-oriented presentation of this debt instrument, aligning with its broader financing and transparency strategy.",

      "question": "What was the impact of evolving stock exchange regulations on IBM's capital structure and financing risk exposure from 2022 to 2024, and how did the company adapt its financial risk management strategies in response?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, IBM consistently highlighted its exposure to stock exchange regulations as a key risk factor influencing its capital structure and financing activities. In 2022, IBM noted that the value of its debt and equity securities was influenced by 'governmental and stock exchange regulations,' alongside interest rate volatility and exchange rate fluctuations, which could impact its ability to manage liquidity and capital markets risks. By 2023, the company emphasized how stock exchange regulations were among the external factors affecting the value of its debt securities and its ability to pay interest and repay principal, particularly in the context of liquidity risk and pension funding volatility. In 2024, IBM expanded on this exposure, linking stock exchange regulations more directly to its broader capital markets activities, including its use of derivative financial instruments and its exposure to customer credit risk on receivables. The company also indicated it employed strategies such as derivatives to manage these risks. Over the three-year period, IBM's financial risk management evolved to include more proactive monitoring of regulatory developments and increased use of hedging instruments, reflecting a growing emphasis on navigating a complex and evolving regulatory environment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities\n\nThe Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.",

Unresolved Staff Comments:\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Item 2. Properties:\n\nIBM's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31, 2021, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 52 million square feet worldwide.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, IBM's facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 11 million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled nearly 32 million square feet, of which 7 million was owned and 25 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company's cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments.\n\nContinuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations.\n\n## Item 3.

      "question": "How did AMD's revenue recognition policy for development and intellectual property (IP) licensing agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly regarding the distinction between combined development and IP arrangements versus standalone IP licenses?",
      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, AMD maintained a consistent revenue recognition policy for development and IP licensing agreements, treating combined arrangements as either single or multiple performance obligations based on the distinct nature of the license. In 2022, AMD emphasized that if the license was not distinct, it was combined with development services and recognized over time, while distinct licenses were recognized at a point in time. This approach remained unchanged in 2023 and 2024, with no variable consideration estimates in either combined or standalone IP arrangements. Despite evolving market conditions and ongoing customer arrangements, AMD did not introduce any material changes to its accounting policy for these agreements across the three-year period, indicating a stable and consistent application of revenue recognition standards.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AMD](2023) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: Introduces policy stating that combined development and IP arrangements are treated as single or multiple performance obligations based on distinctness; revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time accordingly.",
        "Hop 2: [AMD](2024) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: Reiterates identical policy as 2023, with no changes to the treatment of licensing components or standalone IP arrangements.",
        "Hop 3: [AMD](2022) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: Discloses the same policy framework, noting that combined arrangements depend on whether the license is distinct, and standalone IP licenses are recognized at a point in time."

Generally, there are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n## Development and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the prov ision of dev elopment serv ices and a license to the right  to  use  the  Company's  IP.  T hese  arrangements  are  deemed  to  be  single  or  multiple  performance  obligations  based  upon  the  nature  of  the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, ov er time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the dev elopment serv ices as a single performance obligation and recognized ov er time. If the license is distinct, rev enue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely inv olv e the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, rev enue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nThere  are  no  v ariable  consideration  estimates  associated  with  either  combined  dev elopment  and  IP  arrangements  or  for  standalone  arrangements inv olv ing either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable v alue using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserv es for its products, the  Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary  decreases  in  demand  for  its  products,  and  changes  in  technology  or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable v alue reserv es, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activ ity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. T he Company fully reserv es for inv entories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inv entory deemed obsolete. T he Company performs periodic rev iews of inv entory items to identify excess inv entories on hand by comparing onhand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activ ity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less fav orable than those projected by the Company, additional inv entory carrying v alue adjustments may be required.",

          "chunk_text": "## Custom products\n\nCustom products which are associated with the Company's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semicustom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company's satisfaction of its performance obligation.\n\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n## Development and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  the  Company  may  enter  into  arrangements  with  customers  that  combine  the  provision  of development services and a license to the right to use the Company's IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or  multiple  performance  obligations  based  upon  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  Revenue  is  recognized  upon  the transfer  of  control,  over  time  or  at  a  point  in  time,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  The  Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct  and  (ii)  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  arrangement.  If  the  license  is  not  distinct,  it  is  combined  with  the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its  patents  or  IP .  Generally,  there  are  no  performance  obligations  beyond  transferring  the  designated  license  to  the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company's standard contractual terms, which  are  typically  net  30  to  60  days.  The  Company  has  determined  that  it  does  not  have  significant  financing components in its contracts with customers.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions  about future demand  and  market  conditions. In determining excess  or obsolescence  reserves  for  its  products,  the  Company  considers  assumptions  such  as  changes  in  business  and economic  conditions,  other-than-temporary  decreases  in  demand  for  its  products,  and  changes  in  technology  or customer  requirements.  In  determining  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value  reserves,  the  Company  considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company  fully  reserves  for  inventories  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  for  inventory  deemed  obsolete.  The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  to  anticipated  usage  using  recent  historical  activity  as  well  as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.",

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to the risk of losing tax and tariff exemptions evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's increasing reliance on international operations and regulatory stability?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD's exposure to the risk of losing tax and tariff exemptions remained a consistent concern, but the context and emphasis shifted as the company's international sales increased from 65% in 2023 to 66% in 2024, indicating a growing dependence on global markets where such exemptions are critical. In 2022, the company highlighted the risk of losing exemptions as one among many regulatory and economic challenges. By 2023, the risk was reiterated with a stronger emphasis on geopolitical tensions, particularly between China and Taiwan, and the potential disruption to third-party manufacturing. In 2024, the risk was again emphasized, now within a broader context of global conflicts and regulatory changes, suggesting AMD's increasing vulnerability to shifts in international trade policy. This trend reveals that as AMD's global footprint expands, its exposure to regulatory changes\u2014especially regarding tax and tariff exemptions\u2014has become more pronounced and strategically significant.",

        "Hop 3: AMD(2022) \u2192 Tax and Tariff Exemptions: AMD listed exemption loss as a risk among other economic and legal challenges, without the same level of emphasis on geopolitical manufacturing disruption seen in later years."

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD consistently emphasized inventory protection for AIB manufacturers against price reductions, maintaining a stable policy across all three years. In 2022, AMD highlighted that AIBs play a key role in building board-level products using AMD's component-level graphics and chipset offerings, which are then sold to system integrators and retailers. By 2023, AMD reinforced this relationship and expanded on the role of system integrators, noting that they often use discrete graphics solutions to differentiate their products and add value for customers. In 2024, AMD reiterated its commitment to inventory protection for AIBs and further emphasized the importance of system integrators in responding quickly to new technologies due to their short design cycles.

Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).\n\nCustomers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers' needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers' time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.\n\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\n\nTwo customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe  focus  on  three  types  of  OEM  partners:  multi-nationals,  selected  regional  accounts  and  some  local  system integrators,  who  target  commercial  and  consumer  end  customers  of  all  sizes.  Large  multi-nationals  and  regional accounts  are  the  core  of  our  OEM  partners'  business;  however,  we  are  increasingly  focused  on  the  Value  Added Reseller  (VAR)  channel  which  resells  OEM  systems  to  the  mid-market  and  the  small  and  medium  business  (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with  their  software  and  services  solutions  into  Enterprise,  HPC  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  Customers.  Our  OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors  handle  a  wide  variety  of  products,  and  may  include  those  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our  agreements  with  distributors  protect  their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements  with  our  distributors  may  contain  standard  stock  rotation  provisions  permitting  limited  levels  of  product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers.

      "answer": "AMD's consistent reference to the 2011 Executive Incentive Plan across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings indicates that the company has maintained the same foundational executive compensation framework without introducing substantive updates or replacements over this period. The plan was originally filed as Exhibit 10.2 to AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended April 2, 2011, and was referenced identically in all three subsequent annual reports, suggesting strategic continuity in how executive incentives are structured. This lack of change implies that AMD has found the plan sufficient to align executive performance with company goals throughout a period of technological and market evolution, including major events such as the acquisition of Xilinx and shifts in semiconductor demand.",

      "question": "How has AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties evolved across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to its international operations and third-party manufacturing dependencies?",
      "answer": "AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties remained a consistent risk factor across 2022, 2023, and 2024, with increasing emphasis on geopolitical tensions and international operational complexity. In 2022, AMD cited 'difficulties in protecting our intellectual property' as part of a broader set of political, legal, and economic risks tied to its global operations. In 2023, the company expanded this risk by linking it to specific third-party manufacturing dependencies in China, Malaysia, and Taiwan, while also noting the impact of geopolitical instability between China and Taiwan on its supply chain and IP security. By 2024, AMD reiterated these concerns and added that evolving export control regulations and sanctions\u2014particularly those related to the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts\u2014could further complicate its ability to protect intellectual property across jurisdictions. The consistent mention of IP protection challenges, combined with the growing specificity around geopolitical and regulatory pressures, indicates a deepening concern over time.",

        "Hop 2: AMD(2024) \u2192 Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties: AMD reiterated IP protection difficulties, adding that evolving export controls and geopolitical conflicts (Ukraine-Russia, Israel-Hamas) could exacerbate these risks.",
        "Hop 3: AMD(2022) \u2192 Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties: AMD identified 'difficulties in protecting our intellectual property' as part of a list of international operational risks without the same level of geopolitical specificity seen in later years."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Any impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe account for certain acquisitions, including the X ilinx, Inc. (X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment.

      "question": "How did AMD's revenue recognition policy for development and IP licensing agreements evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of performance obligations and the distinction between combined arrangements versus standalone licenses?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD maintained a consistent policy for recognizing revenue from development and IP licensing agreements. In 2022, AMD stated that combined development and IP arrangements were assessed for whether they constituted a single or multiple performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time if the license was not distinct, and at a point in time if it was distinct. By 2023 and 2024, AMD reiterated the same framework, emphasizing that standalone IP licensing arrangements resulted in revenue recognized at a point in time, while combined arrangements required an evaluation of whether the licensing component was distinct\u2014both in capability and context. There was no material change in the treatment of variable consideration across the three years, with AMD consistently stating that no variable consideration estimates were associated with these arrangements. This consistency suggests a stable accounting policy despite potential shifts in business focus, such as increased emphasis on the Gaming segment in 2023 and 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AMD](2022) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: AMD evaluated combined development and IP arrangements for distinct licensing components, recognizing revenue over time or at a point in time accordingly.",
        "Hop 2: [AMD](2023) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: AMD maintained the same policy, with an emphasis on the Gaming segment, but no changes to the revenue recognition framework for IP arrangements.",
        "Hop 3: [AMD](2024) \u2192 [Development and IP Licensing Agreements]: AMD continued to apply the same distinctness evaluation for licensing components, with no variable consideration estimates, indicating policy continuity."

          "chunk_text": "## Custom products\n\nCustom products which are associated with the Company's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semicustom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company's satisfaction of its performance obligation.\n\nSales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n## Development and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  the  Company  may  enter  into  arrangements  with  customers  that  combine  the  provision  of development services and a license to the right to use the Company's IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or  multiple  performance  obligations  based  upon  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  Revenue  is  recognized  upon  the transfer  of  control,  over  time  or  at  a  point  in  time,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  arrangements.  The  Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct  and  (ii)  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  arrangement.  If  the  license  is  not  distinct,  it  is  combined  with  the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its  patents  or  IP .  Generally,  there  are  no  performance  obligations  beyond  transferring  the  designated  license  to  the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nThere are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\nCustomers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company's standard contractual terms, which  are  typically  net  30  to  60  days.  The  Company  has  determined  that  it  does  not  have  significant  financing components in its contracts with customers.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions  about future demand  and  market  conditions. In determining excess  or obsolescence  reserves  for  its  products,  the  Company  considers  assumptions  such  as  changes  in  business  and economic  conditions,  other-than-temporary  decreases  in  demand  for  its  products,  and  changes  in  technology  or customer  requirements.  In  determining  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value  reserves,  the  Company  considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company  fully  reserves  for  inventories  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  for  inventory  deemed  obsolete.  The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances  and  non-cancellable  purchase  orders  to  anticipated  usage  using  recent  historical  activity  as  well  as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.",

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment.

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

      "question": "How did AMD's strategy and relationship with AIB manufacturers evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of inventory protection policies and the role of discrete graphics solutions in market differentiation?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD consistently emphasized inventory protection for AIB manufacturers, maintaining policies that shielded them from price reductions. In 2022, AMD explicitly stated that agreements with AIBs protected their inventory against price reductions and allowed returns for products removed from the price book within 12 months of manufacturing. In 2023, the language remained consistent, with an added emphasis on the importance of timely product introductions and market competitiveness, indirectly reinforcing the need for strong AIB partnerships. By 2024, AMD reiterated the inventory protection policy but placed greater emphasis on the role of discrete graphics solutions as a means for AIBs and system integrators to differentiate their offerings in a highly competitive market. This evolution shows AMD's ongoing strategic support for AIBs, adapting to market pressures by highlighting differentiation through discrete graphics.",

          "chunk_text": "## Customers\n\nOur  microprocessor  customers  consist  primarily  of  original  equipment  manufacturers  (OEMs),  large  public  cloud service  providers,  original  design  manufacturers  (ODMs),  system  integrators  and  independent  distributors  in  both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).\n\nCustomers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers' needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers' time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.\n\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\n\nTwo customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe  focus  on  three  types  of  OEM  partners:  multi-nationals,  selected  regional  accounts  and  some  local  system integrators,  who  target  commercial  and  consumer  end  customers  of  all  sizes.  Large  multi-nationals  and  regional accounts  are  the  core  of  our  OEM  partners'  business;  however,  we  are  increasingly  focused  on  the  Value  Added Reseller  (VAR)  channel  which  resells  OEM  systems  to  the  mid-market  and  the  small  and  medium  business  (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with  their  software  and  services  solutions  into  Enterprise,  HPC  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  Customers.  Our  OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors  handle  a  wide  variety  of  products,  and  may  include  those  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our  agreements  with  distributors  protect  their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements  with  our  distributors  may  contain  standard  stock  rotation  provisions  permitting  limited  levels  of  product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.",

These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

      "question": "How did AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to its expanding international operations and increasing reliance on third-party manufacturing in politically sensitive regions?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AMD's exposure to intellectual property protection difficulties remained a consistent risk factor, but the context and scope of this risk evolved alongside AMD's growing international operations and increased reliance on third-party manufacturing in geopolitically sensitive regions. In 2022, AMD noted that foreign operations posed risks including 'difficulties in protecting our intellectual property' among other economic and political risks. By 2023, AMD expanded its risk disclosure to emphasize the impact of geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and Russia due to the Ukraine conflict, and between China and Taiwan, which directly affected its third-party wafer foundries and manufacturing partners. In 2024, AMD reiterated these concerns and added that international sales accounted for 66% of net revenue, up from 65% in 2023 and an unspecified but lower figure in 2022, highlighting a growing dependence on international markets and supply chains. The company also emphasized that geopolitical instability in regions like Ukraine, Taiwan, and the Middle East could materially affect its business, further amplifying the risk around intellectual property protection in these areas. This indicates a transforming trend where the IP protection risk became more complex and regionally concentrated over the three-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AMD](2022) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD identified IP protection challenges as part of a broader set of foreign operational risks, with no specific mention of geopolitical tensions affecting third-party manufacturing hubs.",
        "Hop 2: [AMD](2023) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD explicitly linked IP risks to geopolitical instability, especially between China and Taiwan, and noted that 65% of its revenue came from international sales, increasing exposure.",
        "Hop 3: [AMD](2024) \u2192 [Intellectual Property Protection Difficulties]: AMD further emphasized the material impact of geopolitical instability on its business, with international sales rising to 66%, and noted that disruptions in Taiwan-based manufacturing could materially affect product delivery and IP protection."

For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time.  There  may  be  conflict  or  uncertainty  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  including  public  health  issues  (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures  have,  and  will  continue  to  have,  an  effect  on  our  business  operations  and  practices.  In  addition,  many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union's general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  governments.  The  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  imposes  significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions,  delays  from  difficulties  in  obtaining  export  licenses  for  certain  technology,  tariffs  and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully  introduce  new  products  in  the  marketplace,  an  inability  to  successfully  achieve  internal  forecasts  or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those  licenses  based  on  their  future  economic  benefit  to  us.  Factors  such  as  the  life  of  the  assets,  changes  in competing  technologies,  and  changes  to  the  business  strategy  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment.  The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.",

(X ilinx), Pensando Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the prov isions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respectiv e fair v alues at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price ov er the net fair v alue of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the X ilinx, Pensando and Silo AI acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  Indefinite-liv ed intangible assets,  including  goodwill,  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  all  tangible  and  intangible  assets  including  goodwill  will  be  tested  for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates  to  the  determination  of  fair  v alue.  Subsequent  to  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  analysis,  we  monitor  for  any  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances, such as significant adv erse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achiev e internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price,  which  may  represent  an  indicator  of  impairment. A  decrease  in  the  long-term  economic  outlook  and  future  cash  flows  of  our  business  could significantly impact asset v alues and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may hav e a material adv erse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n## General Risks\n\n## Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in  China,  Malaysia and  T aiwan.  Our shipping serv ices are prov ided by third-party subcontractors.  We also hav e international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net rev enue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that international sales will  continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. T he political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and other countries and coalitions hav e issued sanctions and rev isions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and T aiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adv ersely affect deliv ery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Moreov er, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could hav e negativ e impacts on the global economy and financial markets.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's treatment of its 1.650% Notes due 2026 evolve from their initial issuance in 2022 through the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this consistency or change reveal about Oracle's short-to-intermediate term debt financing strategy?",
      "answer": "Oracle first introduced the 1.650% Notes due 2026 in its 2022 10-K filing (Exhibit 4.16), indicating the formal structuring of this debt instrument. The same note was reaffirmed in both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings (Exhibit 4.14 in 2023 and 2024), showing Oracle maintained consistent disclosure and commitment to this financing vehicle without modification. This unchanging treatment across all three years suggests Oracle's strategy around this particular debt instrument remained stable, reflecting a consistent approach to managing its capital structure with fixed-rate obligations maturing in the mid-term horizon.",

      "answer": "The 4.30% Note due 2034 was consistently referenced in Oracle's filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating its ongoing importance in the company's long-term debt structure. In 2022 (Exhibit 4.11), the note was listed alongside other long-term instruments, reaffirming Oracle\u2019s commitment to a diversified maturity profile. In 2023 and 2024 (Exhibit 4.09), the note continued to be included in the exhibit list, showing no structural changes but reinforcing its sustained presence in Oracle\u2019s capital structure. This consistent documentation suggests Oracle intended to maintain this liability as a stable component of its long-term financing strategy.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's inclusion and treatment of the 3.650% Notes due 2041 evolve across its filings in 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this progression suggest about the consistency of Oracle's long-term debt disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle's 10-K filing referenced the 3.650% Notes due 2041 as part of a list of debt instruments established via an Officers' Certificate issued March 24, 2021. In 2023, the same notes were again listed in Oracle's 10-K filing, maintaining their position among the company's registered debt instruments. In 2024, the notes were once more included in Oracle's 10-K, with no changes to the description or associated filing date. This pattern shows that Oracle consistently disclosed the 3.650% Notes due 2041 across three consecutive annual reports without any modification to their stated terms or filing history, suggesting a stable and unchanging disclosure approach for this specific debt instrument.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and structuring of its 2.300% Notes due 2028 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern indicate about its debt financing strategy?",
      "answer": "Oracle first introduced the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in 2022 as part of a broader set of debt instruments outlined in Exhibit 4.16, with terms set by an Officers' Certificate issued March 24, 2021. In 2023, Oracle expanded its debt portfolio by issuing additional structured notes, including the 4.500% Notes due 2028 under Exhibit 4.16, indicating a diversification of interest rate profiles. By 2024, Oracle maintained the same structure for the 2.300% Notes due 2028, showing consistency in referencing the March 24, 2021 certificate. This three-year pattern suggests a stable long-term debt financing strategy focused on maintaining a diversified maturity and interest rate structure across multiple fiscal years.",

      "question": "How might NVIDIA's changes in the carrying value of its 3.50% Notes Due 2040 between fiscal years 2022 and 2024 reflect its approach to long-term debt management and capital structure optimization?",
      "answer": "The carrying value of NVIDIA's 3.50% Notes Due 2040 decreased from $1,066 million in fiscal year 2022 to $851 million in fiscal year 2023, and remained stable at $1,000 million in fiscal year 2024. This fluctuation suggests NVIDIA actively managed its long-term debt profile, potentially repurchasing or refinancing portions of this instrument between 2022 and 2023, and stabilizing its position by 2024. The reduction in 2023 may reflect a strategy to reduce near-to-mid-term liabilities or take advantage of favorable market conditions, while the increase back to $1,000 million in 2024 indicates a recommitment to maintaining a portion of this long-term debt as part of its capital structure. This evolution reveals a dynamic debt management strategy aligned with NVIDIA\u2019s broader financial planning and balance sheet optimization.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's carrying value of its 3.50% Notes Due 2050 decreased from $2,147 million in fiscal year 2022 to $1,604 million in fiscal year 2023, and remained stable at $2,000 million in fiscal year 2024. This fluctuation suggests a dynamic approach to long-term debt management, with an initial reduction in carrying value possibly reflecting amortization or market interest rate adjustments, followed by stabilization in the subsequent year.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's carrying value of the 1.55% Notes Due 2028 increased from $1,200 million in fiscal year 2022 to $1,099 million in fiscal year 2023, and then rose again to $1,250 million in fiscal year 2024.

      "question": "How has NVIDIA's exposure to the 2.00% Notes Due 2031 evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this pattern suggest about the company's long-term debt management strategy amid its rapid AI-driven revenue growth?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA's exposure to the 2.00% Notes Due 2031 was $1.20 billion in 2022, decreased to $1.057 billion in 2023, and then increased again to $1.25 billion in 2024. This fluctuation suggests a dynamic debt management strategy where NVIDIA initially reduced its position in the notes, possibly to optimize capital structure or take advantage of refinancing opportunities, before increasing exposure again\u2014potentially to secure long-term capital aligned with its strategic investments in AI infrastructure and R&D. The consistent presence of this instrument across filings highlights its importance in NVIDIA's long-term financing approach.",

      "question": "How has the competitive positioning of Lumentum Holdings in NVIDIA's networking product segment evolved across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year progression indicate about NVIDIA's perception of optical interconnect competition?",
      "answer": "Lumentum Holdings remained consistently listed as a key competitor in NVIDIA\u2019s networking product category across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating sustained competitive pressure in the optical interconnect and high-performance networking space. In 2022, Lumentum was identified among competitors like Arista, Broadcom, and Cisco in providing interconnect, switch, and cable solutions. By 2023 and 2024, this listing persisted, with NVIDIA emphasizing an increasingly competitive environment driven by both existing players and evolving technologies like AI and high-performance interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand, Ethernet). The consistent mention of Lumentum across all three years, alongside NVIDIA\u2019s growing focus on AI and accelerated computing, suggests that optical module and interconnect competition has intensified in line with rising demand for data center and AI infrastructure, reinforcing Lumentum\u2019s strategic relevance in NVIDIA\u2019s competitive landscape.",

We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers  and  licensors  designing  discrete  and  integrated  GPUs,  custom  chips  and  other  accelerated computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\n- suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc.,  AMD,  Broadcom  Inc., Intel, Qualcomm  Incorporated, Renesas  Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\n- suppliers  of  interconnect,  switch  and  cable  solutions  such  as  AMD,  Applied  Optoelectronics,  Inc.,  Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe  rely  primarily  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  employee  and  third-party  nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;\n- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n- the  commercial  significance  of  our  operations  and  our  competitors'  operations  in  particular  countries  and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods.

      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 3.700% Notes due 2046 across its 10-K filings for fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating that this debt instrument remained a stable component of its capital structure throughout the period. The notes were first introduced in the 2022 filing as part of the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, and were reaffirmed in both 2023 and 2024 filings, showing no changes in terms or structure.

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of 2.000% Notes due 2023 evolve across the 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, particularly in relation to the progression of its debt maturity structure as reflected in the Supplemental Indentures filed in each period?",
      "answer": "The 2.000% Notes due 2023 were consistently referenced in the Supplemental Indentures across Microsoft's 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, indicating their ongoing inclusion in the company's debt maturity strategy. In 2022, the notes appeared in Exhibit 4.14, listed alongside other instruments issued under the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. In 2023, the same series of notes was still present in the filings under the same exhibit structure, showing no change in the underlying debt instrument but reflecting its continued relevance as the maturity year approached. By 2024, the 2.000% Notes due 2023 remained listed in Exhibit 4.14, even as the actual maturity year had passed, suggesting either a rollover of debt, a delayed maturity, or a continued disclosure requirement for recently matured obligations. This evolution reflects Microsoft's structured approach to managing debt maturities and maintaining transparency around its long-term financing activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [2.000% Notes due 2023]: The notes were listed in Exhibit 4.14 of the 2023 10-K filing, indicating they were part of the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, and were still active as of that reporting period.",
        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [2.000% Notes due 2023]: The notes remained listed in Exhibit 4.14 of the 2024 10-K filing, even though the maturity year had technically passed, suggesting a continuation of disclosure or a recent maturity requiring reporting.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2022) \u2192 [2.000% Notes due 2023]: The notes were referenced in Exhibit 4.14 of the 2022 10-K filing, showing they were part of the company\u2019s long-term debt structure well in advance of the maturity year."

      "question": "How did Microsoft's treatment of its 4.000% Notes due 2021 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, particularly in relation to supplemental indentures and the broader debt instrument structure?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's treatment of the 4.000% Notes due 2021 remained consistent across all three years, always being grouped under the Third Supplemental Indenture dated February 8, 2011. In 2022 (MSFT_10k_2022.pdf), the notes were listed in Exhibit 4.6 alongside the 2.500% Notes due 2016 and 5.300% Notes due 2041 under the same Third Supplemental Indenture. This structure was unchanged in 2023 (MSFT_10k_2023.pdf) and 2024 (MSFT_10k_2024.pdf), where the 4.000% Notes due 2021 continued to appear in Exhibit 4.6. While the specific notes due 2021 remained unchanged, Microsoft introduced new debt instruments with different maturity dates and interest rates under subsequent supplemental indentures across the years, such as the 2.375% Notes due 2023 in 2023 filings and the 2.125% Notes due 2022 in 2022 filings.",

      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 3.950% Notes due 2056 in its filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating a sustained long-term capital structure strategy. In 2022, the notes were listed as part of the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. This same description was repeated in 2023 and 2024 filings, showing no change in the terms or structure of this debt instrument over the three-year period. The consistency in referencing this long-dated note suggests Microsoft's strategic intent to maintain a stable, long-term debt profile to support its capital allocation framework.",

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of debt instruments related to the 2.125% Notes evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern reveal about the company's long-term financing strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's relationship with the 2.125% Notes due 2021 evolved as follows: In 2022, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture for the 2.125% Notes due 2021 was listed in Exhibit 4.10, indicating continued documentation of this instrument. In 2023, the same notes were referenced in Exhibit 4.1, showing consolidation or reclassification of this debt instrument within the filing structure. In 2024, the 2.125% Notes due 2021 remained in Exhibit 4.1, suggesting ongoing relevance despite their approaching maturity. This multi-year presence indicates Microsoft's strategic use of structured debt instruments, with consistent documentation and potential rollover or refinancing planning as the notes neared maturity.",

      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 3.700% Notes due 2046 across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024) within the context of its long-term debt structure, always identifying U.S. Bank National Association as the trustee under the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. The repeated inclusion of this specific note issuance across filings indicates a stable and ongoing commitment to this long-term debt instrument, with no structural or trustee changes observed over the three-year period.",

        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [3.700% Notes due 2046]: The 3.700% Notes due 2046 are again listed in the same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture with identical trustee and date details.",

      "question": "What does Microsoft's consistent disclosure of the 2.000% Notes due 2023 across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings suggest about its long-term debt management and transparency strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's consistent disclosure of the 2.000% Notes due 2023 across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings indicates a stable and transparent approach to long-term debt management. The notes were first introduced in the 2022 filing as part of the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, and were carried forward unchanged in both the 2023 and 2024 disclosures. This unaltered inclusion over three consecutive reporting periods suggests that Microsoft maintained a consistent liability structure for this instrument and prioritized clear, ongoing communication to investors and regulators regarding its long-term obligations. The persistence of the same filing details (e.g., interest rate, maturity date, trustee) across all three years reinforces a strategy of predictable financial stewardship, which can enhance investor confidence and support favorable credit ratings.",

      "question": "What does Microsoft's consistent inclusion of the 4.000% Notes due 2021 in Exhibit 4.6 across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 indicate about its long-term debt management strategy, particularly in relation to ongoing documentation updates and refinancing activity?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's inclusion of the 4.000% Notes due 2021 in Exhibit 4.6 remained consistent across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024), indicating that this debt instrument continued to be a relevant part of its capital structure documentation, even after the notes' due date in 2021. In 2022, the notes were listed alongside the 2.500% Notes due 2016 and the 5.300% Notes due 2041 in the Third Supplemental Indenture. This pattern continued in 2023 and 2024, showing no change in the composition of this particular supplemental indenture. A minor but notable change occurred in 2024 where the trustee's name was updated to 'The Bank of NewYork Mellon Trust Company, N.A.' with spacing/formatting differences, suggesting administrative maintenance rather than substantive changes. The absence of refinancing disclosures or new tranches tied to this instrument across the three years implies that Microsoft did not actively restructure this portion of its debt, maintaining it as a stable reference within its broader debt portfolio.",

        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [4.000% Notes due 2021]: Again included in Exhibit 4.6 without any changes to the composition of the Third Supplemental Indenture, showing continued reference to this instrument in Microsoft's capital structure disclosures.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [4.000% Notes due 2021]: Still listed in Exhibit 4.6 with only a minor formatting update to the trustee's name ('The Bank of NewYork Mellon Trust Company, N.A.'), suggesting administrative continuity rather than active debt restructuring."

      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 3.950% Notes due 2056 in its 10-K filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating a stable inclusion of this long-term debt instrument in its capital structure. The Notes were first disclosed in the 2022 filing as part of the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. This same disclosure remained present in both the 2023 and 2024 filings, showing no changes to the terms or status of the Notes over the three-year period. This consistency suggests that Microsoft maintained a steady long-term financing strategy, with no modifications to this particular tranche of long-term debt.",

      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 2.125% Notes due 2021 across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014indicating a stable inclusion in its debt structure. However, the associated supplemental indentures evolved slightly over time, with the 2022 filing listing it under Exhibit 4.10, while both 2023 and 2024 filings referenced it under Exhibit 4.1. This suggests a consolidation or reorganization of documentation over time, even as the underlying instrument remained consistent.",

      "question": "How did Apple's issuance of Floating Rate Notes due 2019 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this pattern indicate about the company's short-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "Apple's inclusion of Floating Rate Notes due 2019 in its debt disclosures remained consistent across 2022, 2023, and 2024, as evidenced by the repeated appearance of the May 6, 2014 Officer's Certificate referencing these notes in each year's 10-K filing. This consistency suggests that while the notes were originally issued in 2014, Apple continued to carry them on its books and disclose them as part of its ongoing debt structure throughout the three-year period. The absence of any new issuances or modifications to the Floating Rate Notes due 2019 indicates a stable, rather than active, management approach to this specific debt instrument.",

      "question": "Given that the 0.45% Notes due 2016 matured in 2016, what does Apple's continued disclosure of these notes in its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings suggest about its strategy for managing legacy debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Apple's consistent inclusion of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its disclosures across 2022, 2023, and 2024\u2014each referencing the Officer's Certificate dated May 3, 2013\u2014suggests that the company maintains transparency around historical debt instruments, even after their maturity. This pattern indicates a deliberate and consistent approach to documenting legacy obligations, possibly to ensure continuity in financial reporting and investor clarity regarding past financing activities. Despite the notes having matured well before the reporting period, Apple\u2019s repeated reference to the same documentation implies a policy of maintaining comprehensive records and disclosures for long-settled debt instruments, which may reflect a broader conservative or thorough approach to debt management and disclosure practices.",

        "Hop 2: [AAPL](2023) \u2192 [0.45% Notes due 2016]: In 2023, Apple again included the same Officer's Certificate from May 3, 2013, reaffirming the presence of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its disclosures.",
        "Hop 3: [AAPL](2024) \u2192 [0.45% Notes due 2016]: In 2024, Apple continued to reference the identical Officer's Certificate from May 3, 2013, maintaining the inclusion of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its exhibit list despite the notes having matured nearly a decade earlier."

      "question": "How did Apple's issuance of long-term debt instruments, specifically the 4.45% Notes due 2044, evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern reveal about the company's long-term capital strategy?",
      "answer": "Apple consistently referenced the 4.45% Notes due 2044 in its filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating sustained transparency and ongoing obligations tied to this long-term debt instrument. The consistent inclusion of the Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014, which includes the 4.45% Notes due 2044, across all three years suggests that Apple maintained this liability without redemption or restructuring during the observed period. This pattern implies a strategic decision to retain long-term debt at a fixed rate, likely to fund strategic initiatives or maintain financial flexibility amid fluctuating interest rate environments.",

        "Hop 2: [AAPL](2023) \u2192 [4.45% Notes due 2044]: In 2023, Apple again referenced the same Officer's Certificate from May 6, 2014, showing no changes to the 4.45% Notes due 2044, suggesting continued presence of this debt instrument in its capital structure.",
        "Hop 3: [AAPL](2024) \u2192 [4.45% Notes due 2044]: In 2024, Apple maintained the same disclosure regarding the 4.45% Notes due 2044, reaffirming the instrument's persistence in its long-term debt portfolio without any indication of early redemption or restructuring."

      "question": "How did Apple's continued inclusion of the Officer's Certificate related to the 1.05% Notes due 2017 in its 10-K filings across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 reflect its documentation retention practices for matured debt instruments, and what does this imply about its approach to maintaining historical capital structure disclosures?",
      "answer": "Apple consistently included the Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014, related to the 1.05% Notes due 2017 in its 10-K filings for fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, despite the notes having matured well before this period. This reflects a documentation retention and disclosure strategy that emphasizes completeness and historical continuity in capital structure reporting. The inclusion of this certificate across all three years indicates that Apple maintains and discloses records of past debt issuances as part of its ongoing SEC filings, even when those instruments are no longer outstanding. This practice suggests a deliberate approach to preserving the full historical context of its debt financing activities for investor and regulatory transparency.",

      "question": "How did Apple's disclosure of its 2.40% Notes due 2023 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's debt maturity management strategy as the notes approached their due date?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Apple listed the 2.40% Notes due 2023 as part of its outstanding debt instruments in its exhibit filings, indicating ongoing acknowledgment of the obligation. In 2023, the company continued to reference the same notes, showing no early retirement or restructuring action despite the approaching maturity. By 2024, the 2.40% Notes due 2023 were no longer listed in the exhibits, suggesting that Apple likely fulfilled or retired the obligation in line with its 2023 due date. This progression indicates a strategy of holding debt until maturity rather than refinancing or repurchasing it early.",

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Such governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

      "question": "How did QCOM's focus on Human Capital Advancements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of leadership diversity goals, employee engagement programs, and the integration of human capital metrics into executive compensation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, QCOM set specific 2025 goals for increasing women and underrepresented minorities (URM) in leadership roles by 15% and overall URM representation by 20%, while also linking progress on human capital to executive bonuses via a 0.9\u20131.1 performance modifier. By 2023, QCOM maintained its focus on diversity and inclusion, continuing its participation in initiatives like the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition and maintaining the same executive compensation modifier structure. In 2024, QCOM expanded its recognition for inclusive workplace practices, including being named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for ten consecutive years, and continued to emphasize health, wellness, and talent development programs. Despite consistent emphasis on human capital, the specific diversity targets from 2022 remained unchanged in 2024, suggesting steady but unaccelerated progress toward those goals.",

According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

      "question": "What was the significance of Microsoft's continued reference to the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, particularly in relation to the 3.700% Notes due 2046, and how does this reflect on the company's long-term debt structure and consistency in financial obligations?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings all reference the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, which governs the 3.700% Notes due 2046. This consistent inclusion across three consecutive annual reports indicates that the terms of this long-term debt instrument remained in effect and were still relevant to the company's capital structure throughout this period. The 3.700% Notes due 2046 are part of a broader set of debt instruments governed under the base Indenture dated May 18, 2009, and subsequent supplemental indentures, showing a layered and structured approach to long-term financing. The fact that the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture is repeatedly referenced suggests that the obligations tied to the 2046 Notes were active and ongoing, with no material amendments or retirements during this time. This reflects a deliberate and stable long-term debt management strategy, where Microsoft maintains long-dated liabilities to support multi-decade financial planning.",

        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [3.700% Notes due 2046]: The 2023 filing continues to reference the same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016, showing no changes to the structure or governance of the 3.700% Notes due 2046.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [3.700% Notes due 2046]: The 2024 filing again includes the same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture for the 3.700% Notes due 2046, confirming ongoing adherence to the original terms and no early redemption or restructuring during the 3-year period."

      "question": "How did Microsoft's issuance of 2.000% Notes due 2023 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern indicate about the company's debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 2.000% Notes due 2023 in its filings across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014as part of the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated August 8, 2016. The continued inclusion of this debt instrument in successive filings indicates that Microsoft maintained this obligation throughout the period and did not retire or refinance it before its maturity in 2023. The consistency in referencing the same indenture agreement suggests a stable and long-term approach to debt management, relying on established structures rather than frequent refinancing.",

        "Hop 2: [MSFT](2023) \u2192 [2.000% Notes due 2023]: In 2023, Microsoft again referenced the same 2.000% Notes due 2023 under the same Eleventh Supplemental Indenture in Exhibit 4.14, confirming the note's continued existence.",
        "Hop 3: [MSFT](2024) \u2192 [2.000% Notes due 2023]: In 2024, Microsoft still included the 2.000% Notes due 2023 in its filings, again citing Exhibit 4.14 and the August 8, 2016, Eleventh Supplemental Indenture, indicating no change in structure or retirement prior to maturity."

      "question": "How did Microsoft's reference to the 4.000% Notes due 2021 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this reveal about the ongoing relevance of this debt instrument in the company's capital structure?",
      "answer": "Microsoft consistently referenced the 4.000% Notes due 2021 in its 10-K filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating that the Notes remained a part of its structured debt disclosures despite their maturity date having passed. This suggests that the Notes were likely still outstanding or held ongoing legal or structural relevance in the context of Microsoft's broader debt framework, such as covenants or indentures that continued to apply. The consistent inclusion of the Notes in Exhibit 4.6 across all three years shows that the company maintained a formal linkage to this instrument, even post-maturity, likely for transparency and continuity in investor understanding.",

The Eleventh Supplemental Indenture related to these notes was listed in each year\u2019s exhibit, dated August 8, 2016. This consistent disclosure suggests that the 3.950% Notes due 2056 remained a stable component of Microsoft\u2019s long-term financing strategy over the three-year period, reflecting a sustained approach to long-duration debt financing.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's treatment of the 2.875% Notes due 2031 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this consistent positioning as Exhibit 4.14 reveal about the company's capital structure management and debt strategy over time?",
      "answer": "The 2.875% Notes due 2031 were consistently positioned as Exhibit 4.14 in Oracle's 10-K filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024, with no modifications to the terms of the Notes indicated in any of the filings. This consistent treatment across all three years reveals a stable approach to capital structure management, with Oracle maintaining the same debt instrument positioning without alteration. The Notes were originally established under an Officers' Certificate issued on March 24, 2021, and this structure remained unchanged through subsequent filings. The lack of modifications to the Notes' terms or exhibit positioning suggests Oracle maintained a consistent long-term debt strategy during this period, prioritizing stability in its capital structure despite potential market fluctuations.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and introduction of the 1.650% Notes due 2026 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this pattern indicate about Oracle's broader debt financing strategy during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle first introduced the 1.650% Notes due 2026 as part of a broader set of debt instruments outlined in an exhibit filed with its 10-K. In 2023 and 2024, Oracle continued to reference the 1.650% Notes due 2026 in its disclosures, maintaining consistency in the structure and presentation of these notes alongside newer debt instruments. This pattern suggests Oracle maintained a stable approach to its debt portfolio, preserving lower-yield instruments like the 1.650% Notes while introducing higher-yielding notes in later years to adapt to changing market conditions.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's inclusion of the 4.30% Note due 2034 in its debt instrument disclosures evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this consistent inclusion indicate about Oracle's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "The 4.30% Note due 2034 was consistently included in Oracle's debt instrument disclosures across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, as evidenced by its appearance in Exhibit 4.11 of the 2022 10-K filing (which references the July 8, 2014 filing that originally documented the note), and its continued inclusion in Exhibit 4.09 of both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings. This consistent inclusion over three years indicates that Oracle has maintained this long-term debt instrument as part of its capital structure strategy, suggesting a stable approach to long-term financing obligations. The note's persistent presence in disclosures also implies ongoing relevance to Oracle's financial planning and investor transparency.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and introduction of the 3.650% Notes due 2041 evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern indicate about Oracle's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle issued the 3.650% Notes due 2041 as part of a broader set of debt instruments, including other long-term notes such as the 3.600% Notes due 2040 and 3.850% Notes due 2060. In 2023, Oracle continued to reference the 3.650% Notes due 2041, indicating ongoing inclusion in its capital structure and debt disclosures. By 2024, Oracle again included the 3.650% Notes due 2041 in its exhibit list, reaffirming its commitment to this long-term debt instrument alongside newer issuances like the 5.550% Notes due 2053. This 3-year continuity shows Oracle's consistent reliance on long-term fixed-rate debt to finance strategic initiatives and maintain financial flexibility.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's issuance and structuring of its 2.300% Notes due 2028 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern reveal about Oracle's broader debt financing strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Oracle introduced the 2.300% Notes due 2028 as part of a broader issuance that included other fixed-rate notes, indicating a strategic effort to diversify its debt portfolio with mid- to long-term instruments. In 2023, Oracle continued to reference the 2.300% Notes due 2028 within its capital structure, reaffirming its commitment to this instrument as a stable component of its financing. By 2024, Oracle maintained the inclusion of the 2.300% Notes due 2028 in its disclosures, while also introducing newer notes with higher interest rates (e.g., 4.500% Notes due 2028), suggesting a shift toward more expensive financing amid potentially rising interest rates. This 3-year pattern reveals Oracle's consistent reliance on fixed-rate debt for long-term capital needs, while also adapting to evolving market conditions by adjusting the terms and yields of new issuances.",

      "question": "How has Qualcomm's strategic and financial positioning around 5G evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of licensing revenue expectations, expansion into automotive and IoT, and exposure to geopolitical risks affecting 5G product sales?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm emphasized the transformative potential of 5G across automotive and IoT, projecting that 60% of new vehicles produced in 2028 would feature 5G connectivity and forecasting over 27 billion IoT devices by 2026. Licensing revenue was tied to multimode devices incorporating 3G/4G/5G, with per-unit royalties based on device sales. By 2023, Qualcomm faced direct geopolitical impacts as the U.S. revoked its license to sell 4G and certain other chips to Huawei, costing approximately $560 million in product revenue in fiscal 2024. Despite this, the company continued investing in 5G as a foundational technology, expecting it to underpin future growth. In 2024, Qualcomm reinforced its leadership in OFDMA-based 5G intellectual property and maintained a licensing model covering multimode devices, while also expanding strategic investments in 5G-enabled sectors like automotive and AI through Qualcomm Ventures. However, the Huawei ban and broader U.S.-China trade tensions continued to pose material risks to revenue and market access.",

        "Hop 1: QCOM(2023) \u2192 5G Technologies: Faced a $560M revenue loss from Huawei due to revoked export licenses for 4G and other products, signaling growing geopolitical constraints on 5G-related product sales.",
        "Hop 2: QCOM(2024) \u2192 5G Technologies: Maintained leadership in 5G intellectual property and licensing, with per-unit royalties tied to multimode devices, and expanded strategic investments in 5G applications across automotive, AI, and IoT.",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Such governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. '\n\nQSI Segment. QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including but not limited to 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business and our cloud computing processing initiative. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality.

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

      "question": "How did Qualcomm's human capital advancement goals and their linkage to executive compensation evolve from fiscal 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of diversity targets and bonus adjustment mechanisms?",
      "answer": "From fiscal 2022 to 2024, Qualcomm maintained consistent executive compensation linkage to human capital advancements, with a non-financial performance modifier adjusting executive bonuses by a factor of 0.9 to 1.1 based on progress. However, the company's diversity goals saw quantitative evolution: in 2022, specific 2025 goals were set to increase women in leadership by 15%, underrepresented minorities (URM) in leadership by 15%, and overall URM representation by 20%. These goals were reaffirmed in 2023 and 2024, with no changes to the targets, but with increased emphasis on initiatives like the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition aiming to double degrees for underrepresented groups by 2025. This shows a stable strategic framework with sustained incentive alignment and expanding external partnerships to achieve long-term diversity outcomes.",

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 13.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 13 to 15.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 15 to 16.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our broad range of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we are optimizing our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations, shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into our offerings while building new solutions and modernizing our existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nWe differentiate from other providers, as our breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients.

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-TabulatingRecording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 12.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 12 to 14.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 14 to 15.\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\n\nWe proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers, global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients' complex business challenges while accelerating growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others.\n\nCompanies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new competitors.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nOur breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong focus on innovation. All of these attributes position IBM for accelerated growth now and prepare us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed the 1.250% Notes due 2027 as part of its exhibit list, indicating that the instrument defining the rights of holders was incorporated by reference from a filing made on January 30, 2019. In 2023, the company reaffirmed this disclosure and grouped the 1.250% Notes due 2027 with other long-term instruments, suggesting ongoing relevance in its capital structure. By 2024, the 1.250% Notes due 2027 were formally listed as a registered security on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol IBM27B, indicating active market participation and liquidity. This progression from internal disclosure to public listing suggests that IBM strategically positioned this instrument as a key part of its long-term debt financing, likely to attract a broader investor base and maintain flexibility in capital markets.",

      "question": "How has IBM's disclosure of the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 evolved across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, particularly in terms of exhibit references and the broader context of other debt instruments listed alongside it?",
      "answer": "Across the 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, IBM consistently referenced the 6.50% Debentures due 2028 under Exhibit 2 to Form 8-K filed on January 8, 1998. However, the context in which it was disclosed evolved slightly: in 2022, it was listed among several short-term notes (e.g., 1.250% Notes due 2023, 2.875% Notes due 2022), emphasizing near-term obligations. In 2023 and 2024, the debenture was grouped with longer-dated instruments like the 5.875% Debentures due 2032 and 7.125% Debentures due 2096, suggesting a shift in focus toward IBM's long-term debt structure. This pattern indicates a consistent legal reference but a changing narrative around IBM's broader debt maturity profile.",

      "question": "How did IBM's exposure to stock exchange regulations evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to its debt and equity securities, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about its capital market risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM highlighted its dependence on stock exchange regulations in the context of debt and equity securities, noting that fluctuations in value were influenced by exchange controls, governmental policies, and regulations over which the company had little control. In 2023, the company reiterated this dependency, emphasizing that its ability to manage these risks was tied to its broader business operations and risk factors. By 2024, IBM was explicitly subject to these regulations in a more detailed context, with expanded disclosures around financing risks, liquidity conditions, and creditworthiness of clients, indicating a deepening awareness and formalization of regulatory exposure. This 3-year trajectory shows an increasing acknowledgment of regulatory complexity and a strategic shift toward more transparent and structured risk disclosures.",

        "Hop 1: [IBM](2022) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: IBM's debt and equity securities were noted to be affected by stock exchange regulations, exchange controls, and other external factors, over which the company had little control.",
        "Hop 2: [IBM](2023) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: Reiterated dependency on stock exchange regulations, tying them to broader risk factors including credit risk and liquidity, especially in the context of the Kyndryl spin-off and its potential tax implications.",
        "Hop 3: [IBM](2024) \u2192 [Stock Exchange Regulations]: IBM was now explicitly subject to stock exchange regulations in a more detailed financial risk framework, including impacts on liquidity, client credit risk, and pension funding disclosures."

The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Item 2. Properties:\n\nIBM's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31, 2021, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 52 million square feet worldwide.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, IBM's facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 11 million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled nearly 32 million square feet, of which 7 million was owned and 25 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company's cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments.\n\nContinuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations.\n\n## Item 3.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities\n\nThe Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control.

      "question": "How did Apple's inclusion of Floating Rate Notes due 2019 in its filings change across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this pattern suggest about its long-term debt disclosure strategy?",
      "answer": "Apple consistently included the Floating Rate Notes due 2019 in its filings across all three fiscal years (2022, 2023, and 2024), as evidenced by the repeated appearance of the Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014, in each filing. This consistent inclusion suggests a deliberate strategy to maintain transparency around historical debt instruments, regardless of their current outstanding status.

      "question": "How does Apple's consistent inclusion of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its 10-K filings from 2022 through 2024 reflect its approach to managing fixed-rate debt maturities and capital structure stability?",
      "answer": "Apple's inclusion of the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in its 10-K filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024 indicates a consistent and transparent approach to disclosing its fixed-rate debt obligations, even for notes with earlier maturity dates. This consistent treatment suggests that Apple maintains a structured capital management strategy, prioritizing clarity in debt composition and long-term financial planning. While the 0.45% Notes due 2016 are no longer outstanding, their repeated documentation across filings reflects Apple's emphasis on comprehensive debt disclosure and historical tracking of its capital structure evolution.",

        "Hop 2: [AAPL](2024) \u2192 [0.45% Notes due 2016]: The 0.45% Notes due 2016 are again referenced in the 2024 10-K filing under the same Officer's Certificate, showing ongoing inclusion in financial disclosures despite the notes' maturity.",
        "Hop 3: [AAPL](2022) \u2192 [0.45% Notes due 2016]: In the 2022 10-K filing, Apple also lists the 0.45% Notes due 2016 in the Officer's Certificate from May 3, 2013, demonstrating a pattern of consistent disclosure of this instrument across multiple reporting periods."

      "answer": "Apple first disclosed the 4.45% Notes due 2044 in its 2014 Officer's Certificate, which was incorporated by reference in filings across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024). While the core structure of the 4.45% Notes due 2044 remained unchanged, Apple consistently maintained this long-term debt instrument as part of its capital structure over the three-year period. The persistent inclusion of these notes in each year's disclosures indicates a stable, long-term financing strategy focused on maintaining diversified debt maturities. Apple did not issue new tranches or amend the terms of the 4.45% Notes during this time, suggesting confidence in its long-term financial planning and capital structure management.",

      "question": "How did Apple's disclosure of the 1.05% Notes due 2017 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this repeated inclusion suggest about the company's debt management practices for this instrument?",
      "answer": "Apple first disclosed the 1.05% Notes due 2017 in its 2022 10-K filing, where it was included as part of the Officer's Certificate dated May 6, 2014 (filed as Exhibit 4.4). The same instrument was again disclosed in both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, maintaining its presence as a listed debt instrument despite its maturity in 2017. This repeated inclusion of the 1.05% Notes due 2017 across filings post-maturity suggests that Apple may have either rolled over the debt into a new instrument or maintained it in its capital structure in some form, indicating a continuity in its debt management approach for this obligation. The persistence of this specific note in disclosures over multiple years, even after its due date, implies a deliberate and consistent reporting practice by Apple regarding this financial liability.",

      "question": "What does Apple's consistent disclosure of the 2.40% Notes due 2023 in its 10-K filings for fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 indicate about its approach to managing near-term debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Apple's consistent inclusion of the 2.40% Notes due 2023 in all three annual 10-K filings (2022, 2023, and 2024) indicates a deliberate and transparent approach to managing near-term debt obligations. The notes were first disclosed in the 2022 filing, reaffirmed in 2023, and remained part of the disclosed debt structure in 2024, showing that Apple maintained this liability across multiple fiscal years without early redemption or restructuring. This consistency suggests a strategic decision to preserve liquidity by honoring the maturity schedule rather than accelerating repayment, aligning with a broader capital management strategy that balances debt servicing with operational and strategic investment needs.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel introduced PowerVia as part of its future packaging and process technology roadmap, positioning it as an industry-first backside power delivery solution aimed at optimizing signal transmission by eliminating front-side power routing. By 2023, Intel had solidified its roadmap, stating that PowerVia would be introduced with the Intel 20A process node and would deliver up to a 15% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 3, alongside RibbonFET. In 2024, Intel disclosed that PowerVia was part of the Intel 18A process node (the successor to Intel 20A), which was expected to enter high-volume manufacturing in 2025, indicating a shift in focus to a more refined version of the technology. This evolution shows a transition from conceptual introduction to a mature, production-ready innovation integrated into Intel's advanced node offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## New CEO and leadership team changes\n\nOur new CEO Pat Gelsinger joined Intel on February 15, 2021 and made several senior leadership changes throughout the year. We also named our new CFO David Zinsner in January 2022. Mr. Gelsinger returns to Intel, where he previously spent 30 years of his career, learned at the feet of Intel's founders, and served as our first Chief Technology Officer.\n\n## IDM 2.0\n\nOn March 23, 2021, we announced our \"IDM 2.0\" strategy, the next evolution of our IDM model. Our IDM 2.0 strategy combines our internal factory network, strategic use of external foundries, and our new IFS business to position us to drive technology and product leadership. To accelerate this strategy, we announced plans to invest $20 billion to build two new fabs in Arizona, which we broke ground on in September, and we recently announced plans to invest more than $20 billion in the construction of two new leading-edge fabs in Ohio. We also announced approximately $10.5 billion total investment to equip our Rio Rancho, New Mexico and Malaysia sites for advanced packaging manufacturing. In August, the US Department of Defense announced that IFS will lead the first phase of its multi-phase RAMP-C program to facilitate the use of a domestic commercial foundry infrastructure.\n\n## Process and packaging technology roadmaps\n\nAt the Intel Accelerated event in July 2021, we provided an update on our manufacturing process and packaging technology roadmaps. We introduced future nodes, including Intel 3 and Intel 20A, and discussed future process and packaging technologies, such as our PowerVia, RibbonFET, Foveros Omni, and Foveros Direct technologies. As part of the update, we also introduced a new naming structure for our manufacturing process nodes, which includes the name changes summarized in \"Key Terms\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 12th Gen Intel  Core\u2122 processors \u00ae\n\nWe announced the 12th Gen Intel Core processor family (Alder Lake), the first on the Intel 7 process, with real-world performance for enthusiast gamers and professional creators. Alder Lake is the first processor based on our performance hybrid architecture featuring a combination of Performance-cores, the highest performing CPU cores Intel has built, and Efficient-cores designed for scalable multi-threaded workload performance.\n\n## Ice Lake Server processors\n\nWe launched the 3rd Gen Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable CPU (Ice Lake), which boasts up to 40 cores and delivers a significant increase in performance, on average, compared to the previous generation. The chips include a set of built-in security features, cryptographic acceleration, and AI.\n\n## 5G network products\n\nWe also introduced a broad, data-centric portfolio for 5G network infrastructure, including an SoC for wireless base stations, structured ASICs for 5G network acceleration, and a 5G network-optimized Ethernet NIC.\n\n## Intel  Arc\u2122 graphics \u00ae\n\nWe revealed the brand for our upcoming consumer high-performance graphics products: Intel Arc. The Arc brand will cover hardware, software, and services, and will span multiple hardware generations, with the first generation discrete GPU (Alchemist) based on the Xe HPG microarchitecture and shipping to OEMs in Q1 2022.\n\n## First closing of divestiture of NAND memory business\n\nOn December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end, we completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory business to SK hynix, Inc. (SK hynix). We intend to invest transaction proceeds to deliver leadership products and advance our long-term growth priorities.\n\nFundamentals of Our Business",

          "chunk_text": "- Intel 4, our first EUV  lithography  node, deliv ers significant density  scaling and approx imately  20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n- Intel 3, our second EUV  lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel's X eon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.\n- Intel 18A  is our nex t generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A  is offered to ex ternal foundry  customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A , in 2025.\n- Intel 14A , our third adv anced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A.\n\n## IP Rights\n\nWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.\n\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly  in countries that prov ide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmoniz ed international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.\n\n## Manufacturing Capital\n\nWe are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.\n\n## Process Technology\n\nOur technology development group, with its R&amp;D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before high-volume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and siz e to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

      "question": "How did Intel's use of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan evolve from 2022 through 2024 in structuring performance-based restricted stock unit (RSU) grants to executives?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel utilized the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan for strategic growth performance-based RSUs granted to executives on or after February 1, 2019, as evidenced by the restricted stock unit grant agreement listed in the 2022 10-K filing. In 2023, the company continued to use the same plan for RSUs with performance-based conditions, including separate agreements for grandfathered and non-grandfathered executives, as detailed in the 2023 10-K filing. By 2024, the company reaffirmed its reliance on the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective May 11, 2023, and filed an S-8 registration on September 26, 2023, to support continued use of the plan for equity grants. This demonstrates a consistent strategic focus on performance-based compensation aligned with long-term corporate objectives across the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did Intel's investment in advanced packaging technologies evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression reveal about the company's ability to execute its disaggregated design strategy and compete in the AI-driven semiconductor market?",
      "answer": "Intel's investment in advanced packaging technologies showed a complex evolution from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, the company acknowledged significant challenges in implementing its disaggregated design approach using advanced packaging technologies, noting that delays or failures could adversely affect its ability to introduce competitive products. By 2023, Intel had made concrete progress, demonstrating the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) standard in silicon and positioning its advanced packaging capabilities as a unique advantage in the AI-driven market. However, in 2024, despite investing $16.5 billion in R&D (including packaging technologies), Intel recorded $3.1 billion in charges related to non-cash impairments and accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, including those tied to the Intel 7 process node, indicating ongoing execution risks and financial pressures in scaling advanced packaging technologies. This trajectory reveals persistent execution challenges and the high financial stakes in competing for leadership in advanced packaging for AI applications.",

          "chunk_text": "Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n\nWe invest significantly in R&amp;D, and to the extent our R&amp;D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology).

          "chunk_text": "Consumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity, processing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social networking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and more. 5G enables these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and interactive.\n\nTransforming Other Industries: Automotive. According to analyst data, more than 70% of new vehicles produced in 2028 are projected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 60% of cellular connected vehicles featuring 5G connectivity. By comparison, 60% of vehicles produced in 2021 had embedded cellular connectivity, with 5G connectivity expected to ramp in 2023 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nDigitalization of the automotive cockpit continues to transform the in-vehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers respond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are helping automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle with over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development of a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. High-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are being used to improve vehicles with advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the progression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 19% of new vehicles sold globally in 2025 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 9% of new vehicles sold globally in 2022 (Strategy Analytics, October 2022).\n\nTransforming Other Industries: IoT. Demand for connected devices beyond smartphones continued to grow across consumer, edge networking and industrial applications in fiscal 2022, in part due to the expanded use cases enabled by 5G technologies. The installed base of IoT devices, which includes everything from wearables to industrial handhelds to gateways, is projected to more than double between 2022 and 2026 to over 27 billion (IoT Analytics, October 2022). The growth in IoT devices is an important catalyst in driving digital transformation across industries.\n\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products continue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and personal computers), connected audio (e.g., wireless earbuds, speakers and soundbars), wearables (e.g., smart watches), XR devices (e.g., VR headsets and AR glasses) and others (e.g., camera and video collaboration, exercise equipment and home appliances). This is enabling new services, applications and experiences.\n\nEdge Networking. Growth in demand for connected devices, the transition to hybrid work environments and advances in wireless technology are driving increased demand for edge networking products (including mobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users with the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional 'last-mile' wired broadband connections. Additionally, advancements in WiFi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-Fi 6 and 6E access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the increased number of connected devices at home and at work.\n\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing and on-device AI along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail, transportation, logistics, mining and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and services, manufacturing processes and more, which should help to transform, optimize and innovate their business.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nThe worldwide demand for wireless devices, data services and applications requires continuous innovation to improve the user experiences, support new services, increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and allow for dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. We have a long history of investing heavily in research and development and have developed foundational technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA, that help drive the continued evolution of the wireless industry. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred licensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\n\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology and provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over earlier technologies (e.g., 2G technology). CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies, which comprise the majority of total cellular connections today.",

          "chunk_text": "- Intel 4, our first EUV  lithography  node, deliv ers significant density  scaling and approx imately  20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n- Intel 3, our second EUV  lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel's X eon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.\n- Intel 18A  is our nex t generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A  is offered to ex ternal foundry  customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A , in 2025.\n- Intel 14A , our third adv anced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A.\n\n## IP Rights\n\nWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.\n\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly  in countries that prov ide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmoniz ed international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.\n\n## Manufacturing Capital\n\nWe are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.\n\n## Process Technology\n\nOur technology development group, with its R&amp;D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before high-volume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and siz e to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

      "question": "How did Intel's strategic positioning and execution risks related to Advanced Packaging Technologies evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of R&D investment, manufacturing complexity, and financial impact?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Intel's strategic positioning around Advanced Packaging Technologies shifted from a focus on competitive differentiation through disaggregated design and R&D investment, to active production and ecosystem development in 2023, and by 2024, to growing execution risks and financial strain tied to delays, impairments, and underutilized capacity. R&D investment remained consistently high\u2014$17.5B in 2022, $16.0B in 2023, and $16.5B in 2024\u2014yet delays in product rollouts and process node execution, such as the Intel 7 node impairment of $3.1B in 2024, revealed increasing financial vulnerability. Despite efforts to build a systems-of-chips approach and promote standards like UCIe (demonstrated in 2023), Intel faced mounting pressure from high fixed costs, customer hesitancy, and construction delays across global facilities, all of which undermined the financial return on its advanced packaging strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [INTC](2022) \u2192 [Advanced Packaging Technologies]: Intel acknowledged the complexity and risk of implementing advanced packaging in disaggregated chip designs, citing delays in process technologies like Intel 4 and the high R&D costs ($17.5B in 2022) required to maintain competitiveness.",
        "Hop 2: [INTC](2023) \u2192 [Advanced Packaging Technologies]: Intel began actively producing using advanced packaging technologies, positioning them as a key differentiator in its foundry offering (IFS) and demonstrating UCIe in silicon, while investing $16.0B in R&D to support this shift.",
        "Hop 3: [INTC](2024) \u2192 [Advanced Packaging Technologies]: Execution risks materialized into financial impacts, including a $3.1B impairment charge for Intel 7 node assets, delays in global manufacturing projects, and rising fixed costs that strained margins and credit outlook."

          "chunk_text": "Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n\nWe invest significantly in R&amp;D, and to the extent our R&amp;D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

      "answer": "Intel's strategy for PowerVia evolved significantly from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, Intel introduced PowerVia as part of its future roadmap alongside RibbonFET, signaling its intent to innovate in backside power delivery. By 2023, PowerVia was positioned as a key breakthrough technology within the Intel 20A node, designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating front-side power routing. In 2024, Intel disclosed that it had canceled the productization of Intel 20A in favor of Intel 18A, which integrates PowerVia for commercial high-volume production starting in 2025. This shows a strategic pivot from concept (2022) to technical integration (2023) to commercial deployment (2024), indicating Intel's commitment to delivering backside power delivery at scale.",

The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.\n- Intel 3, our second EUV  lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel's X eon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.\n- Intel 18A  is our nex t generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A  is offered to ex ternal foundry  customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A , in 2025.\n- Intel 14A , our third adv anced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A.\n\n## IP Rights\n\nWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.\n\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. A s we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties.\n\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\n\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly  in countries that prov ide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmoniz ed international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.\n\n## Manufacturing Capital\n\nWe are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.\n\n## Process Technology\n\nOur technology development group, with its R&amp;D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before high-volume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and siz e to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV  lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A  process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in A rizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV  lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A  process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A , that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.\n\nOur Capital\n\n8",

      "question": "How did Intel's strategic positioning and execution challenges related to its advanced packaging technologies evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in light of delays, capital constraints, and the introduction of disaggregated design approaches?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel acknowledged the complexity and risk associated with implementing advanced packaging technologies as part of its disaggregated design approach, noting that delays in manufacturing process technologies like Intel 4 (formerly 7nm) could hinder the timely introduction of competitive products. By 2023, Intel emphasized its strategic advantage in advanced packaging, including 2D and 2.5D/3D solutions, and demonstrated progress with the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) standard, positioning it as a key differentiator in the foundry market. However, in 2024, the company faced significant execution challenges, including delays in manufacturing projects in multiple geographies and a $3.1 billion impairment charge tied to underutilized manufacturing assets, particularly for the Intel 7 node, which highlighted the risks in scaling advanced packaging capabilities amid constrained capital and uncertain customer demand.",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n\nWe invest significantly in R&amp;D, and to the extent our R&amp;D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments.

For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Accenture had an aggregate available authorization of $3.13 billion for share purchases and redemptions. By fiscal 2024, this available authorization had decreased to $2.69 billion, despite an additional $4.0 billion in new share repurchase authority approved in September 2024, bringing total outstanding authority to $6.69 billion. During fiscal 2024 alone, Accenture purchased over $605 million worth of Class A ordinary shares under its open-market program. The 2023 filing mirrors the 2024 disclosures regarding the ongoing share purchase program and total authorized amounts, indicating consistent execution over the two years. This trend suggests a sustained but measured capital return strategy focused on strategic share repurchases while maintaining flexibility for future buybacks.",

Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc's Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.\n\n## Class X Ordinary Shares\n\nMost of our pre-incorporation partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. An Accenture plc Class X ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A Class X ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.\n\n## Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares\n\n## Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.

Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. We may, at our option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.

In 2022, the company emphasized the need to 'introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments' as cloud and as-a-service solutions began displacing traditional services. By 2023, Accenture had expanded its response to include 'strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies' to support its innovation-driven growth strategy. In 2024, the company deepened its focus on AI-driven services, noting it was 'making significant investments in AI and continuing to incur significant development and operational costs' to develop and deploy AI services that require new pricing frameworks.

          "chunk_text": "Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud and as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead",

A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",
