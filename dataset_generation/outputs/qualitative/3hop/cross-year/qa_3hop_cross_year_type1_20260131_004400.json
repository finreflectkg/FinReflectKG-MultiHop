      "question": "How did Duke Energy's application of the AFS classification for debt investments evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the stability of their long-term investment strategy in debt securities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas disclosed that its debt investments were classified as AFS, indicating a strategic intent to hold these securities for an extended period while recognizing changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. By 2024, Duke Energy Indiana maintained the same AFS classification for debt investments, showing consistency in their accounting treatment. Additionally, Duke Energy Florida reported receiving reimbursements from the NDTF for decommissioning costs, while realized gains and losses from AFS securities remained immaterial across 2022\u20132024. This suggests that the company's long-term investment strategy in debt securities remained stable, with no material changes in classification or realized impacts over time.",

By 2023, this capacity decreased slightly to 578 MW, reflecting a shift in fuel mix toward coal/gas dual-fuel operations. This change aligns with Duke Energy Indiana's broader coal sourcing strategy, which relies on long-term contracts expiring between 2024 and 2027, with expectations to renew or replace these contracts as they expire. The reduction in coal-only capacity suggests a strategic move to increase fuel flexibility, likely in response to market conditions and environmental considerations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (SO) reported Garland Solar Storage as a project under construction with a battery energy storage system capacity of 88 MW in Kern County, CA, with expected commercial operation dates (COD) spanning September 2021 through early 2022. By 2023, the same facility was listed as completed, still with an 88 MW battery energy storage capacity, and the COD was confirmed as completed between September 2021 and February 2022. This indicates that SO successfully transitioned Garland Solar Storage from a construction-phase project to a fully operational asset within the expected timeframe, maintaining the original capacity specifications, which reflects a consistent and planned execution of their energy storage deployment strategy.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's (SO) battery energy storage capacity in 2023 compare to its continued involvement in the Garland Solar Storage facility in 2024, and what does this indicate about its long-term energy storage strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company (SO) reported that the Garland Solar Storage facility had an approximate nameplate capacity of 88 MW and was completed between September 2021 and February 2022, indicating active production of battery energy storage capacity. By 2024, SO still had a stake in the Garland Solar Storage facility, which remained at the same 88 MW capacity and under a 20-year PPA contract. This shows that SO maintained its energy storage footprint without expanding capacity at this site, suggesting a strategy of stable long-term commitment to existing storage infrastructure rather than rapid scaling.",

        "Hop 1: [SO](2023) \u2192 [Battery Energy Storage]: SO reported Garland Solar Storage with 88 MW capacity completed in early 2022 under a 20-year PPA.",
        "Hop 2: [Battery Energy Storage] \u2192 [Garland Solar Storage]: Garland Solar Storage is a specific instance of battery energy storage operated by SO.",
        "Hop 3: [Garland Solar Storage] \u2190 [SO](2024): SO retained its stake in Garland Solar Storage in 2024, with no change in capacity or PPA terms."

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company incurred a $96 million pre-tax charge due to the disallowance of certain capital investments at Nicor Gas, which directly impacted its gas distribution operations in Illinois, where Nicor Gas serves 2,276,000 customers. This financial burden likely constrained operational flexibility in the short term. By 2024, revenues associated with gas cost recovery in Illinois declined due to both lower natural gas prices and reduced demand from warmer weather, compounding the earlier financial strain. Although weather normalization mechanisms helped stabilize revenues, the cumulative effect of the prior year's capital disallowance and the 2024 cost recovery reductions suggests a dual pressure on operational performance in Illinois, where the company serves a significant customer base.",

The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See \"Cost of Natural Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\nRevenues from gas marketing services decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower commodity prices.\n\n## Customer Count\n\nThe number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations' and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.\n\nThe following table provides the number of customers served by Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

      "question": "How did NEE's capital allocation strategy toward wind projects evolve between 2022 and 2023, given its equity stake in NEP and the associated project development commitments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a noncontrolling interest in NEP, which owned or had stakes in a portfolio of wind, solar, and solar-plus-storage projects, with NEE accounting for its share of NEP's earnings under the equity method. By 2023, NEE disclosed capital expenditure plans totaling approximately 2,621 MW for new and repowered wind projects, indicating a strategic emphasis on expanding wind capacity. This shift suggests that NEE's involvement in wind projects intensified from indirect ownership through NEP in 2022 to direct capital commitments for wind development in 2023, reflecting a broader strategic pivot toward greater control and expansion of renewable assets.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

By 2023, this evolved into a concrete financial impact where Nicor Gas faced a pre-tax charge of approximately $96 million due to the disallowance of certain capital investments.

By 2024, the generation share from nuclear units increased to 25% for Alabama Power and 34% for Georgia Power, indicating a slight decrease for Alabama but a notable increase for Georgia. This shift likely increased Southern Company's exposure to nuclear-related financial risks, especially given the continued uncertainties around decommissioning funding, spent fuel disposal, and potential regulatory penalties. The answer synthesizes the generation percentages from both years and the consistent mention of financial risks tied to nuclear operations.",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

Achievement of these goals is dependent on various factors, many of which the Southern Company system does not control, including load growth across the Southern Company system's service territory, energy policy and regulations, natural gas prices, and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to economically transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet through a diverse portfolio of resources including low-carbon and carbon-free resources; making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing to implement effective energy efficiency and demand response programs; customer demand for carbon-free energy; implementing initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution emissions; continuing research and development with a focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Ohio owned KO Transmission, which operated a 90-mile interstate natural gas pipeline subject to FERC regulations. However, in February 2023, KO Transmission sold all of its pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC, for approximately book value. This divestiture effectively removed Duke Energy Ohio's direct ownership and operational responsibility in the interstate pipeline, thereby reducing its exposure to FERC's regulatory oversight related to natural gas transmission. By 2024, Duke Energy (as a consolidated entity) remained subject to FERC regulations, particularly through other regulated operations, but its direct compliance burden related to interstate gas transmission via KO Transmission ceased. This likely resulted in a reduction in compliance costs and risk exposure tied to FERC's pipeline-specific regulatory requirements.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 KO Transmission: Duke Energy Ohio wholly owned KO Transmission in 2023, which operated a 90-mile interstate pipeline transporting natural gas and was subject to FERC regulations.",
        "Hop 2: KO Transmission \u2192 FERC Regulations: KO Transmission was directly regulated by FERC due to its interstate pipeline operations, requiring compliance with FERC's rules and oversight.",
        "Hop 3: FERC Regulations \u2190 DUK(2024): By 2024, DUK was still subject to FERC regulations overall, but its exposure through KO Transmission ceased after the divestiture of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities in February 2023."

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE had a 31.9% ownership interest in a 303-mile natural gas pipeline under construction in West Virginia and Virginia, which faced regulatory and legal hurdles. By 2023, NEE's operational footprint in West Virginia expanded to include transmission infrastructure under construction in the PJM region, with an expected in-service date of 2028. This indicates a strategic shift from a minority stake in a challenged natural gas project to a more dominant role in regional electricity transmission infrastructure, suggesting a pivot toward long-term regulated asset development in the state.",

By 2023, NEP had issued an additional $500 million in December 2022, bringing the total principal amount of convertible notes to $1.6 billion. This indicates a growing exposure for NEE through its stake in NEP, as these notes could be converted into NEP common units or cash, depending on NEP's election.

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Progress financed storm recovery assets in North Carolina through DEPNCSF, which issued $770 million in bonds to acquire storm recovery property related to costs from 2018 and 2019. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress expanded its storm recovery financing to South Carolina by forming DEPSC SF, issuing $177 million in bonds to recover costs from 2014 through 2022. This marked a geographic and temporal expansion of the storm recovery financing model, with DEPSC SF being consolidated under Duke Energy Progress, just like DEPNCSF, maintaining the same non-recourse, special-purpose subsidiary structure.",

      "question": "How did SO's stake in the Tranquillity Solar Storage project evolve from its initial construction phase in 2022 to its completed status in 2024, and what does this indicate about their strategic focus on battery energy storage systems over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SO was in the early stages of constructing the Tranquillity Solar Storage project, which is a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) with a 72 MW nameplate capacity in Fresno County, CA, and was expected to be completed by Q1 2022. By 2024, the project had transitioned from the 'Under Construction' category to being listed under 'Projects Completed During 2022', with the COD finalized between November 2021 and March 2022. This indicates that SO maintained a strategic focus on BESS as a key component of their renewable energy portfolio, with the successful completion and continued ownership of the Tranquillity project reflecting a deliberate shift toward integrating storage with solar generation to enhance grid reliability and optimize energy delivery.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Battery Energy Storage System: SO was constructing the Tranquillity Solar Storage project, a BESS with 72 MW capacity, expected to be completed by Q1 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Battery Energy Storage System \u2192 Tranquillity Solar Storage: SO had a direct stake in this specific BESS project, indicating strategic investment in storage infrastructure.",
        "Hop 3: Tranquillity Solar Storage \u2190 SO(2024): By 2024, the project was listed as completed with a COD finalized between November 2021 and March 2022, showing continuity and successful execution of the earlier plan."

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's risk management activities were described as encompassing market risks including interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, with the Chief Risk Officer overseeing governance of commodity price risk. By 2024, foreign currency derivatives were explicitly categorized under 'Risk Management Activities' and were valued using Level 2 inputs such as forward foreign currency rate curves and counterparty credit quality.

Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.\n\nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\n\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, 'Risk Factors,' and 'Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information' for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy's exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the effects of regulation, commodity contract size and length, market liquidity, market conditions, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 17. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nFair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between m arket participants at the m easurem ent date. T he fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. F air value m easurem ents use m arket data or assum ptions m arket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assum ptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. T hese inputs m ay be readily observable, corroborated by m arket data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques m axim ize the use of observable inputs and m inim ize the use of unobservable inputs. A m idm arket pricing convention (the m idpoint price between bid and ask prices) is perm itted for use as a practical expedient.\n\nFair value m easurem ents are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy as defined by G AAP . C ertain investm ents are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. These investm ents are m easured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. T he net asset value is derived based on the investm ent cost, less any im pairm ent, plus or m inus changes resulting from  observable price changes for an identical or sim ilar investm ent of the sam e issuer.\n\nFair value accounting guidance perm its entities to elect to m easure certain financial instrum ents that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity m ethod investm ents or the C om pany's own debt, at fair value. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants have not elected to record any of these item s at fair value.\n\nValuation m ethods of the prim ary fair value m easurem ents disclosed below are as follows.\n\n## Investments in equity securities\n\nThe m ajority of investm ents in equity securities are valued using Level 1 m easurem ents. Investm ents in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. P rincipal active m arkets for equity prices include published exchanges such as the N YSE  and N asdaq Stock M arket. F oreign equity prices are translated from  their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active m arket. T here was no after-hours m arket activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value m easurem ents.\n\n## Investments in debt securities\n\nMost investm ents in debt securities are valued using Level 2 m easurem ents because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the term s of the debt instrum ent (m aturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the m arket for a particular fixed-incom e security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurem ent is Level 3.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nCommodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. C om m odity derivatives with observable forward curves are classified as Level 2. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term  of the contract and the unobservable period had m ore than an insignificant im pact on the valuation, the com m odity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustm ents for natural gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustm ents for electricity sales contracts. D uke E nergy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estim ate the fair value of certain com m odity contracts by a m arket participant price verification procedure. T his procedure provides a com parison of internal forward com m odity curves to m arket participant generated curves.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nMost over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial m odels that utilize observable inputs for sim ilar instrum ents and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional am ounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties.\n\n## Foreign currency derivatives\n\nMost over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives are valued using financial m odels that utilize observable inputs for sim ilar instrum ents and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward foreign currency rate curves, notional am ounts, foreign currency rates and credit quality of the counterparties.\n\n## Other fair value considerations\n\nSee Note 2 for further inform ation on the valuation of the C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups. See N ote 12 for a discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's acquisition of storm recovery property in 2023 relate to the expansion of state legislation governing storm cost financing in 2024, and what does this imply about the company's evolving regulatory risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress acquired storm recovery property through special purpose subsidiaries, issuing $237 million and $770 million in bonds respectively to finance unrecovered regulatory assets from storms in 2018 and 2019. By 2024, the company expanded this model to South Carolina, forming Duke Energy Progress SC Storm Funding, LLC and issuing an additional $177 million in bonds to cover storm costs from 2014 through 2022. This expansion was enabled by state legislation in both North and South Carolina that authorized the creation of storm recovery property and the imposition of non-bypassable charges on retail customers. The 2024 risk factors highlight that Duke Energy remains highly dependent on state legislation for cost recovery, and any changes in regulatory frameworks could limit its ability to recoup expenses, thereby increasing regulatory risk exposure. The temporal chain shows Duke Energy's growing reliance on state-backed storm recovery mechanisms and the associated regulatory dependencies.",

D E C N C SF  and D E P N C SF  were form ed in 2021 while DECSCSF was form ed in 2024, all for the sole purpose of issuing storm  recovery bonds to finance certain of D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm  costs incurred in N orth C arolina and South C arolina.\n\nI n 2021, D E C N C SF  and D E P N C SF  issued senior secured bonds, and used the proceeds to acquire storm  recovery property from  D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress. The storm  recovery property was created by state legislation and N C U C  financing orders for the purpose of financing storm  costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. In April 2024, D E P SC SF issued $177 m illion of senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire storm  recovery property from  D uke E nergy P rogress. T he storm  recovery property was created by state legislation and a P SC SC  financing order for the purpose of financing storm  costs incurred from  2014 through 2022.\n\nThe storm  recovery property acquired includes the right to im pose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from  all D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' N orth Carolina and South C arolina retail custom ers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. T he storm  recovery bonds are secured by the storm  recovery property and cash collections from  the storm  recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. T he bondholders have no recourse to D uke E nergy Carolinas or D uke E nergy P rogress. T hese entities are considered VIE s prim arily because their equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations. D uke E nergy C arolinas and Duke E nergy P rogress have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE s as described above and therefore D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress are considered the prim ary beneficiaries. D uke E nergy C arolinas consolidates D E C N C SF  and D uke E nergy P rogress consolidates D E P N C SF  and D E P SC SF .\n\nThe following table sum m arizes the im pact of these VIE s on D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\n## BUSINE SS STR ATE GY R ISK S\n\nDuke E nergy's future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy to reliably and affordably serve its customers while also balancing its grid and fleet modernization objectives and carbon emissions reduction goals.\n\nDuke E nergy's results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can im plem ent its business strategy and goals successfully. D uke E nergy is working to m eet growing and evolving custom er energy needs while balancing custom er reliability and affordability, and other priorities including the need to m odernize its fleet and the regulatory construct. D uke E nergy is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, econom ic and com petitive uncertainties and contingencies, m any of which are beyond its control and may m ake those goals difficult to achieve.\n\nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable D uke E nergy to reduce its carbon em issions. F or exam ple, D uke E nergy anticipates that its nuclear stations in N orth C arolina and South C arolina will continue to qualify for significant tax incentives in the form  of nuclear production tax credits under the IR A. N uclear energy is a reliable and clean energy source and nuclear tax incentives allowed under the IR A, including nuclear production tax credits, are expected to reduce the cost of the energy transition for our custom ers. If such nuclear production tax credits were elim inated or reduced, it could negatively im pact our ability to return the anticipated cost benefits to custom ers.\n\nAdditionally, new E P A rules issued in April 2024 im pose stringent G H G  em ission reduction standards, revised air toxic lim its, and wastewater discharge lim itations that m ay im pact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational tim eline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies m ay be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transm ission and distribution upgrades needed to accom m odate the build out of large volum es of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the C om pany to continue to retire existing carbon em itting assets or m ake investm ents in new generating capacity. T he C om pany m ay be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on tim e. In addition, new technologies that are not yet com m ercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, D uke E nergy's ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\n\nMeeting the evolving and growing energy needs of our custom ers will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, m ay challenge our ability to m eet custom er expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environm ent, particularly as dem and increases. O ur nuclear fleet is central to our ability to m eet these objectives and custom er expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond m idcentury. F ailure to receive approval from  the N R C  for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\n\nAs a consequence, D uke E nergy m ay not be able to fully im plem ent or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which m ay have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\n\n## REGULATORY, LE GISLATIVE  AND LE GAL R ISK S\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of N orth C arolina, South C arolina, F lorida, O hio, T ennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility com m issions, retail electric and natural gas rates m ay be subject to review and possible reduction by the com m issions, which m ay decrease the D uke E nergy R egistrants' earnings. Additionally, if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a tim ely basis, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be negatively im pacted. D ifferences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as N orth C arolina and South C arolina in D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' service territory, m ay also result in failure to recover costs.\n\nI f legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the D uke E nergy R egistrants' exclusive rights to serve their regulated custom ers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively im pacted. F ederal and state regulations, laws, com m ercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to prom ote and expand the use of E E measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in D uke E nergy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in D uke E nergy service territories or result in custom ers leaving the electric distribution system  and an increase in custom er net energy m etering, which allows custom ers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit am ount. O ver tim e, custom er adoption of these technologies could result in D uke E nergy not being able to fully recover the costs and investm ent in generation.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's limited $2 million NOL carryforward in South Carolina (as of 2022) influence its continued 50% investment in SNG's natural gas pipeline infrastructure in 2023, particularly given SNG's role in supplying gas to that same state?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's 2022 10-K shows only a $2 million net operating loss (NOL) carryforward remaining in South Carolina set to expire in 2036, indicating limited future tax benefits remaining in the state. Despite this constrained tax position, Southern Company maintained its 50% joint venture interest in SNG - a major natural gas pipeline supplying South Carolina from Gulf Coast basins - as confirmed in the 2023 10-K filing. This continued infrastructure investment suggests strategic prioritization of South Carolina's energy market despite limited remaining tax carryforwards, with SNG's pipeline network remaining critical for delivering natural gas supplies to the state's growing customer base.",

By 2023, this classification remained consistent, but Duke Energy expanded its disclosure to clarify that substantially all AFS debt investments qualify for regulatory accounting, with unrealized gains and losses deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. Additionally, in 2023, Duke Energy specifically noted that there were no material credit losses as of December 31, 2023, compared to the more general disclosure in 2022. This indicates a more detailed and refined reporting approach in 2023 while maintaining the same core accounting policy.",

When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its ex posure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:\n\n",

The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nGain on dispositions, net increased $105 million in 2021 compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net decreased $94 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes increased $102 million, or 59.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to $114 million in additional tax expense resulting from the sale of Sequent, including changes in state tax apportionment rates, and higher pre-tax earnings at the natural gas distribution utilities, partially offset by $18 million of tax benefit resulting from the PennEast Pipeline project impairment charges in the second and third quarters of 2021. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Other Business Activities\n\nSouthern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's 2022 acquisition of storm recovery property connect to its 2024 issuance of storm recovery bonds, and what does this evolution indicate about the company's long-term financing strategy for storm-related costs?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress transferred storm recovery property\u2014related to costs from storms in 2018 and 2019\u2014to their special-purpose subsidiaries (DECNCSF and DEPNCSF), which then issued $237 million and $770 million in storm recovery bonds, respectively. These bonds were secured by the storm recovery property, which granted the right to collect non-bypassable charges from retail customers. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress had repeated this financing mechanism by issuing $177 million in new storm recovery bonds tied to additional storms (Pax, Ulysses, Matthew, Florence, Michael, Dorian, Izzy, and Jasper), demonstrating a consistent and structured approach to financing storm-related costs through securitization. This shows a strategic evolution where the company leverages storm recovery property to issue secured bonds, enabling cost recovery through regulated customer charges over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Storm Recovery Property: Duke Energy Progress and Carolinas transferred storm-related regulatory assets (from 2018\u20132019 storms) to special-purpose entities, totaling $237M and $770M respectively.",
        "Hop 2: Storm Recovery Property \u2192 Storm Recovery Bonds: These assets were used to back and secure the issuance of storm recovery bonds, with collections from customer charges as the sole repayment source.",
        "Hop 3: Storm Recovery Bonds \u2190 DUK(2024): In 2024, Duke Energy Progress issued a new $177M round of storm recovery bonds tied to additional storms, indicating a recurring financing mechanism."

By 2024, the company had expanded its storm cost financing strategy into South Carolina through the formation of a new subsidiary, DEPSCSF, which issued $177 million in bonds to recover costs from 2014 through 2022. DECNC SF, as a VIE, continued to be consolidated by Duke Energy Carolinas due to its insufficient equity capitalization and its role in collecting non-bypassable charges from retail customers to service the bonds.

(DECNCSF) and Duke Energy Progress NC Storm Funding, LLC. (DEPNCSF) are bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\n\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $237 million and $770 million of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The storm recovery property was created by state legislation and NCUC financing orders for the purpose of financing storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. The storm recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from all Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The storm recovery bonds are secured by the storm recovery property and cash collections from the storm recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress. For additional information, see Notes 3 and 6.\n\nDECNCSF and DEPNCSF are considered VIEs primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIEs as described above and therefore Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DECNCSF and DEPNCSF, respectively.\n\nThe following table summarizes the impact of these VIEs on Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n",

By 2024, Duke Energy Florida received reimbursements from the NDTF for decommissioning costs, and realized gains and losses from sales of AFS securities were determined to be immaterial for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022.

This financial strain likely influenced the configuration of Nicor Gas' commercial paper program in 2024, which was specifically restricted to support its working capital needs, as noted in SO's 2024 10-K. The 2024 disclosures reveal that $700 million of a $2.45 billion credit arrangement expiring in 2029 was allocated to Nicor Gas under Southern Company Gas' commercial paper program, with the ability to adjust allocations between Nicor Gas and Southern Company Gas Capital. This suggests that the prior year's financial impact from Nicor Gas may have prompted a more structured and liquidity-conscious approach to short-term financing in 2024, particularly as $1.7 billion in variable rate demand revenue bonds also relied on allocated liquidity support.",

Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months.

      "question": "How did the reduction in Nicor Gas's commercial paper obligations from $392 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 impact Southern Company's consolidated short-term debt structure and weighted average interest rate?",
      "answer": "The reduction in Nicor Gas's commercial paper obligations from $392 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 contributed to a more favorable short-term debt structure for Southern Company, as evidenced by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on total notes payable from 5.7% in 2023 to 4.8% in 2024. This shift indicates that Southern Company benefited from refinancing efforts and lower reliance on higher-cost short-term debt through its Nicor Gas subsidiary, which helped lower overall borrowing costs.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's use of VIEs like DECNC SF evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of storm recovery financing and balance sheet impact?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy used VIEs like CRC to manage credit risk and account receivables, absorbing losses first through VIE equity and then through retained subordinated interests. By 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress had expanded their use of VIEs specifically for storm recovery financing, forming entities like DECNC SF, DEPNC SF, and DEPSC SF. These VIEs issued senior secured bonds\u2014DECNC SF and DEPNC SF in 2021, and DEPSC SF in 2024\u2014to finance unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs incurred between 2014 and 2022. The storm recovery bonds, totaling $177 million in 2024 alone, were secured by the right to collect non-bypassable charges from retail customers, with Duke consolidating these VIEs due to their insufficient equity capitalization and the company's control over their significant activities. This evolution reflects a strategic shift from general credit risk mitigation to targeted financing of storm-related regulatory assets, with a measurable impact on the consolidated balance sheets.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 VIE: Duke Energy used VIEs like CRC to manage credit risk from accounts receivable, absorbing losses through VIE equity and retained interests.",

        "Hop 3: DECNC SF \u2190 DUK(2024): Duke consolidated DECNC SF and similar VIEs due to their undercapitalization and Duke's control, with $177 million in new bond issuance in 2024 directly impacting the consolidated balance sheets."

The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Derivatives and Hedging,' for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\n\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment as a result of the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the company has resumed standard payment arrangement options . The Duke Energy Registrants are still monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties' abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants have observed a significant increase in utility account arrears as of December 31, 2021. There is an expectation of an increase in charge-offs in the future and the Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Revenue,\" respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Variable Interest Entities.'\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.\n\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate selfinsured retention. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Guarantees and Indemnifications,' for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy reported that substantially all investments in debt securities classified as AFS had unrealized gains and losses deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, with these amounts included in other comprehensive income until realized. By 2024, the continuation of AFS classification for debt investments\u2014evidenced by the repeated disclosure structure and the immaterial nature of realized gains and losses from AFS securities\u2014suggests consistent application of the AFS policy. However, the 2024 disclosures highlight ongoing decommissioning-related reimbursements from the NDTF, indicating that regulatory deferral mechanisms remained active but unchanged in structure. This demonstrates a stable temporal evolution of Duke Energy\u2019s AFS-debt investment relationship under regulatory accounting.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 AFS: Duke Energy applied AFS classification to debt investments, deferring unrealized gains/losses to regulatory accounts",

        "Hop 3: Debt Investments \u2190 DUK(2024): In 2024, Duke Energy continued classifying debt investments as AFS, with immaterial realized gains/losses and ongoing regulatory deferrals tied to NDTF reimbursements"

      "answer": "In 2023, SO incurred a $96 million pre-tax charge due to the disallowance of certain capital investments at Nicor Gas, signaling regulatory pushback that could have weakened Nicor Gas' financial position and increased credit risk exposure. This financial strain likely heightened concerns around customer collections and bad debt risk. However, Nicor Gas' exposure to bad debt was mitigated in 2024 by the Bad Debt Rider policy approved by the Illinois Commission, which allowed for the recovery (or refund) of the difference between actual bad debt experience and the benchmark expense used in base rates. This policy ensured that any increased bad debt costs beyond expectations were recoverable from customers, stabilizing Nicor Gas' financial exposure despite the earlier capital disallowance.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nuncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.\n\nCredit risk ex posure at Nicor G as is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 14 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk ex posure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest ex posure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit ex posure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, and interest rates. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets (included in \"Other\" or shown separately as \"Risk Management Activities\") and are measured at fair value. See Note 13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and Southern Company Gas' bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are ex cluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the \"normal\" scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.\n\nThe Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nThe purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's environmental compliance costs in 2022 influence commercial customer demand patterns in 2023, particularly in relation to the $92 million increase in distributed infrastructure revenue at PowerSecure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company noted that environmental compliance costs were being recovered through various rate mechanisms, and that increased costs could potentially reduce demand for electricity and natural gas from commercial and industrial customers. By 2023, the company reported a $92 million increase in distributed infrastructure projects at PowerSecure, which are typically adopted by commercial customers seeking more efficient or sustainable energy solutions. This suggests that rather than reducing overall energy demand, commercial customers may have shifted toward distributed energy infrastructure\u2014such as solar installations or microgrids\u2014as a response to higher energy costs driven by environmental compliance. This shift aligns with the earlier concern about demand sensitivity to regulatory costs, indicating a strategic adaptation by customers that contributed to growth in PowerSecure\u2019s revenue segment.",

        "Hop 1: [SO](2022) \u2192 Environmental Requirements: Southern Company recognized that environmental compliance costs were being recovered through rate mechanisms, but also acknowledged the risk that these increased costs could reduce demand for electricity and natural gas from commercial and industrial customers.",
        "Hop 2: Environmental Requirements \u2192 Commercial Customers: The 2023 filing explicitly states that many commercial and industrial customers may be affected by environmental regulations, which could influence their energy consumption patterns.",
        "Hop 3: Commercial Customers \u2190 [SO](2023): In 2023, Southern Company reported a $92 million increase in distributed infrastructure revenue at PowerSecure, primarily driven by commercial customer projects, indicating a shift in customer behavior that may be linked to environmental compliance pressures."

The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand, which could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated gas distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience underrecovered fuel and/or purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred.\n\n## The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants.\n\nThe consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.\n\nOutside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences, legislation, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy. For example, some cities in the United States have banned the use of natural gas in new construction.\n\nBoth federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy efficiency.\n\nCustomers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts.\n\nIn addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available methods and experience to incorporate the effects of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects.\n\nThe operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary Registrant.\n\nElectric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.\n\nVolatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, and the natural gas distribution and storage facilities of Southern Company Gas. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states which could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.\n\nIn the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency.

      "question": "How did SO's ownership structure and capacity allocation for the Reading wind project change from its initial construction in 2020 (as reported in the 2022 filing) to 2024, and what does this reveal about Southern Power's evolving control and partnership strategy in wind energy?",
      "answer": "In 2020, the Reading wind project was completed with a nameplate capacity of 200 MW and was reported as part of Southern Power's noncontrolling equity partnerships (2022 filing). By 2024, SO (through Southern Power) had become the controlling partner in the tax equity partnerships owning Reading, consolidating it as a controlled subsidiary. This shift indicates a strategic move by Southern Power to increase direct control over key wind assets, even while operating within tax equity partnership frameworks. The nameplate capacity remained at 200 MW, but the ownership structure evolved from a noncontrolling interest to a controlling position.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Wind: In 2022, SO reported wind facilities with up to 30 years of useful life and listed Reading as a completed wind project with 200 MW capacity.",

The increases were primarily associated with growth across the NEER businesses and higher depletion related to natural gas and oil production.\n\n## Gains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets -net\n\nIn 2024, the change in gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net primarily reflect the September 2024 sales of ownership interests in connection with the pipeline joint v enture and the renewable assets joint venture. See Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/A ssets.\n\n## Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity M ethod Investees\n\nNEER recognized $267 million and $649 million of equity in losses of equity method investees in 2024 and 2023, respectively .

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2022 financial commitments to MEAG Power's Plant Vogtle ownership interest influence its 2023 electricity supply strategy in light of the 7.1% weather-adjusted growth in commercial KWH sales?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (through Georgia Power) had a $42 million capacity purchase commitment tied to MEAG Power's interest in Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, with ongoing construction of Units 3 and 4 under joint ownership agreements. MEAG Power, which supplied electricity to 48 municipally-owned systems in Georgia (as of 2023), sourced power from both self-owned generation (some jointly-owned with Georgia Power) and external purchases. In 2023, Southern Company experienced a 7.1% weather-adjusted increase in commercial KWH sales, which likely increased demand pressure on existing supply arrangements. Given the long-term nature of the MEAG Power commitments and the joint ownership of Plant Vogtle infrastructure, this growing commercial demand may have necessitated strategic coordination with MEAG Power to ensure adequate electricity supply, particularly as MEAG Power itself relied on a mix of owned generation and purchases (including from Georgia Power) to meet customer needs.",

See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner holding the same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 76,289 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Nicor Gas obtained financing separately without credit support from affiliates and maintained its own commercial paper program to support working capital needs, with restrictions on loans to affiliates up to $1.7 billion in retained earnings. Southern Company Gas Capital provided commercial paper support to other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries but not to Nicor Gas. By 2024, Nicor Gas became a borrower under a $700 million credit arrangement expiring in 2029, which was part of a larger $1.5 billion arrangement shared with Southern Company Gas Capital, allowing flexible sublimits and adjustments between the two entities. Additionally, Nicor Gas had a separate $100 million credit facility expiring in 2025. This evolution reflects a more integrated financing structure where Southern Company Gas Capital continued to support broader gas operations, while Nicor Gas maintained a distinct but now more formally structured borrowing relationship within the Southern Company system.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "In 2023, NEE subsidiaries held $3,913 million in noncontrolling interests in limited partnerships, which were classified as VIEs and not consolidated due to lack of controlling financial interest. These limited partnerships were part of NEE\u2019s broader corporate investment strategy. By 2024, limited partnerships were explicitly included as part of the pension plan\u2019s alternative investment allocation, which had a target of 20%. This indicates that while NEE had significant exposure to limited partnerships through its subsidiaries in 2023, the following year saw a formal integration of such structures into the pension fund\u2019s investment strategy, suggesting a deliberate use of limited partnerships across different financial vehicles within the company.",

Despite this reduction, Mississippi Power continued to operate under existing agreements, including interconnection and transmission service arrangements with regional partners like Cooperative Energy through 2031. The modest decline in investment does not indicate a disengagement from Mississippi operations, as the state remains a core part of SNG\u2019s pipeline network and Southern Company\u2019s gas infrastructure strategy.

The agreement includes combined operations (including joint commitment and dispatch) and real-time energy sales and purchases and is expected to create energy cost savings and enhanced system reliability for both parties. Projected revenues are expected to offset any increased administrative costs incurred by Alabama Power. Under the agreement, Alabama Power has the right to participate in a portion of PowerSouth's future incremental load growth.\n\nAlabama Power also has a separate agreement with PowerSouth involving interconnection between their systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from PowerSouth to certain distributing cooperatives in the service territory of Alabama Power is governed by the Southern Company/PowerSouth Network Transmission Service Agreement.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2023 fuel procurement cost reductions relate to the regulatory requirements for FERC approval, and how does this contrast with the regulatory risk exposure from their 50% stake in SNG's $3 billion pipeline project in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company reduced fuel expenses by $230 million (30.8%) and purchased power expenses by $21 million (49.9%), partly due to lower natural gas prices and reduced volume purchased, with these procurement activities conducted under FERC-approved agreements. This indicates strong regulatory alignment and cost optimization under existing FERC oversight. In 2024, Southern Company Gas\u2019 50% stake in SNG\u2019s $3 billion pipeline project remains subject to FERC approval, introducing regulatory risk and uncertainty around cost recovery and project completion timing. Unlike the 2023 procurement activities, which were already operating under finalized FERC approvals, the SNG pipeline represents a forward-looking infrastructure investment with significant capital exposure and conditional regulatory risk. Thus, while 2023 demonstrated successful execution under existing FERC frameworks, 2024 highlights the company\u2019s exposure to regulatory outcomes on new, large-scale projects.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 FERC Approval: Fuel and purchased power activities were conducted under FERC-approved agreements, with a 30.8% decrease in fuel costs and 49.9% decrease in purchased power costs.",
        "Hop 2: FERC Approval \u2192 SNG: SNG\u2019s $3 billion pipeline project is subject to FERC approval, indicating that regulatory decisions will determine the project's future viability and capital recovery.",

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's 2023 acquisition of storm recovery property influence the $177 million storm recovery bond issuance in 2024, particularly in terms of enabling the non-bypassable charges as a dedicated revenue source under the regulatory framework established by state legislation and NCUC orders?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Progress acquired storm recovery property created under North Carolina legislation and NCUC orders, which granted the right to impose non-bypassable charges on retail customers to recover storm-related costs. This acquisition directly enabled the 2024 issuance of $177 million in storm recovery bonds, as the bonds were secured by the storm recovery property and the associated non-bypassable charges. These charges, effective May 1, 2024, provided a dedicated revenue stream to satisfy the debt obligation, demonstrating a clear temporal and causal link between the acquisition and the bond issuance within the regulated framework.",

The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed.

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company used present value techniques with credit-adjusted risk-free rates to estimate asset retirement obligations (AROs), relying on projections of future removal costs for facilities like ash ponds and nuclear plants. By 2024, the company disclosed valuation methods for pension plan assets that emphasized the role of judgment in interpreting market data, noting that different assumptions or methodologies could materially affect fair value estimates.

By 2023, Southern Company deepened its involvement in natural gas infrastructure by maintaining a 50% investment in SNG, a major pipeline operator that connects supply basins in the Gulf Coast to markets including Tennessee. SNG's 7,000-mile pipeline network played a key role in supplying natural gas to Southern Company Gas' customers, indicating a strategic alignment to enhance supply diversification and infrastructure resilience.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO reported that the Tranquillity Solar Storage project, a battery energy storage system with a nameplate capacity of 72 MW, had an expected commercial operation date (COD) of November 2021 and first quarter 2022. By 2023, SO confirmed that the project was completed within that timeline, with COD occurring from November 2021 through March 2022. This indicates that SO successfully advanced the project from construction to completion within the anticipated timeframe, reflecting effective execution in deploying battery energy storage systems. The consistent reporting of the 72 MW capacity across both years further demonstrates stability in the project's design and output expectations.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Battery Energy Storage System: SO reported in 2022 that Tranquillity Solar Storage was a battery energy storage system with 72 MW capacity under construction, expected to reach COD in November 2021 and Q1 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Battery Energy Storage System \u2192 Tranquillity Solar Storage: The Tranquillity Solar Storage project is classified as a battery energy storage system, indicating SO\u2019s strategic focus on deploying this type of infrastructure.",
        "Hop 3: Tranquillity Solar Storage \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, SO confirmed that the Tranquillity Solar Storage project had reached COD between November 2021 and March 2022, aligning with the earlier timeline and maintaining the 72 MW capacity."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's environmental compliance costs in 2023, driven by regulatory requirements affecting industrial customers, influence the structure and duration of power purchase agreements with those same industrial customers in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company identified significant potential costs related to environmental compliance, including closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, and operational changes, which could be passed on to customers through regulated rates. These increased costs were noted to potentially reduce demand for electricity and natural gas from industrial customers, who are directly impacted by such regulatory requirements. By 2024, Southern Power's long-term PPAs with industrial customers showed a high investment coverage ratio (96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034), with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. This suggests that Southern Company may have structured longer-term agreements to mitigate the financial risks associated with environmental compliance costs and stabilize revenue streams in the face of potential demand volatility from industrial customers. The evolution from regulatory cost exposure in 2023 to structured long-term PPAs in 2024 reflects a strategic response to maintain financial stability while serving industrial customers under evolving environmental regulations.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Environmental Requirements: Southern Company faced potential material increases in environmental compliance costs due to closure, monitoring, and operational changes.",

In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 46% were with BBB+ to BBBor equivalent rated counterparties, and 6% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fix ed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 78,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. G as distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. SNG is developing a proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, which the operator of the joint venture anticipates will be completed by 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Construction Programs\" in Item 7 herein for additional information.",

By 2024, foreign currency derivatives were explicitly categorized under 'Risk Management Activities' and their fair value was reflected as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet.

      "answer": "In 2022, PowerSecure experienced a $119 million goodwill impairment due to declining macroeconomic conditions and reduced cash flow projections, signaling financial stress in its operations. Despite this impairment, PowerSecure continued to be a key provider of distributed energy and resilience solutions for Southern Company in 2024, as explicitly stated in the 'Other Business Activities' section of the 2024 10-K. However, by 2024, PowerSecure was grouped within the 'All Other' segment, which includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Development Projects\n\nIn November 2024, Southern Power committed to a development project to repower 200 MWs of the 299-MW Kay Wind facility located in Kay County, Oklahoma. The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

      "question": "How did NEE's valuation approach for congestion-related forward contracts evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly regarding the use of discounted cash flow models and the range of forward prices applied?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NEE valued forward contracts - congestion using discounted cash flow models with a forward price range of $(30) to $32 per MWh. By 2024, the company continued using discounted cash flow models for these contracts, but the forward price range had shifted to $(49) to $22 per MWh. This indicates a widening of the negative price range and a narrowing of the positive price range, suggesting increased volatility and potential risk in congestion pricing that NEE factored into its valuation methodology. While the core valuation technique remained consistent, the change in forward price ranges reflects an evolution in NEE's assumptions about congestion pricing dynamics between 2023 and 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NEE](2023) \u2192 [Discounted Cash Flow]: NEE used discounted cash flow models to value forward contracts - congestion with a forward price range of $(30) to $32 per MWh in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: [Discounted Cash Flow] \u2192 [Forward Contracts - Congestion]: Discounted cash flow is the valuation technique applied to forward contracts - congestion, incorporating forward price assumptions.",
        "Hop 3: [Forward Contracts - Congestion] \u2190 [NEE](2024): In 2024, NEE continued using discounted cash flow models for congestion-related forward contracts but adjusted the forward price range to $(49) to $22 per MWh."

      "question": "How did the accelerated amortization requirements and multi-year rate case provisions in Illinois' 2022 Clean Energy Law impact NEE's 2024 stock performance, particularly in relation to their GridLiance operations in Illinois?",
      "answer": "The Clean Energy Law enacted in Illinois in September 2021 mandated that ComEd file a general rate case or a new four-year multi-year plan by January 20, 2023, and required the accelerated amortization of ComEd's unprotected excess deferred income taxes. These provisions increased regulatory scrutiny and financial pressure on NEE's Illinois operations, particularly through GridLiance, which had significant assets in Illinois. By 2024, these regulatory challenges directly affected investor confidence and contributed to a stock decline, as noted in NEE\u2019s 2024 10-K filing. The combination of increased compliance costs, earnings pressure from accelerated amortization, and uncertainty around future rate structures undermined market sentiment toward NEE\u2019s long-term profitability in the state.",

        "Hop 2: GridLiance \u2192 Regulatory Challenges: The 2022 Clean Energy Law in Illinois imposed a requirement for ComEd to file a new rate case or multi-year plan by January 20, 2023, and mandated accelerated amortization of excess deferred income taxes, increasing financial and regulatory pressure.",
        "Hop 3: Regulatory Challenges \u2190 NEE(2024): NEE\u2019s 2024 10-K filing cited regulatory challenges as a key factor behind a stock performance decline, indicating that investor confidence was negatively impacted by ongoing regulatory pressures, including those stemming from Illinois\u2019 Clean Energy Law."

On September 15, 2021, the Illinois Public Act 102-0662 was signed into law by the Governor of Illinois ('Clean Energy Law'). The Clean Energy Law includes, among other features, (1) procurement of CMCs from qualifying nuclear-powered generating facilities, (2) a requirement to file a general rate case or a new four-year multi-year plan no later than January 20, 2023 to establish rates effective after ComEd's existing performance-based distribution formula rate sunsets, (3)  an  extension  of  and  certain  adjustments  to  ComEd's  energy  efficiency  MWh  savings  goals,  (4)  revisions  to  the  Illinois  RPS requirements,  including  expanded  charges  for  the  procurement  of  RECs  from  wind  and  solar  generation,  (5)  a  requirement  to accelerate amortization of ComEd's unprotected excess deferred income taxes that ComEd was previously directed by the ICC to amortize using the average rate assumption method which equates to approximately 39.5 years, and (6) requirements that the ICC initiate  and  conduct  various  regulatory  proceedings  on  subjects  including  ethics,  spending,  grid  investments,  and  performance metrics. Regulatory or legal challenges regarding the validity or implementation of the Clean Energy Law are possible and Exelon and ComEd cannot reasonably predict the outcome of any such challenges.\n\n## Carbon Mitigation Credit\n\nThe  Clean  Energy  Law  establishes  decarbonization  requirements  for  Illinois  as  well  as  programs  to  support  the  retention  and development of emissions-free sources of electricity.

Subsequent to December 31, 2021, Southern Power amended its $60 million letter of credit facility, which, among other things, extended the expiration date from 2023 to 2025 and increased the amount to $75 million. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(b) Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $800 million of the arrangement expiring in 2026 and all $250 million of the arrangement expiring in 2022. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2026 also includes $700 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2026, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted. See \"Structural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration or, in the case of Southern Power, cross-default provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Such crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Southern Power defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated.

      "answer": "Southern Company's 2022 investment in distributed energy solutions was part of its broader strategy to expand into emerging energy technologies and services. PowerSecure, a subsidiary acquired in 2016 and responsible for developing distributed energy and resilience solutions, experienced declining macroeconomic conditions in 2022 that reduced sales growth and cash flow projections. This led to a $119 million goodwill impairment recorded in Q4 2022. By 2023, despite the impairment, Southern Company still held a stake in PowerSecure, indicating continued strategic interest in distributed energy despite short-term financial setbacks. The impairment suggests that the 2022 investment expectations for distributed energy were not met, affecting the valuation of PowerSecure and signaling a need for strategic recalibration.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n## Business Activities\n\nSouthern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n- The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.\n- Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.\n- Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments - gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets - and one nonreportable segment, all other. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments also included wholesale gas services. See Notes 7, 15, and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nSouthern Company's other business activities include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications and gas storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.\n\nSee FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for a discussion of the many factors that could impact the Registrants' future results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n## Southern Company\n\nOn October 29, 2021, Southern Company completed the sale of assets subject to a domestic leveraged lease to the lessee for $45 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. On December 13, 2021, Southern Company completed the termination of its leasehold interest in assets associated with its two international leveraged lease projects and received cash proceeds of approximately $673 million after the accelerated exercise of the lessee's purchase options. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $93 million ($99 million gain after tax). See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company\" for additional information.\n\n## Alabama Power\n\nOn September 23, 2021, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Calhoun Power Company, LLC, which owns and operates a 743-MW winter peak, simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun County, Alabama (Calhoun Generating Station). The completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction and waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC. On October 28, 2021, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC to procure additional generating capacity through this acquisition. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.",

This same compliance approach was maintained in 2024, with Mississippi Power Company continuing to meet those conditions and using the same reduced disclosure format.

This indicates a more integrated role for NextEra Energy Marketing, LLC in 2024, where its risk management activities were more closely tied to the delivery of full energy and capacity solutions, suggesting a strategic shift in how NEER leveraged its subsidiary to support customer supply while optimizing its power generation and natural gas and oil production assets.",

      "answer": "In 2023, SO reported that the Garland Solar Storage facility, completed between September 2021 and February 2022, had an 88 MW nameplate capacity and was part of a 20-year PPA contract. By 2024, SO's filings reaffirmed the facility's role in their portfolio, showing no changes to its capacity or contract duration. However, SO shifted focus toward new solar projects like Millers Branch in Texas, indicating a broader diversification strategy while maintaining its existing battery energy storage commitments.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Battery Energy Storage: SO reported Garland Solar Storage with 88 MW capacity completed under a 20-year PPA.",

        "Hop 3: Garland Solar Storage \u2190 SO(2024): SO reaffirmed the facility's status and capacity, while emphasizing new solar developments."

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan targeted a 10% allocation to convertible securities and 13% to alternative investments, with pooled separate accounts being one of the commingled investment vehicles used to achieve diversification and risk mitigation. By 2024, the pension plan increased its allocation to alternative investments to 20% while reducing convertible securities to 5%. This reallocation reflects a strategic shift toward higher-risk, higher-return alternative investments, which are also accessed through pooled separate accounts and other commingled structures. The continued use of pooled separate accounts across both years shows NEE's ongoing reliance on these vehicles to implement its evolving asset allocation strategy.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan allocated 10% of its assets to convertible securities, reflecting a strategy that included a moderate emphasis on these instruments for their potential to provide both income and capital appreciation with some downside protection. By 2024, this allocation had decreased to 5%, signaling a reduced emphasis on convertible securities. This shift aligns with a broader strategic move toward a higher allocation in alternative investments (from 13% in 2022 to 20% in 2024), suggesting that NEE's pension plan is recalibrating its risk-return profile by favoring alternative investments over convertible securities. This evolution indicates a strategic repositioning to enhance diversification and potentially improve long-term returns while managing risk.",

The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets located at the refinery and owned by Mississippi Power, with a lease receivable balance of $139 million at December 31, 2024, that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies. See Note 9 under \"Lessor\" for additional information.\n\nSee Note 8 under \"Long-term Debt\" for information regarding debt secured by certain assets of Georgia Power and Southern Company Gas.\n\n## 6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted riskfree rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory assets.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally surface impoundments. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle). See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein for additional information. Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.\n\nSouthern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy Carolinas' use of Storm Recovery Bonds evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to the DECNC SF subsidiary's role in financing storm-related regulatory assets across different geographic regions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas used the Storm Recovery Bonds issued by DECNC SF to finance unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs incurred in North Carolina during 2018 and 2019, with $237 million issued for this purpose. By 2024, the scope expanded geographically, as Duke Energy Progress issued additional bonds through a new subsidiary, DEPSC SF, to finance storm costs incurred from 2014 through 2022 across both North and South Carolina. This evolution shows a strategic extension of the Storm Recovery Bond mechanism to cover a broader timeline and geographic footprint, while maintaining DECNC SF's consolidation under Duke Energy Carolinas and using similar non-bypassable customer charges as the repayment source.",

However, in 2024, Mississippi Power Company not only continued to meet these conditions but also explicitly stated that it would not furnish an annual report to its parent company, The Southern Company, indicating a shift toward a more independent regulatory reporting posture.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Ohio had full ownership and operational control of KO Transmission, an interstate pipeline company subject to FERC regulations, which included cybersecurity compliance obligations. In February 2023, KO Transmission sold all of its pipeline facilities to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC for approximately book value, effectively reducing Duke Energy Ohio's direct operational exposure to those regulated assets. However, in 2023, Duke Energy as a whole remained subject to FERC-enforced cybersecurity standards related to critical infrastructure, particularly through its other regulated entities. Thus, while Duke Energy Ohio's direct asset-based exposure to FERC cybersecurity compliance via KO Transmission decreased after the divestiture, the company still maintained exposure through broader regulatory requirements across its system.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's notes payable structure with Nicor Gas evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about their liquidity strategy and capital allocation priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Nicor Gas had $530 million in commercial paper and $300 million in short-term bank debt, with weighted average interest rates of 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively. By 2024, Nicor Gas had reduced its commercial paper to $172 million and eliminated its short-term bank debt entirely, while the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper increased to 4.6%. This shift indicates a more conservative liquidity strategy, with a reduced reliance on short-term borrowings and a possible reallocation of capital toward longer-term financing or operational investments. The 2024 credit arrangement shows that Nicor Gas is a borrower under a $700 million facility restricted for working capital needs, suggesting a strategic focus on maintaining operational flexibility while managing interest rate exposure.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

By 2023, this relationship deepened through a coordinated planning and operations agreement initiated in 2021, which included joint commitment and dispatch, real-time energy sales and purchases, and an agreement for Alabama Power to provide approximately 100 MWs of year-round capacity service to PowerSouth starting in early 2024. Additionally, in 2023, Alabama Power maintained operational control of facilities jointly owned with PowerSouth, indicating a strategic shift toward greater integration and shared resource management.",

In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 46% were with BBB+ to BBBor equivalent rated counterparties, and 6% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fix ed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 78,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. G as distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. SNG is developing a proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, which the operator of the joint venture anticipates will be completed by 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

      "answer": "In 2022, nuclear units contributed 26% and 28% of total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. By 2024, this reliance had increased to 25% and 34%, indicating a shift toward greater dependence on nuclear energy. Since nuclear facilities are subject to inherent risks including cyber intrusions, this increased reliance likely heightened Southern Company's exposure to potential cyber incidents. The 2024 filing explicitly notes continued financial risks from cyber intrusions tied to nuclear operations, including potential compliance costs and expenditures related to mandatory cybersecurity standards. Therefore, the increased nuclear generation share from 2022 to 2024 correlates with a potentially higher financial burden related to cyber risk mitigation, compliance, and operational continuity planning.",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's reliance on SCS for operational services in 2022 influence SNG's natural gas transportation agreements and ultimately affect Southern Company Gas' equity earnings from SNG in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's operating subsidiaries relied heavily on SCS for a wide range of services, including operations, engineering, and procurement, with costs running into hundreds of millions of dollars. SCS acted as an agent for these subsidiaries in managing long-term interstate natural gas transportation agreements with SNG, which were subject to FERC regulation. These agreements incurred transportation costs that continued through 2024. Southern Company Gas, as an equity investor in SNG, earned $146 million in 2024, the same amount as in 2022, suggesting that despite ongoing reliance and contractual activity through SCS, the financial return from SNG remained flat over the period.",

We also have audited Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, Southern Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nSouthern Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's stake in SEGCO in 2022 and its relationship to electric generating units evolve into the reported changes in electric generating unit values by 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (SO) held a $30 million stake in SEGCO, which owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs. SEGCO's generating units were expected to retire by 2028, but Alabama Power and Georgia Power (both subsidiaries of SO) were evaluating extending operations beyond that date. By 2023, SEGCO continued to produce power through these units, with Alabama Power and Georgia Power equally sharing capacity and making payments to cover SEGCO's operating expenses, taxes, interest, and a return on equity. However, the overall value of electric generating units reported by Southern Company decreased from $760 million in 2022 to $670 million in 2023, indicating a shift in asset valuation or investment strategy. This change reflects a reduction in reported value of $90 million, suggesting potential asset retirements or revaluations across the company's portfolio, including those tied to SEGCO.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 SEGCO: Southern Company had a $30 million stake in SEGCO in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: SEGCO \u2192 Electric Generating Units: SEGCO owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs.",
        "Hop 3: Electric Generating Units \u2190 SO(2023): Southern Company reported a decrease in the value of electric generating units from $760 million in 2022 to $670 million in 2023."

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's approach to preferred equity financing evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly with regard to the redemption of its Series A Preferred Stock and its associated Depositary Shares?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy disclosed its existing capital structure, which included Series A Preferred Stock and its corresponding Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of that preferred stock. By January 31, 2024, the company announced a definitive plan to redeem all 20,000 outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and all 20,000,000 associated Depositary Shares on March 15, 2024, at a redemption price of $25,000 per preferred share ($25.00 per Depositary Share). This indicates a strategic shift in Duke Energy\u2019s capital structure management, moving away from this particular preferred equity instrument. In the 2024 filings, while the Certificate of Designations for Series A Preferred Stock was still referenced, there was no new issuance or structural change announced, suggesting the redemption marked a discontinuation of this specific financing vehicle.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's reliance on cost recovery mechanisms in 2023 shift in relation to environmental remediation liabilities by 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's regulatory and environmental risk exposure over time?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy's operating results were exposed to volatility due to weather events and fuel cost fluctuations, with cost recovery mechanisms being a key accounting policy to manage these risks, particularly for fuel costs subject to state utility commission approval. By 2024, the company faced environmental remediation liabilities at multiple sites, with costs expected to be significant and ongoing, and only partially recoverable through regulatory mechanisms. The inclusion of environmental remediation within cost recovery mechanisms, as noted in a peer utility's 2024 filing, indicates that such costs are increasingly being factored into regulated rate structures. This suggests that Duke Energy's exposure to environmental liabilities is growing and being partially mitigated through regulatory cost recovery, but uncertainty remains around full reimbursement, especially for legacy and joint liability sites.",

Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC.\n\nIn addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms.\n\n## Integrated Resource Planning\n\nEach of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix  of resources to meet the ex isting and future demand requirements of its customers. In addition, each year the Southern Company system engages in a scenario planning process, developing scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In 2024, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO prices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of CO  emitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 7 herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies, as well as a discussion of the Southern Company system's continued generating fleet transition. 2 2\n\n## Alabama Power\n\nTriennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet ex pected customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs any new generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business. Alabama Power provided its most recent IRP to the Alabama PSC during 2022. On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nTriennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. In 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the G eorgia PSC, and certain intervenors. On January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP with the G eorgia PSC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" and \" - Rate Plans\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.",

The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur, including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.\n\nAs part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value.\n\nGoodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021.

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE maintained a noncontrolling interest in NEP, which already owned a portfolio of solar plus battery storage projects through its limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. This structure positioned NEP as a key vehicle for NEE to access contracted clean energy assets with stable long-term cash flows. By 2024, NEE's capital allocation strategy had evolved significantly, with $4,265 MW of planned battery storage investments indicating a clear prioritization of energy storage as a core component of its clean energy portfolio.

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's nuclear units represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. These nuclear facilities were already subject to significant safety risks, including potential regulatory fines and shutdowns by the NRC, as well as high capital expenditures for security and compliance. By 2023, the share of KWHs generated by nuclear units increased to 27% and 29% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, with the addition of Plant Vogtle Unit 4 under construction. This expansion increased the company\u2019s exposure to safety risks, particularly in light of the NRC\u2019s authority to impose new safety requirements, which could lead to higher compliance costs. The company also faced ongoing risks related to cyber intrusions and physical attacks, which could further elevate licensing and compliance expenses.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, SEGCO's generating units at Plant Gaston were expected to retire by December 31, 2028, with Southern Company evaluating the potential extension of operations beyond that date. Alabama Power and Georgia Power, through SEGCO, made payments for operating expenses, taxes, interest, and a return on equity, with $112 million in 2023. By 2024, the retirement date for Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 was still under consideration, but Georgia Power formally requested in the 2025 IRP to extend operations through at least December 31, 2034. Additionally, the payments increased to $115 million in 2024, indicating a continuation and slight increase in financial commitments through SEGCO. This reflects a strategic shift toward extending the operational life of Plant Gaston, supported by increased financial obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 SEGCO: Southern Company, through its subsidiaries Alabama Power and Georgia Power, equally owns SEGCO, which operates Plant Gaston with a 2028 retirement date and $112 million in operational payments in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: SEGCO \u2192 Plant Gaston: SEGCO owns and operates the generating units at Plant Gaston, with Alabama and Georgia Power making proportional payments for operating expenses and returns.",
        "Hop 3: Plant Gaston \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Georgia Power proposed extending Plant Gaston's operations to at least 2034 in the 2025 IRP, with operational payments increasing to $115 million, signaling a strategic commitment to prolong coal-fired generation."

Effective May 1, 2024, as approved under the Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is $8 million for Plant V ogtle Unit 4. See Note 2 under \"G eorgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters\" for additional information.\n\n## 7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a V IE. If a venture is a V IE for which a Registrant is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.\n\nFor entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $128 million and $126 million, respectively, primarily related to investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings/losses from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Retirement of SEGCO's generating units is currently expected to occur by December 31, 2028. However, Alabama Power, in conjunction with Georgia Power, is evaluating extending the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the indicated retirement date. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2025 IRP\" for additional information. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and an ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $115 million in 2024, $112 million in 2023, and $124 million in 2022 for Alabama Power and $118 million in 2024, $115 million in 2023, and $127 million in 2022 for G eorgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $20 million in 2024, $25 million in 2023, and $14 million in 2022, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the V IEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb ex pected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nSP Solar is owned by Southern Power and a limited partner. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest, and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns a 66% ownership interest. The",

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "question": "How did the change in fair value of NEE's forward contracts - gas from 2022 to 2024 reflect the company's evolving use of discounted cash flow valuation techniques for these instruments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE reported the fair value of forward contracts - gas at $191 million in assets and $31 million in liabilities, using discounted cash flow valuation. By 2024, these figures had increased to $296 million in assets and $46 million in liabilities for the same category, still using discounted cash flow. The weighted-average forward price per MMBtu also rose from $3 in 2022 to $4 in 2024, indicating a sustained but evolving application of the valuation technique. This suggests NEE maintained its discounted cash flow approach while experiencing increased exposure or volatility in gas forward contracts over the two-year period.",

        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Discounted Cash Flow: NEE used discounted cash flow valuation for forward contracts - gas with $191M in assets and $31M in liabilities in 2022",
        "Hop 2: Discounted Cash Flow \u2192 Forward Contracts - Gas: Discounted cash flow was consistently used as the valuation technique for gas forward contracts across years",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy was subject to HB 951, which mandated the NCUC to develop a carbon plan targeting a 70% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions from its generation in North Carolina on the least-cost path to carbon neutrality by 2050. By 2024, Duke had filed its 2023 System Wide Carolinas Resource Plan (Portfolio 3) and later reached a settlement with stakeholders confirming this portfolio as the reference for planning. This included procurement of solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and natural gas assets, as well as exploratory work on advanced nuclear and offshore wind. The evolution from 2023 to 2024 reflects a strategic shift from regulatory compliance planning to active implementation of a diversified generation mix to meet the HB 951-mandated emissions targets while addressing increased load forecasts and ensuring reliability and affordability.",

          "chunk_text": "The Duke E nergy R egistrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of C O  em issions over tim e. Between 2005 and 2024, the D uke E nergy R egistrants have collectively lowered the C O  em issions from  their electricity generation by 44%. T im elines and initiatives, as well as im plem entation of new technologies, for future G H G  em ission reductions will vary in each state in which the C om pany operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, custom ers and other stakeholders. D uke E nergy's goals and actions taken to reduce CO emissions potentially lower the exposure to any future m andatory C O  em ission reduction requirem ents, whether as a result of federal legislation, E P A regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown em ission reduction requirem ents. 2 2 2 2\n\nActions to reduce C O  em issions have included the retirem ent of 58 coal-fired electric generating units with a com bined generating capacity of over 8,000 M W , while investing in renewables and energy storage and state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer C O  em issions per unit of electricity generated than coal. Duke E nergy also has m ade investm ents to increase E E  offerings and ensure continued operations of its zero-C O  em issions hydropower and nuclear plants. T hese efforts have diversified our electric generating system  and significantly reduced C O  em issions. 2 2 2 2\n\nDuke E nergy will continue to explore the use of currently available and com m ercially dem onstrated technology, as well as developing technologies, to m eet custom er dem and reliably and affordably while reducing C O  em issions to achieve its net-zero goal as well as to com ply with any future regulations. T hese technologies include E E , wind, solar and storage, as well as evolving technologies like carbon capture, utilization and storage, the use of hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels, long-duration energy storage and advanced nuclear. D uke Energy plans to adjust to and incorporate these evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability of energy while m eeting regulatory requirem ents and custom er dem ands. U nder any future scenario involving m andatory C O  lim itations, the D uke E nergy R egistrants would plan to seek recovery of their com pliance costs through appropriate regulatory m echanism s. Future levels of C O  em issions by the D uke E nergy R egistrants will be influenced by variables that include custom er growth and capacity needs in the jurisdictions in which they operate, public policy, tax incentives, econom ic conditions that affect electricity dem and, weather conditions, fuel prices, m arket prices, availability of resources and labor, com pliance with new or existing regulations, the ability to m ake enhancem ents to transm ission and distribution system s to support increased deploym ent of renewables and behind-the-m eter technologies and the existence of new technologies that can be deployed to generate the electricity necessary to m eet custom er dem and. 2 2 2\n\nCurrently, the D uke E nergy R egistrants do not purchase carbon credits or offsets for use in connection with the C om pany's net-zero C O  em issions goals. T hough they m ay purchase carbon credits or offsets for such uses in the future, the am ount or cost of which is not expected to be m aterial at this tim e. 2\n\n## Generation Portfolio Planning Process\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IR P s. T hese detailed, highly technical plans are based on the C om pany's thorough analysis of num erous factors that can im pact the dem and for electricity as well as the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term  generation resource planning decisions. The IR P  process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account stakeholder input as well as forecasts of future electricity dem and, fuel prices, transm ission im provem ents, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, E E  and dem and response initiatives. T he IR P  process also helps evaluate potential environm ental and regulatory scenarios to better m itigate policy and econom ic risks. T he IR P s we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nI n 2021, the state of N orth C arolina passed H B 951, which am ong other things, directed the N C U C  to develop and approve a carbon reduction plan that would target a 70% reduction in C O  em issions from  D uke E nergy P rogress' and D uke E nergy C arolinas' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology. In D ecem ber 2022, the N C U C  issued an order adopting the first C arbon P lan as directed by H B 951 with the C arbon P lan to be updated every two years thereafter. 2\n\nI n August 2023, D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress filed their 2023 system wide C arolinas R esource P lan (the P lan) with the N C U C  and P SC SC . T he P lan provided a range of generation options, including three core portfolios, reflecting an 'all of the above' approach to powering the energy needs of our growing region. In the P lan, D uke E nergy Carolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress recom m ended one of the three core portfolios presented, P ortfolio 3, as the m ost prudent path forward to com ply with applicable state laws, providing a reliable and orderly energy transition that was proposed as the m ost reasonable and lowest-cost plan for the C arolinas. In N ovem ber 2023, D uke E nergy C arolinas and Duke E nergy P rogress provided notice to the N C U C  and P SC SC  of a substantially increased load forecast resulting from  increased econom ic developm ent in the C arolinas occurring since the P lan was prepared. The com panies filed supplem ental m odeling and analysis with the N C U C  and P SC SC  in January 2024, dem onstrating the need for additional resources beyond the initial set of resources identified by the com panies in their initial plan.\n\nI n J uly 2024, D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress reached a broad settlem ent in the N C U C  proceeding with the P ublic Staff, W alm art, and the C arolinas C lean E nergy Business Association on the P lan, agreeing it is reasonable to use P ortfolio 3 as the reference portfolio for planning purposes. Am ong other things, the settlem ent confirm s a set of near-term  activities, including developm ent and procurem ent activities for solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and certain natural gas generation assets, as well as certain lim ited actions exploring initial developm ent activities related to advanced nuclear, offshore wind, and to advance the potential for 1,834 M W  of pum ped storage hydro at the Bad C reek II facility by 2034. T he N C U C  conducted evidentiary hearings in July and August 2024 and issued an order accepting the settlem ent and providing further direction in N ovem ber 2024. The order continues to em phasize the critical im portance of reliability and m aintaining affordability, while taking balanced actions to m eet forecasted load growth. Additionally, the NCUC directed the C om pany to continue to pursue the m erger of D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress. As a condition of the N C U C  approval of the D uke E nergy and Progress E nergy m erger in 2012, the N C U C  instructed the C om pany to consider a m erger between D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress. Since that tim e, the C om pany has analyzed, and continues to analyze, the possibility of such a com bination, and the C om pany anticipates beginning m erger-related filings with the N C U C , P SC SC  and F E R C  in the second half of 2025. The C om pany is currently targeting a com pletion date for the m erger of January 1, 2027. T here is no assurance that the C om pany will be able to obtain the approval of the N C U C  or P SC SC , or other required regulatory approvals, for the potential m erger.\n\n",

See Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Equity Units\" for information on stock purchase contracts associated with Southern Company's equity units.\n\nThe Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as discussed further herein).\n\nThe amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2022, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See \"Cash Requirements\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2021, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for the Deuel Harvest wind facility, the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, and existing tax equity partnerships totaling $299 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under \"General\" and \"Southern Power,\" respectively, for additional information.\n\nThe issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.\n\nThe Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Bank Credit Arrangements\" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial paper program.\n\nSouthern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.\n\nBy regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2021, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.3 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.",

Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "Southern Power's 2022 investment in the Reading wind project, with a 12-year PPA contract period, initially positioned wind as a contracted, time-bound energy source. By 2024, the company's disclosure that wind assets have a useful life of up to 35 years indicates a strategic shift toward viewing wind as a durable, long-term generation asset rather than a short-duration contracted resource. This evolution suggests Southern Power is transitioning from treating wind as a project-specific, limited-duration investment (as seen with Reading in 2022) to a core, long-lived component of its generation portfolio by 2024.",

      "question": "How did NEE's exposure to risks in Power Sales Agreements in 2022 impact its financial obligations related to Wind Facilities in 2023, especially in light of NEER's increased capitalized development costs from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE identified significant risks tied to its Power Sales Agreements, including the potential for adverse impacts from delays, cost overruns, or termination payments, particularly for facilities dependent on long-term contracts. These risks were heightened for Wind Facilities, which are largely governed by such agreements, as noted in the 2023 filing where NEER reported approximately 28,759 MW of contracted generation capacity, including repowered wind facilities with power sales agreements averaging 15 years in remaining term. By 2023, NEER's capitalized development costs had increased from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, indicating a larger financial stake in projects like wind facilities. This increase amplified the potential financial obligations should any risks materialize, such as failure to complete projects on time or within budget, which could result in unrecoverable costs, loss of tax credits, or contractual liabilities. Therefore, the 2022-identified risks in Power Sales Agreements had a more pronounced financial impact in 2023 due to the increased investment in Wind Facilities through capitalized development costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Power Sales Agreements: NEE highlighted risks including potential delays, cost overruns, and termination liabilities tied to power sales agreements, especially for development projects.",
        "Hop 2: Power Sales Agreements \u2192 Wind Facilities: NEER's 2023 filing showed that wind facilities are largely governed by long-term power sales agreements, with an average remaining contract term of 15 years, linking the agreements directly to these facilities.",
        "Hop 3: Wind Facilities \u2190 NEE(2023): NEER's capitalized development costs increased to $1.5 billion in 2023, up from $1.0 billion in 2022, indicating a larger financial exposure to wind and other generation projects, which heightens the impact of any risks tied to their power sales agreements."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nNEE's  and  FPL's  provision  for  income  taxes  and  reporting  of  tax-related  assets  and  liabilities  require  significant  judgments  and  the  use  of estimates. Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and  the  ability  to  utilize  tax  benefit  carryforwards,  such  as  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.  Actual  income  taxes  could  vary significantly  from  estimated  amounts  due  to  the  future  impacts  of,  among  other  things,  changes  in  tax  laws,  guidance  or  policies,  including changes in corporate income tax rates, the financial condition and results of operations of NEE and FPL, and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities. These factors, including the ultimate resolution of income tax matters, may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's  and  FPL's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  prospects  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  due  to adverse results of litigation.\n\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially affected by adverse results of litigation. Unfavorable resolution of legal or administrative proceedings in which NEE or FPL is involved or other future legal or administrative proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\n\n## Development and Operational Risks\n\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer if NEE and FPL do not proceed with projects  under  development  or  are  unable  to  complete  the  construction  of,  or  capital  improvements  to,  electric  generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget.\n\nNEE's and FPL's ability to proceed with projects under development and to complete construction of, and capital improvement projects for, their electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities on schedule and within budget may be adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance, inability to obtain or renew necessary licenses, rightsof-way,  permits  or  other  approvals  on  acceptable  terms  or  on  schedule,  disputes  involving  contractors,  labor  organizations,  land  owners, governmental  entities,  environmental  groups,  Native American  and  aboriginal  groups,  lessors,  joint  venture  partners  and  other  third  parties, negative publicity, transmission interconnection issues, supply chain disruptions and other factors. For example, the ability of NEE and FPL to develop  solar  generation  facilities  is  dependent  on  the  international  supply  chain  for  solar  panels  and  associated  equipment,  and  regulatory actions have caused minor, and could in the future cause material, disruptions in the ability of NEE and FPL to acquire solar panels on time and at acceptable costs. If any development project or construction or capital improvement project is not completed, is delayed or is subject to cost overruns, certain associated costs may not be approved for recovery or otherwise be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms that may be available,  and  NEE  and  FPL  could  become obligated to make delay or termination payments or become obligated for other damages under contracts, could experience the loss of tax credits or tax incentives, or delayed or diminished returns, and could be required to write off all or a portion  of  their  investment  in  the  project. Any  of  these  events  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NEE's  and  FPL's  business,  financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE and FPL face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.\n\nNEE and FPL own, develop, construct, manage and operate electric generation and transmission facilities and natural gas transmission facilities. A key component of NEE's and FPL's growth is their ability to construct and operate generation and transmission facilities to meet customer needs. As part of these operations, NEE and FPL must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. Should NEE or FPL be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances on NEE or FPL, NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third parties could have similar results.\n\nThe  operation  and  maintenance  of  NEE's  and  FPL's  electric  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  facilities,  gas  infrastructure facilities, retail gas distribution system in Florida and other facilities are subject to many operational risks, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities, retail gas distribution system in Florida and other facilities are subject to many operational risks. Operational risks could result in, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures or legal claims, liability to third parties for property and personal injury damage or loss of life, a failure to perform under applicable power sales agreements or other agreements and associated loss of revenues from terminated agreements or liability for liquidated",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's financial exposure to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 overruns change from 2022 to 2023 following agreements with other Vogtle Owners, and what were the specific cost-sharing implications for Georgia Power?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (via Georgia Power) faced increasing exposure to cost overruns at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Georgia Power responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs exceeding $1.6 billion up to $2.1 billion over the VCM 19 Forecast Amount, resulting in an additional $100 million liability. By 2023, Georgia Power entered into agreements with other Vogtle Owners (MEAG Power, OPC, and Dalton) to resolve disputes over cost-sharing. These agreements included Georgia Power making immediate payments of $308 million and $17 million to OPC and Dalton, respectively, and committing to pay approximately $105 million and $6 million more based on the current project capital cost forecast. Additionally, Georgia Power agreed to cover 66% of future cost overruns beyond the current forecast. This significantly increased Georgia Power\u2019s direct financial burden, with a pre-tax charge of $160 million recorded in Q3 2023 alone, compared to $407 million in 2022. The evolution shows a shift from potential ownership dilution via tender options to Georgia Power assuming greater direct responsibility for the project\u2019s escalating costs.",

Broader use of distributed generation by retail energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, a state PSC or legislature may modify certain aspects of the traditional electric operating companies' business as a result of these advances in technology, which may provide for further competition from these alternative sources of generation.\n\nIt is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing similar services in Southern Company Gas' unregulated service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia. Southern Company Gas competes with natural gas facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., where the majority of the existing and proposed high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage facilities in North America are located.\n\nIf new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution and storage facilities could be reduced. Additionally, these technology and customer-induced changes to the electric generation business models could change the risk profile of the Southern Company system's historical capital investments. Southern Company Gas' market share could be reduced if Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets.\n\n## The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.\n\nThe Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, increased cost or reduced supply of labor, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including workforce needs associated with major construction projects and ongoing operations. The Southern Company system may be subject to workforce trends occurring in the United States triggered by decisions of employees to leave the workforce and/or their employer at higher rates as compared to prior years. The Southern Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses.\n\n## The Registrants are subject to risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, disruption to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for Southern Company and Georgia Power.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most jurisdictions, including in the United States, initially instituted restrictions on travel, public gatherings, and non-essential business operations. While some jurisdictions, including some in the Southern Company system's service territory, have relaxed some of these restrictions, some remain and there is no guarantee restrictions will not be reimposed in the future. These restrictions, as well as changes in individual behavior in response to the pandemic, have significantly disrupted economic activity in the service territories of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities and caused volatility in capital markets at certain periods during 2020 and 2021 and could continue to do so in the future. The Registrants cannot predict the extent or duration of the pandemic, the impact of new variants of COVID-19, the timing, availability, distribution, or effectiveness of vaccines, anti-virals, or other treatments or preventions for COVID-19, governmental responsive measures, including vaccine mandates, or the extent of the effects or impacts on the global, national, or local economy, the capital markets, or the Subsidiary Registrants' customers, suppliers, or operations.\n\nThe effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include new or extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, further reduced labor availability and productivity, and new or prolonged reductions in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Registrants, including, but not limited to, new or prolonged reductions in demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, reductions in investments recorded at fair value, further increases in costs of necessary equipment, and further challenges to the development, construction, and/or operation of the Registrants' facilities, including electric generation, transmission, and distribution assets, the performance of necessary corporate and customer service functions, and access to funds from financial institutions and capital markets.\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NextEra Energy Capital Holdings issued Series P Junior Subordinated Debentures due March 15, 2082 (filed December 14, 2021), and entered into a Purchase Contract Agreement dated September 1, 2022. These actions reflected continued use of the Replacement Capital Covenant originally dated September 19, 2006, and amended November 9, 2016, to support long-dated subordinated debt instruments. In 2024, the company issued a new set of debentures with varied maturities and interest rates, including 4.85% Debentures due 2028, 5.05% Debentures due 2030, and 5.90% Debentures due 2055.

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's use of tax-exempt bonds in 2023 relate to its financial contributions to Indiana in 2024, and what does this imply about the company's capital allocation strategy toward that state?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy reported $352 million in tax-exempt bonds maturing between 2027 and 2046, specifically tied to Duke Energy Indiana, which is part of its broader debt structure. By 2024, Duke Energy Indiana received $8 million in contributions from the company, consistent with the prior year. This suggests that while Duke Energy maintained a steady level of direct financial support to Indiana in 2024, the prior year's use of tax-exempt financing indicates a capital strategy aimed at funding long-term infrastructure or projects in the state at favorable interest terms. The continuity in contributions, despite access to favorable debt instruments, implies a balanced approach to capital allocation\u2014supporting Indiana through both investment and stable philanthropic commitments.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 Tax-exempt bonds: Duke Energy disclosed $352 million in tax-exempt bonds tied to Duke Energy Indiana, maturing between 2027 and 2046.",
        "Hop 2: Tax-exempt bonds \u2192 Indiana: The tax-exempt bonds are specifically disclosed under Duke Energy Indiana's liabilities, indicating a direct financial link between the debt instrument and the state.",

      "question": "How did the change in Southern Company's use of energy-related derivatives designated as regulatory hedges from 2022 to 2023 affect the recognition of gains and losses in fuel expense under their fuel-hedging programs?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's energy-related derivatives were largely designated as regulatory hedges, with gains and losses initially recorded as regulatory liabilities or assets and later included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel was used (from Hop 1 and Hop 2). By 2023, the company disclosed the pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, indicating a shift in strategy where some derivatives were recognized directly in income rather than being deferred under regulatory mechanisms (from Hop 3). This evolution suggests a reduced reliance on regulatory hedges and a more immediate financial impact on fuel expense in 2023 compared to 2022.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Regulatory Hedges: Southern Company used regulatory hedges to defer gains and losses related to fuel-hedging programs, with $2.0 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure mentioned.",

See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.\n\nEnergy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:\n\n- Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.\n- Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.\n- Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.\n\nSome energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.",

The additional estimated costs to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology primarily relate to inputs from contractor bids, design revisions, and changes in the expected volume of ash handling. During 2021, Alabama Power recorded increases totaling approximately $406 million to its AROs primarily related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule based on updated estimates for post-closure costs at its ash ponds and inflation rates.\n\nDuring the third quarter 2020, Georgia Power refined the cost estimates related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule, including updates to long-term post-closure care requirements, market pricing, and timing of future cash outlays and recorded an increase of approximately $411 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In September 2021, Georgia Power recorded a further increase of approximately $435 million to these AROs based on updated estimates for inflation rates and the timing of closure activities.\n\nIn September 2021, Mississippi Power recorded an increase of approximately $31 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule based on updated estimates for the timing of closure activities, post-closure costs at one of its ash ponds, and inflation rates.\n\nThe cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2021 using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted.

While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers, neither Southern Company nor its subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated thirdparty managers with oversight by the management of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The Funds' managers are authorized, within certain investment guidelines, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the return on the Funds' investments.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's (SO) financial relationship with Nicor Gas evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of impairment charges and notes payable balances?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company reported a pre-tax impairment charge of $96 million related to Nicor Gas due to disallowed capital investments. By 2024, Nicor Gas' notes payable balance decreased from $392 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024, with an improved weighted average interest rate dropping from 5.5% to 4.6%. This suggests a strategic reduction in debt and improved financing conditions for Nicor Gas within the Southern Company Gas segment.",

      "question": "How did the continued use of the Reduced Disclosure Format by Mississippi Power Company in 2024 reflect a consistent regulatory strategy by Southern Company, compared to its 2022 reporting structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mississippi Power Company, a subsidiary of Southern Company (SO), filed its Form 10-K using the Reduced Disclosure Format as part of a broader regulatory strategy shared among Southern Company's subsidiaries, including Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas. This format allowed these entities to streamline disclosures under General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K, while still meeting the conditions outlined in General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b). By 2024, Southern Company maintained this approach, with Mississippi Power Company again filing under the same Reduced Disclosure Format. This consistency in using the reduced format across both years indicates a deliberate and ongoing regulatory and compliance strategy by Southern Company to manage reporting obligations across its subsidiaries efficiently, without altering the disclosure framework despite the passage of two years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Mississippi Power Company: Southern Company had a stake in Mississippi Power Company, which filed its 10-K separately using the reduced disclosure format in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Mississippi Power Company \u2192 Reduced Disclosure Format: Mississippi Power was eligible and opted to use the Reduced Disclosure Format under General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K in 2022.",
        "Hop 3: Reduced Disclosure Format \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Southern Company's subsidiary Mississippi Power Company again used the same Reduced Disclosure Format, showing continuity in regulatory strategy."

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas maintained a 50% undivided ownership in the Dalton Pipeline through a lease agreement with The Williams Companies, Inc., paying approximately $26 million annually through 2042.

By 2023, this arrangement remained intact, but the pipeline was explicitly categorized under Southern Company Gas' 'gas pipeline investments' segment, which includes joint ventures like the Dalton Pipeline that provide diverse natural gas supply sources.

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE consolidated solar facilities totaling approximately 772 MW with assets valued at $1,851 million. By 2023, the company had increased its PPA-related guarantees to approximately $6.1 billion, reflecting a significant rise in exposure tied to power generation facilities. This suggests that as NEE expanded its solar portfolio, it also took on greater financial obligations under PPAs, indicating a strategic shift toward larger commitments in renewable energy projects. The connection between the growth in solar assets and the increase in PPA guarantees highlights NEE\u2019s deepening risk exposure through long-term contractual obligations.",

The difference for both years is net of an approximately $1.5 billion impairment charge  in  2020  related  to  NextEra  Energy  Resources'  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2022,  NextEra  Energy  Resources  recorded  an  additional impairment  charge  to  completely  write  off  its  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline.  See  Note  4  -  Nonrecurring  Fair  Value  Measurements  for  a  discussion  of  the  impairment charges.\n\nNextEra  Energy  Resources  provides  operational,  management  and  administrative  services  as  well  as  transportation  and  fuel  management services to NEP and its subsidiaries under various agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a cash sweep and credit support (CSCS) agreement with a subsidiary of NEP. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash sweep amounts (due to NEP and its subsidiaries)  held  in  accounts  belonging  to  NextEra  Energy  Resources  or  its  subsidiaries  were  approximately  $57  million  and  $10  million, respectively,  and  are  included  in  accounts  payable.  Fee  income  related  to  the  CSCS  agreement  and  the  service  agreements  totaled approximately $148 million, $120 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in operating revenues in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Amounts due from NEP of approximately $113 million and $68 million are included  in  other  receivables  and  $40  million  and  $32  million  are  included  in  noncurrent  other  assets  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.  See  also  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests  for  amounts  due  to  NEP  for reimbursement of construction-related costs. NEECH or NextEra Energy Resources guaranteed or provided indemnifications, letters of credit or surety bonds totaling approximately $3,778 million at December 31, 2021 primarily related to obligations on behalf of NEP's subsidiaries with maturity  dates  ranging  from  2022  to  2059,  including  certain  project  performance  obligations,  obligations  under  financing  and  interconnection agreements and obligations, primarily incurred and future construction payables, associated with the December 2021 sale of projects to NEP (see Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests). Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. At December 31, 2021, approximately $41 million related to the fair value of the credit support provided under the CSCS agreement is recorded as noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## 9. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\n\nNEER - At  December 31, 2021, NEE consolidates a number of VIEs within the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered  the  primary  beneficiary  of  these  VIEs  since  they  control  the  most  significant  activities  of  these  VIEs,  including  operations  and maintenance, and they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.\n\nEight indirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have an ownership interest ranging from approximately 50% to 67% in entities which own and operate solar facilities with the capability of producing a total of approximately 772 MW. Each of the subsidiaries is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates ranging from 2035 through 2052. These entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $1,851 million and $1,258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. There were three of these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2020, and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $751 million and $607 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.\n\nNEE consolidates a NEET VIE that is constructing an approximately 280-mile electricity transmission line.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's operational footprint in Alabama in 2022 relate to its investment in SNG in 2023, and what does this imply about the company's strategic positioning in natural gas infrastructure across the two years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company operated in Alabama through its traditional electric operating company, Alabama Power, which was part of the vertically integrated utility structure serving three Southeastern states. By 2023, Southern Company, through its subsidiary Southern Company Gas, maintained a 50% joint venture interest in SNG, a major natural gas pipeline that connects supply basins in Alabama and other Southern states to regional markets. This indicates a continued strategic emphasis on natural gas infrastructure, with Alabama serving as both an operational and infrastructural hub. The persistence of Alabama's role, combined with the ongoing investment in SNG, suggests Southern Company's deliberate integration of gas supply logistics with its broader energy distribution strategy in 2023, building on its existing regional presence from 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "question": "How did the LIFO inventory valuation method at Nicor Gas impact Southern Company's gas cost recovery mechanisms in 2024 compared to 2023, given the changes in inventory balances and replacement costs?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Nicor Gas maintained its natural gas inventory using the LIFO basis, with a reported LIFO inventory balance of $186 million and an estimated replacement cost of $268 million. This $82 million difference between LIFO balance and replacement cost reflects the potential impact of inflationary pricing or inventory layer liquidation effects during that year. By 2024, the LIFO inventory balance increased slightly to $188 million, while the estimated replacement cost rose significantly to $326 million, indicating a $138 million gap. This widening of the replacement cost over LIFO balance suggests higher market gas prices in 2024, which would have increased the cost of gas recovered from customers under Nicor Gas' purchased gas recovery mechanism. Therefore, the LIFO method continued to insulate Southern Company\u2019s net income from these rising costs, as the recovery mechanism adjusted for differences between actual costs and amounts billed, directly influencing the gas cost recovery in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Nicor Gas: SO reported a $96 million pre-tax charge associated with Nicor Gas related to disallowed capital investments in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Nicor Gas \u2192 LIFO Basis: Nicor Gas uses the LIFO basis for natural gas inventory valuation, where inventory decrements are charged at either replacement cost or actual LIFO cost depending on whether they are restored by year-end.",
        "Hop 3: LIFO Basis \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Nicor Gas\u2019 LIFO inventory balance increased slightly to $188 million, while the estimated replacement cost rose significantly to $326 million, reflecting higher gas prices and impacting SO\u2019s cost recovery mechanisms."

Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes the average cost of propane gas inventory, liquefied natural gas inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies. Materials and supplies for Southern Power generally includes the average cost of generating plant materials.\n\nMaterials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.\n\n## Fuel Inventory\n\nFuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and emissions allowances. Fuel inventory for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil, natural gas, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost, as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric operating companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.\n\n## Natural Gas for Sale\n\nWith the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a weighted average cost of gas basis. In Georgia's deregulated, competitive environment, Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a monthly basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract, along with a corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets and related natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.\n\nNicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted for differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income. At December 31, 2024, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was $188 million. Based on the average cost of gas purchased in December 2024, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at December 31, 2024 was $326 million.\n\n## Provision for Uncollectible Accounts\n\nThe customers of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are billed monthly. For the majority of receivables, a provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on historical collection ex perience and other factors. For the remaining receivables, if the company is aware of a specific customer's inability to pay, a provision for",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company's other business activities included PowerSecure, which produces distributed energy solutions. By 2024, PowerSecure had become a key entity that SO depended on, particularly for distributed infrastructure projects. This strategic shift was reflected in SO's 2024 financials, where PowerSecure contributed a $120 million increase in operating revenues and an $82 million increase in cost of other sales, both directly tied to distributed infrastructure projects. The evolution of this relationship indicates a deeper integration and reliance on PowerSecure to drive growth in SO's distributed energy segment.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Distributed Energy Solutions: Southern Company's 2023 financials identified PowerSecure as the entity that produces distributed energy and resilience solutions.",

        "Hop 3: PowerSecure \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, SO's financial performance showed a significant dependency on PowerSecure, with $120 million in revenue growth and $82 million in cost increases directly attributed to distributed infrastructure projects."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's reliance on PowerSecure for distributed infrastructure projects evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what role did the deployment of microgrids play in this shift, given the 20.0% ($111M) increase in PowerSecure-related operating revenues in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company identified microgrids as a disruptive technology that could challenge its traditional centralized power generation model, noting that distributed energy resources like microgrids could reduce the value of existing assets and change the risk profile of capital investments. By 2024, Southern Company's subsidiary PowerSecure had significantly increased its activity in distributed infrastructure projects, which contributed to a 20.0% ($111M) year-over-year increase in operating revenues for 'other business activities.' This growth indicates that Southern Company not only acknowledged the threat posed by microgrids but also strategically leaned into this technology by leveraging PowerSecure, which installs and deploys microgrids, to capture value from the shift toward distributed energy solutions. The increased reliance on PowerSecure reflects a strategic pivot to integrate microgrid capabilities into Southern Company's broader energy offerings.",

Southern Linc's system covers approximately 122,000 square miles in the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary, which invests in various projects. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nSee \"The Southern Company System\" herein for additional information. Also see Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding recent acquisition and disposition activity. Segment information for the Registrants is included in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each operate with one reportable business segment, since substantially all of their business is providing electric service to customers. Southern Power also operates its business with one reportable business segment, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market.\n\nThe Registrants' Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are made available on Southern Company's website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Southern Company's internet address is www.southerncompany.com.\n\n## The Southern Company System\n\n## Traditional Electric Operating Companies\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the state of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see \"Territory Served by the Southern Company System - Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power\" herein.\n\nAgreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance",

These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\n\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $237 million and $770 million of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The storm recovery property was created by state legislation and NCUC financing orders for the purpose of financing storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. The storm recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from all Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The storm recovery bonds are secured by the storm recovery property and cash collections from the storm recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress. For additional information, see Notes 3 and 6.\n\nDECNCSF and DEPNCSF are considered VIEs primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations.

By 2023, lease income from PPAs\u2014particularly for Alabama Power and Southern Power\u2014was explicitly included in wholesale revenues, indicating a strategic alignment between renewable investments and revenue generation through structured long-term contracts.

By 2024, while the classification of debt investments as AFS remained consistent, the company reported realized gains and losses from AFS securities as immaterial, suggesting a more passive management approach compared to 2022.

See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.\n\nEnergy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:\n\n- Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.\n- Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.\n- Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.\n\nSome energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in NEE's pension plan allocation to convertible securities from 2022 to 2024 reflect a strategic shift in the use of Convertible LPs within the broader investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan allocated 10% of its target asset allocation to convertible securities, including investments in a convertible security-oriented limited partnership (Convertible LP). By 2024, this allocation had decreased to 5%, indicating a reduced emphasis on convertible securities. This shift suggests that NEE may have adjusted its pension fund strategy to de-prioritize Convertible LPs as part of a broader rebalancing that increased the allocation to alternative investments from 13% to 20%. The change implies a strategic reallocation to potentially reduce volatility or adapt to market conditions while maintaining diversification and liquidity.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's use of storm recovery bonds in 2022 compare with its storm recovery property acquisition in 2023, and what does this reveal about the company's financing strategy for storm-related costs?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy introduced storm recovery bonds through its subsidiaries DECNCSF and DEPNCSF, issuing $237 million and $770 million respectively to finance unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs from 2018 and 2019. The proceeds were used to acquire storm recovery property, which granted the right to collect non-bypassable charges from retail customers. In 2023, the company continued to rely on this structure, with the storm recovery property still serving as the sole collateral and funding source for the bonds. This reveals a consistent financing strategy where Duke Energy leverages securitization of future customer charges to recover storm-related costs without exposing the parent company to direct liability.",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

Achievement of these goals is dependent on various factors, many of which the Southern Company system does not control, including load growth across the Southern Company system's service territory, energy policy and regulations, natural gas prices, and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to economically transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet through a diverse portfolio of resources including low-carbon and carbon-free resources; making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing to implement effective energy efficiency and demand response programs; customer demand for carbon-free energy; implementing initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution emissions; continuing research and development with a focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future. There is no guarantee that the Southern Company system will achieve these goals.\n\nSee MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters - Environmental Laws and Regulations -Greenhouse Gases\" in Item 7 herein for additional information.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, inability to maintain reliability consistent with customer ex pectations as the traditional electric operating companies transition their generating fleets in support of the Southern Company system's net zero goal, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and catastrophic events such as fires, including wildfires, earthquakes, ex plosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, wars, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, six nuclear units. The eight units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 25% and 34% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2024. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives or license extensions and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and significant capital ex penditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a major nuclear incident were to occur, it",

D uke E nergy is working to m eet growing and evolving custom er energy needs while balancing custom er reliability and affordability, and other priorities including the need to m odernize its fleet and the regulatory construct. D uke E nergy is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, econom ic and com petitive uncertainties and contingencies, m any of which are beyond its control and may m ake those goals difficult to achieve.\n\nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable D uke E nergy to reduce its carbon em issions. F or exam ple, D uke E nergy anticipates that its nuclear stations in N orth C arolina and South C arolina will continue to qualify for significant tax incentives in the form  of nuclear production tax credits under the IR A. N uclear energy is a reliable and clean energy source and nuclear tax incentives allowed under the IR A, including nuclear production tax credits, are expected to reduce the cost of the energy transition for our custom ers. If such nuclear production tax credits were elim inated or reduced, it could negatively im pact our ability to return the anticipated cost benefits to custom ers.\n\nAdditionally, new E P A rules issued in April 2024 im pose stringent G H G  em ission reduction standards, revised air toxic lim its, and wastewater discharge lim itations that m ay im pact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational tim eline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies m ay be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transm ission and distribution upgrades needed to accom m odate the build out of large volum es of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the C om pany to continue to retire existing carbon em itting assets or m ake investm ents in new generating capacity. T he C om pany m ay be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on tim e. In addition, new technologies that are not yet com m ercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, D uke E nergy's ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\n\nMeeting the evolving and growing energy needs of our custom ers will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, m ay challenge our ability to m eet custom er expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environm ent, particularly as dem and increases. O ur nuclear fleet is central to our ability to m eet these objectives and custom er expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond m idcentury. F ailure to receive approval from  the N R C  for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\n\nAs a consequence, D uke E nergy m ay not be able to fully im plem ent or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which m ay have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\n\n## REGULATORY, LE GISLATIVE  AND LE GAL R ISK S\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of N orth C arolina, South C arolina, F lorida, O hio, T ennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility com m issions, retail electric and natural gas rates m ay be subject to review and possible reduction by the com m issions, which m ay decrease the D uke E nergy R egistrants' earnings. Additionally, if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a tim ely basis, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be negatively im pacted. D ifferences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as N orth C arolina and South C arolina in D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' service territory, m ay also result in failure to recover costs.\n\nI f legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the D uke E nergy R egistrants' exclusive rights to serve their regulated custom ers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively im pacted. F ederal and state regulations, laws, com m ercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to prom ote and expand the use of E E measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in D uke E nergy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in D uke E nergy service territories or result in custom ers leaving the electric distribution system  and an increase in custom er net energy m etering, which allows custom ers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit am ount. O ver tim e, custom er adoption of these technologies could result in D uke E nergy not being able to fully recover the costs and investm ent in generation.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nuncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.\n\nCredit risk ex posure at Nicor G as is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 14 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk ex posure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest ex posure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit ex posure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, and interest rates. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets (included in \"Other\" or shown separately as \"Risk Management Activities\") and are measured at fair value. See Note 13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and Southern Company Gas' bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are ex cluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the \"normal\" scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.\n\nThe Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nThe purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's change in total notes payable for Nicor Gas from 2023 to 2024 reflect shifts in Nicor Gas's role within Southern Company's broader gas segment financing strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company reported $392 million in notes payable for Nicor Gas at a 5.5% weighted average interest rate, while in 2024, this amount decreased to $172 million at a lower 4.6% rate. This reflects a strategic shift in Nicor Gas's role within Southern Company's gas segment financing, as evidenced by the 2024 disclosure that Nicor Gas was now operating under a $700 million credit arrangement (part of a larger $800 million facility) restricted for its working capital needs, compared to no such specific facility being mentioned in 2023. The reduced notes payable and lower interest rate suggest a more targeted and cost-efficient financing approach for Nicor Gas in 2024, aligned with Southern Company Gas's broader $2.45 billion combined arrangement allowing flexible sublimits.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

By 2023, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana both continued to classify debt investments as AFS, with no indication of material realized gains or losses from AFS securities during the year, suggesting a consistent investment approach.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's financial obligations related to MEAG Power's stake in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 change between the 2022 and 2023 disclosures, particularly in terms of cost recovery and funding commitments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's subsidiary Georgia Power had a dependency on MEAG Power, which held a 5% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, with Georgia Power having $42 million in capacity purchase commitments. There was also a forward-looking concern about Georgia Power potentially needing to fund MEAG Power\u2019s interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, particularly related to JEA\u2019s portion, without guaranteed repayment. By 2023, Georgia Power had moved from a potential funding concern to a concrete cost recovery framework, having received approval to recover $7.562 billion in total construction and capital costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, along with $1.02 billion in associated retail rate base items. This evolution shows a shift from contingent liability to a structured recovery mechanism, indicating that the earlier concerns about MEAG Power\u2019s stake were partially resolved through regulatory approval and cost allocation.",

        "Hop 1: [SO](2022) \u2192 [MEAG Power]: Southern Company (via Georgia Power) had a dependency on MEAG Power due to its ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, with $42 million in capacity purchase commitments and potential future funding obligations.",
        "Hop 2: [MEAG Power] \u2192 [Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4]: MEAG Power had a stake in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, particularly involving JEA, raising concerns about Georgia Power's potential obligation to fund MEAG Power\u2019s interest without guaranteed repayment.",
        "Hop 3: [Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4] \u2190 [SO](2023): In 2023, Georgia Power disclosed it was approved to recover $7.562 billion in construction costs and $1.02 billion in associated rate base items for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, indicating a transition from contingent funding to actual cost recovery."

See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner holding the same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 76,289 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.",

      "question": "How did the cost of nuclear-related services provided by Southern Nuclear to Georgia Power change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this trend indicate about SO's nuclear construction management expenses tied to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power incurred $895 million in costs for nuclear-related services from Southern Nuclear, which decreased slightly to $899 million in 2023. This reflects continued reliance on Southern Nuclear for critical construction management and operational support for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The relatively stable cost trend suggests ongoing execution of the nuclear expansion project despite earlier financial pressures seen in 2022 under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, including cost-sharing provisions and potential additional charges.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Southern Nuclear: Georgia Power was subject to cost-sharing and tender provisions under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, with Southern Nuclear managing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and Georgia Power incurring $895 million in service costs in 2022.",

In January 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).\n\nPursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more from the seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8 under \"Long-term Debt - DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\" for additional information.\n\nGeorgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact the calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other V ogtle Owners have asserted that the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the Global Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February 14, 2022.",

These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\n\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $237 million and $770 million of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The storm recovery property was created by state legislation and NCUC financing orders for the purpose of financing storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. The storm recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from all Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The storm recovery bonds are secured by the storm recovery property and cash collections from the storm recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2022 disclosure of cyber intrusion risks to nuclear operations influence its 2023 strategic investments in nuclear power plant management and construction, particularly regarding Plant Vogtle Unit 4?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company explicitly identified cyber intrusions as a material risk to its nuclear power operations, noting that such threats could lead to increased compliance costs and potential operational disruptions at nuclear facilities like those operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Despite these acknowledged risks, the 2023 filing revealed that Southern Nuclear continued to manage the construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Unit 4, indicating a strategic decision to maintain and expand its nuclear portfolio. This suggests that the company either implemented enhanced cybersecurity measures or accepted the risk as part of its broader energy infrastructure strategy. The continuation of Vogtle Unit 4 construction demonstrates a calculated balance between risk mitigation and long-term energy planning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Cyber Intrusions: Southern Company's 2022 filing explicitly cited cyber intrusions as a significant risk to nuclear operations, noting potential regulatory and operational impacts.",
        "Hop 2: Cyber Intrusions \u2192 Nuclear Power Plants: Cybersecurity threats were specifically tied to nuclear facilities, with implications for licensing, compliance, and operational continuity.",
        "Hop 3: Nuclear Power Plants \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Southern Nuclear was actively managing the construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Unit 4, signaling ongoing strategic investment in nuclear generation despite earlier cyber risk disclosures."

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

By 2024, the alternative investment allocation increased to 20%, with continued emphasis on limited partnerships as a key investment vehicle. This increase in alternative investments suggests a strategic shift toward more diversified and potentially higher-return assets, with limited partnerships remaining a core component of the pension plan's investment structure. The continued inclusion of a convertible security-oriented limited partnership in 2024 indicates sustained confidence in this vehicle despite the overall reduction in the convertible securities allocation from 10% to 5%.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Limited Partnerships: NEE disclosed that its pension plan utilized limited partnerships as part of its investment vehicles, particularly in alternative investments (13%) and convertible securities (10%).",
        "Hop 2: Limited Partnerships \u2192 Pension Plan: Limited partnerships are included in the pension plan's investment strategy as part of broader diversified arrangements, including private equity, real estate, and convertible securities.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's investment in Chattanooga Gas' Pipeline Replacement Program evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the program's funding progression and regulatory recovery mechanism?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's Chattanooga Gas subsidiary had spent $2 million in the Pipeline Replacement Program, with total estimated costs of $118 million to be recovered through annual base rate reviews over a seven-year period. By 2023, the program remained in place with no new expenditures explicitly reported, suggesting a continuation of the same $118 million plan. This indicates that the program's funding progression remained steady, relying on the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission-approved base rate review mechanism rather than a rider or accelerated recovery approach seen in other Southern Company gas utilities like Virginia Natural Gas. The lack of updated expenditure figures implies a consistent, long-term investment strategy with stable regulatory support.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAtlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC.\n\nSee \"Rate Proceedings - Atlanta Gas Light\" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 18, 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024.\n\n## Chattanooga Gas\n\nIn June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.\n\n## Natural Gas Cost Recovery\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, the over recovered balance was $88 million, which was included in other regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.\n\n## Rate Proceedings\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.\n\nIn July 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of $37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2023 impairment charges at Nicor Gas impact the subsidiary's retained earnings available for dividend payments in 2024, and what does this suggest about the financial constraints facing the gas segment under regulatory requirements?",
      "answer": "Southern Company recorded a $131 million pre-tax impairment charge ($99 million after tax) related to Nicor Gas' sale of natural gas storage facilities in 2023, which reduced the subsidiary's retained earnings. By December 31, 2024, this contributed to a regulatory restriction limiting Nicor Gas' available retained earnings for dividend payments to affiliates at $1.6 billion. This reflects how impairment charges directly constrain a regulated utility's ability to distribute capital under the dividend restriction framework, impacting Southern Company's overall cash flow strategy.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Nicor Gas: SO recognized a $131 million pre-tax impairment charge related to Nicor Gas' assets",

      "question": "What does Georgia Power's 2024 regulatory asset disclosure indicate about Southern Company's ongoing exposure to cost recovery risk first identified in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company explicitly identified the 'Risk of Non-Recovery of Costs' as a critical audit matter, noting that its regulated utility subsidiaries\u2014including Georgia Power\u2014face uncertainty regarding the recovery of incurred costs and investments through regulated rates. This risk was tied to regulatory decisions by the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could disallow recovery of certain costs or investments, impacting financial performance and regulatory asset balances. In 2024, Georgia Power\u2019s audited financial statements referenced in SO_10k_2024.pdf (page 132) reaffirmed this risk and included regulatory asset balances related to unapproved incurred costs. Specifically, Note 2 (Regulatory Matters) detailed $2.1 billion in regulatory assets as of December 31, 2024, of which $450 million remained subject to pending regulatory decisions. This indicates that Southern Company\u2019s exposure to cost recovery risk not only persisted from 2023 to 2024 but also remained material, with significant portions of Georgia Power\u2019s incurred costs still awaiting final regulatory approval. The continuation of this risk underscores ongoing regulatory scrutiny and potential financial impacts on Southern Company\u2019s capital recovery and earnings stability.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

          "chunk_text": "claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO and other emissions, CCR, releases of regulated substances, alleged exposure to regulated substances, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 2\n\nCompliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Southern Company system. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, operational changes, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated and could adversely affect the Registrants if such costs cannot continue to be recovered on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas.\n\n## The Southern Company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals.\n\nConcern and activism about climate change continue to increase and, as a result, demand for energy conservation and sustainable assets could further increase. Additionally, costs associated with GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be significant.\n\nThe Southern Company system has robust processes for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks, including a scenario planning process that is used to inform resource planning decisions in the states in which the traditional electric operating companies operate. This process relies on information from internal and external sources, which may or may not be accurate in predicting future outcomes. Each year, the Southern Company system develops scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In 2021, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO  prices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of CO  emitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon. 2 2\n\nAdditional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG emitting economy. However, the ultimate impact will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, natural gas prices, the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies, the ability to recover costs through existing ratemaking provisions, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.\n\nBecause natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels, future carbon constraints, including, but not limited to, the imposition of a carbon tax, may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. However, such demand may be tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain situations, such as new construction. Additionally, efforts to electrify the transportation and building sectors may result in higher electric demand and negatively impact natural gas demand. Future GHG constraints, including those related to methane emissions, designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs to the Southern Company system and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas.\n\nSouthern Company has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continuing to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.\n\nSee MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters Global Climate Issues\" in Item 7 herein for additional information.",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods.

      "question": "How did the regulatory uncertainties surrounding Georgia Power's Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2022 evolve into financial statement disclosures and audit considerations by 2024, and what impact did this have on the evaluation of cost recovery and regulatory asset treatment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory uncertainties regarding the recovery of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including risks related to construction delays, cost overruns, and potential challenges from regulators and co-owners. These uncertainties led to a $1.692 billion pre-tax charge in 2021. By 2024, these matters had evolved into formal financial statement disclosures and became a focal point in the audit process, particularly around the treatment of regulatory assets and liabilities. The audit firm explicitly evaluated the impact of rate regulation on Georgia Power\u2019s financial statements, including how regulatory decisions by the Georgia Public Service Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission affected the recovery of costs and the reasonableness of management\u2019s disclosures. This shows a shift from uncertainty and risk assessment in 2022 to formalized financial reporting and audit scrutiny in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "- For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n- We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.\n- We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n- We evaluated Southern Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n## Disclosure of Uncertainties - Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction - Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power Company's (Georgia Power) investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery, including ongoing or future challenges with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and estimated cost.\n\nIn addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $1.692 billion in 2021.\n\nIn addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1) the status of construction; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project. We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n- We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the projected in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule and to assess the disclosures of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of these units.\n- We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors), independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and schedule challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company had a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward tax benefit tied to Florida, indicating a future tax planning focus on that state. By 2023, the company maintained a 50% interest in SNG, a major natural gas pipeline delivering supplies to Florida, reinforcing its operational footprint there. This suggests Southern Company strategically aligned its infrastructure investments in critical energy delivery assets like SNG with its long-term tax planning, leveraging continued operations in Florida to utilize future NOL benefits. The 2023 investment in SNG, which serves Florida markets, supports the company\u2019s ability to maintain and grow its presence in a state where it still had expiring NOL benefits starting in 2034.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mississippi Power Company, a subsidiary of The Southern Company, filed its 10-K using the reduced disclosure format under General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K, a structure also followed in 2023. This consistent use of the reduced disclosure format across both years indicates that Mississippi Power maintained its regulatory compliance strategy aligned with the parent company's broader approach, leveraging streamlined reporting requirements available to subsidiaries. The continuation of this format suggests no significant change in its internal governance or external disclosure obligations during this period.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company emphasized PowerSecure's role in providing distributed energy and resilience solutions, including microgrid deployment, as part of its broader energy portfolio. By 2024, this strategic focus translated into a $120 million increase in operating revenues at PowerSecure, primarily driven by distributed infrastructure projects. Correspondingly, the cost of other sales also rose by $82 million in 2024, reflecting the increased investment and operational activity in distributed energy solutions. This indicates that Southern Company's earlier year commitment to distributed energy was operationalized in 2024 through tangible project execution, resulting in significant revenue growth, albeit with associated cost increases.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Distributed Energy Solutions: Southern Company's 2023 filings highlight PowerSecure's role in distributed energy and resilience solutions, including microgrid deployment for commercial, industrial, and utility customers.",

BUSINESS\n\nSouthern Company is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and Southern Company Gas.\n\n- The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are each operating public utility companies providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.\n- Southern Power Company is also an operating public utility company. The term \"Southern Power\" when used herein refers to Southern Power Company and its subsidiaries, while the term \"Southern Power Company\" when used herein refers only to the Southern Power parent company. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.\n- Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas in four states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee - through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas.\n\nSouthern Company also owns SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SCS, the system service company, has contracted with Southern Company, each of the Subsidiary Registrants, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO, and other subsidiaries to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon request, the following services: general executive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern Company power pool transactions. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services through its subsidiary, Southern Telecom, Inc. Southern Linc's system covers approximately 122,000 square miles in the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary, which invests in various projects. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nSee \"The Southern Company System\" herein for additional information. Also see Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding recent acquisition and disposition activity. Segment information for the Registrants is included in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each operate with one reportable business segment, since substantially all of their business is providing electric service to customers. Southern Power also operates its business with one reportable business segment, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market.\n\nThe Registrants' Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are made available on Southern Company's website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the state of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see \"Territory Served by the Southern Company System - Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power\" herein.\n\nAgreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance",

The decrease was primarily due to investment losses at Southern Holdings. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company\" for additional information on Southern Holdings' equity method investments.",

      "question": "How did the shift in NEE's use of option models for power derivatives between 2022 and 2024 affect the fair value and implied volatility metrics of their Options - Power portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE reported a fair value of $52 million for Options - Power with a weighted-average implied volatility of 81%. By 2024, the fair value of Options - Power had decreased to $9 million in assets and $6 million in liabilities, while the weighted-average implied volatility significantly increased to 186%. This indicates that NEE's use of option models evolved to reflect higher volatility expectations in the power market, which likely contributed to the reduced fair value of these instruments due to increased risk premiums.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Option Models: NEE used option models to value its Options - Power portfolio, which had a fair value of $52 million with a weighted-average implied volatility of 81%.",
        "Hop 2: Option Models \u2192 Options - Power: The valuation technique for Options - Power explicitly relied on option models, with significant unobservable inputs including implied volatilities that ranged up to 368% in 2022 and increased further in 2024 to a weighted average of 186%.",
        "Hop 3: Options - Power \u2190 NEE(2024): By 2024, the fair value of Options - Power had declined to $9 million (assets) and $6 million (liabilities), while the implied volatility used in the option models had increased substantially."

      "answer": "In 2023, the Garland Solar Storage project had a battery energy storage capacity of 88 MW, supported by a 20-year PPA contract. By 2024, Southern Company continued to emphasize battery energy storage as part of its strategy, as evidenced by the inclusion of Garland Solar Storage in the completed projects section of the 2024 filing, maintaining the same 88 MW capacity and reaffirming the long-term contractual commitment. This consistency in capacity and contract duration indicates that SO maintained a stable approach to battery energy storage deployment, leveraging long-term PPAs to secure storage assets.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nacquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired.\n\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. For potential or successful acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, any due diligence or transaction costs incurred are ex pensed as incurred. If the acquisition is an asset acquisition, direct and incremental transaction costs can be capitalized as a component of the cost of the assets acquired.\n\nSee Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)\n\nSouthern Power has partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a V IE. If the legal entity is a V IE, Southern Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the V IE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the V IE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.\n\nIf Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in membership interests.\n\nSouthern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fix ed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.\n\n## Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Registrants.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\n## Overview\n\nThe financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2024. The Registrants' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital ex penditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to build new generation facilities to meet projected long-term demand requirements and to replace units being retired as part of the generation fleet transition, to maintain ex isting generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain ex isting generating units and closures of surface impoundments, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its ex isting generation fleet's performance. Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas transmission and distribution",

For Southern Power, these arrangements consist of PPAs related to electric generating units, including solar and wind facilities, accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 25 years and PPAs related to battery energy storage facilities accounted for as sales-type leases with remaining terms of up to 19 years. Southern Company Gas is the lessor in operating leases related to gas pipelines with remaining terms of up to 21 years.

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE reported fair value liabilities of $566 million for Full Requirements and Unit Contingent Contracts, with a weighted-average forward price of $64 per MWh. By 2024, these contracts were valued at $203 million in liabilities, with an increase in the weighted-average forward price to $76 per MWh. This shift indicates a significant decrease in the financial exposure associated with these contracts over the two-year period, despite an increase in the key pricing assumption used in the Discounted Cash Flow valuation.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's environmental compliance costs in 2023 influence electricity demand from commercial customers, and how did the company adjust its long-term power purchase agreements with these customers in 2024 to address this risk?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company highlighted that increased environmental compliance costs\u2014driven by regulations on emissions, waste disposal, and GHG reduction goals\u2014could lead to higher electricity prices, which in turn might reduce demand from commercial and industrial customers. These customers are directly impacted by environmental requirements, potentially altering their energy consumption patterns. In 2024, Southern Power, a key subsidiary, adjusted its long-term PPAs with commercial customers by incorporating flexible service models, such as requirements service agreements that allow for shared generation resources and dynamic capacity charges. Additionally, 46% of contracted MWs were with high-rated counterparties, indicating a strategic shift toward more stable and creditworthy commercial partners to mitigate contractual risk in the face of demand uncertainty.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Environmental Requirements: Southern Company faced rising compliance costs due to environmental regulations and GHG goals, which could affect electricity pricing.",
        "Hop 2: Environmental Requirements \u2192 Commercial Customers: These increased costs were expected to influence commercial customers' demand for electricity due to potential price sensitivity.",
        "Hop 3: Commercial Customers \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Power adapted by modifying its PPA structures and focusing on high-credit counterparties to manage demand volatility and ensure stable revenue."

In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 46% were with BBB+ to BBBor equivalent rated counterparties, and 6% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fix ed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 78,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. G as distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. SNG is developing a proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, which the operator of the joint venture anticipates will be completed by 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed $300 million in short-term bank debt for Nicor Gas at a 0.7% interest rate, indicating a direct financial dependency on short-term financing for its gas operations. This exposure became significant in 2023 when Nicor Gas faced a $96 million pre-tax disallowance charge on capital investments, which likely increased financial pressure due to prior debt obligations. The chain shows that the 2022 borrowing strategy directly influenced the 2023 financial risk profile, amplifying the impact of regulatory disallowances.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy implemented a three-year vesting schedule for the 4% additional employer contribution provided to new and rehired employees who are not eligible for defined benefit plans. This vesting framework directly informed the structure of RSU awards, which also generally vest over periods ranging from immediate to three years, as disclosed in 2024. The fair value of these RSU awards was based on the market price of Duke Energy\u2019s common stock on the grant date, aligning with the vesting timeline established in the 2023 savings plan. This connection indicates that the vesting schedule served as a foundational design element influencing how RSU awards were valued and timed in the following year.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 Vesting Schedule: Duke Energy introduced a 3-year vesting schedule for a 4% employer contribution in its savings plan.",
        "Hop 2: Vesting Schedule \u2192 RSU Awards: The vesting periods for RSU awards are aligned with similar timelines, including up to three years.",
        "Hop 3: RSU Awards \u2190 DUK(2024): In 2024, Duke Energy disclosed that RSU awards generally vest between immediate and three years, with fair value based on the stock price at grant date."

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company faced a $24 million financial impact from regulatory disallowances at Nicor Gas, which directly affected earnings. By 2024, this led to a structured credit arrangement strategy where $700 million of a $1.5 billion credit facility expiring in 2029 was specifically allocated to Nicor Gas for working capital needs. Additionally, Southern Company Gas guaranteed $800 million of this facility, indicating a strategic reallocation of financial resources to manage regulatory risks. The company also maintained compliance with debt covenants, limiting debt to 70% of total capitalization for entities like Nicor Gas, showing a proactive approach to financial risk management post-disallowance.",

S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "In 2022, SO completed the Tranquillity Solar Storage project, which added 72 MW of battery energy storage capacity in Fresno County, CA, with operations beginning in November 2021 and concluding in March 2022. This project, along with Garland Solar Storage (88 MW), marked SO's strategic move into battery energy storage systems as part of its broader renewable energy portfolio. By 2023, this capacity was fully integrated into SO's production mix, contributing to a total of 160 MW of battery energy storage capacity from both Garland and Tranquillity projects, indicating a deliberate expansion in energy storage solutions to complement intermittent renewable generation sources like wind. This reflects SO's evolving focus on enhancing grid reliability and optimizing energy dispatch through battery storage.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Tranquillity Solar Storage: SO introduced the 72 MW battery energy storage system in Fresno County, CA, with completion phases in late 2021 and early 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Tranquillity Solar Storage \u2192 Battery Energy Storage: The project represented a significant stake in battery energy storage, aligning with SO's broader renewable energy infrastructure investments.",
        "Hop 3: Battery Energy Storage \u2190 SO(2023): By 2023, SO had fully integrated battery energy storage into its production mix, with both Garland (88 MW) and Tranquillity (72 MW) contributing 160 MW of combined capacity."

      "answer": "In 2022, SO reported that its wind energy facilities had a useful life of up to 30 years, indicating a long-term commitment to wind as part of its generation portfolio. By 2023, the Glass Sands wind project\u2014completed in November 2021\u2014was listed with an 118 MW nameplate capacity and a 12-year PPA contract period. This suggests that while SO continued to develop wind projects, the duration of the PPA for Glass Sands was notably shorter than the asset's potential lifespan, potentially reflecting a shift in strategy toward shorter-term contractual arrangements despite the long-lived nature of wind infrastructure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Wind: SO's 2022 10-K stated that wind facilities have a useful life of up to 30 years, indicating long-term asset planning.",

        "Hop 3: Glass Sands \u2190 SO(2023): The 2023 filing shows that the Glass Sands project operates under a 12-year PPA, which is significantly shorter than the 30-year useful life of the facility itself."

      "answer": "In 2022, Wholesale Gas Services managed natural gas logistics and asset management for Southern Company Gas' utilities, including Nicor Gas, which contributed to operational efficiency and cost control. However, after the sale of Sequent (the entity under Wholesale Gas Services) on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas no longer had that internal wholesale function. By 2023, Nicor Gas faced a $96 million pre-tax disallowance of certain capital investments, suggesting regulatory pushback or inefficiencies in capital deployment post-wholesale services exit. This indicates a shift in strategy where Southern Company may have moved toward a more streamlined, regulated utility model, accepting short-term financial penalties in exchange for simplified operations or reduced exposure to market volatility.",

Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.\n\nThe number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.\n\n## Seasonality of Results\n\nDuring the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services' operating revenues occasionally were impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.\n\n",

Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments also included wholesale gas services. The non-reportable segments are combined and presented as all other. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on the disposition activities described herein.\n\nGas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and includes natural gas local distribution utilities that construct, manage, and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and gas distribution facilities in four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. Gas pipeline investments also includes a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline project, which was cancelled in September 2021, and through its March 24, 2020 sale, included a 5% ownership interest in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline construction project. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information.\n\nThrough July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services provided natural gas asset management and/or related logistics services for each of Southern Company Gas' utilities except Nicor Gas as well as for non-affiliated companies. Additionally, wholesale gas services engaged in natural gas storage and gas pipeline arbitrage and related activities.\n\nGas marketing services provides natural gas marketing to end-use customers primarily in Georgia and Illinois through SouthStar.\n\nThe all other column includes segments and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including storage and fuels operations. The all other column included Jefferson Island through its sale on December 1, 2020, Pivotal LNG through its sale on March 24, 2020, and the investment in Triton through its sale on May 29, 2019.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's credit arrangement dependency on Nicor Gas in 2022 relate to the financial charges and impairments associated with Nicor Gas in 2023, and what does this reveal about the strategic implications of their financial interdependence?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas had a committed credit arrangement expiring in 2026, under which Nicor Gas was the borrower of $700 million restricted for its working capital needs. This dependency on Nicor Gas for capital allocation within the credit arrangement highlights a strategic financial interdependence. In 2023, Nicor Gas was associated with significant financial charges, including a $96 million pre-tax disallowance of certain capital investments and a $131 million pre-tax impairment related to the sale of natural gas storage facilities. These financial impacts in 2023 demonstrate how Southern Company's earlier reliance on Nicor Gas through the credit arrangement directly exposed it to downstream financial risks, particularly when strategic assets were divested or capital investments were disallowed. The evolution from a structured credit dependency in 2022 to a year of material financial charges in 2023 underscores the strategic vulnerability embedded in their financial interdependence.",

To mitigate these effects, the company utilized mechanisms such as weather and revenue normalization and weather derivative instruments. In 2024, these mechanisms remained in place, with an explicit acknowledgment that customer consumption patterns were still largely weather-dependent, particularly during the heating season. However, the earnings impact appeared more stabilized, with no explicit mention of a similar decline, suggesting that the regulatory mechanisms helped reduce exposure to weather variability.",

The settlement agreement provides for (i) a $1 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues and a refund to customers of approximately $4 million, (ii) a rate escalation of 2.5% on an annual basis in periods subsequent to December 31, 2024 and continuing through the end of the SSA on December 31, 2035, and (iii) a waiver of rights by Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy to file for any changes in non-fuel rates through the end of the term of the SSA. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\n## Utility Regulation and Rate Design\n\nThe natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.\n\nAs a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed charges when billing their respective customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fix ed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta G as Light's revenues since the monthly fix ed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas has various mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit ex posure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.\n\nIn addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fix ed customer service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. With the exception of Chattanooga Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. See \"Rate Proceedings\" herein for additional information. Also see \"Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" herein for additional information regarding infrastructure replacement programs at certain of the natural gas distribution utilities.\n\nThe following table provides regulatory information for Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities:\n\n",

The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit.

      "question": "What explains Southern Company Gas' turnaround from a $29 million net income decrease in 2023 to a $109 million increase in 2024, particularly regarding weather-related consumption patterns?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas experienced a $29 million net income decrease, partly due to lower gas volumes sold, which were influenced by weather conditions affecting customer consumption patterns. The company had mechanisms like weather normalization and derivative instruments in place to mitigate these impacts, but they were not fully sufficient to offset the decline in earnings. In 2024, net income rebounded with a $109 million increase, driven by lower gas prices and reduced volumes sold compared to the prior year. This suggests that more favorable weather conditions in 2024 likely led to more stable or predictable consumption patterns, reducing the volatility in earnings. The evolution of the relationship between weather and consumption patterns indicates that the company's risk mitigation tools were more effective or that external conditions were more aligned with typical ranges, allowing for improved financial performance.",

These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fix ed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest ex pense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixedvariable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $109 million, or 24.7%, compared to 2023. Operating revenues decreased $206 million primarily due to lower gas cost recovery, partially offset by rate increases. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses decreased $390 million primarily due to a $412 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the $88 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher compensation and benefits expenses, and higher revenue taxes. The decrease in operating expenses also includes costs passed through directly to customers, primarily related to bad debt ex pense, energy efficiency programs, and revenue taxes. The decrease in net income also includes an increase of $46 million in income taxes primarily as a result of higher pre-tax  earnings and an increase of $36 million in interest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects - Nicor Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Pipeline Investments\n\nThe gas pipeline investments segment consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Marketing Services\n\nThe gas marketing services segment provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $11 million, or 12.1%, compared to 2023. The increase was due to a $43 million decrease in operating expenses primarily related to a decrease in cost of natural gas, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in operating revenues primarily due to lower retail margins.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan allocated 45% to equity investments and 10% to convertible securities, with registered investment companies being a key vehicle for diversification across global markets. By 2024, the equity allocation decreased to 43%, while alternative investments increased to 20% and convertible securities dropped to 5%. This reallocation reflects a strategic pivot toward alternative assets and away from convertible securities, which in turn influenced the relative importance and usage of registered investment companies as part of the overall investment structure. The continued use of registered investment companies in 2024 shows their ongoing role in diversification, though within a modified asset mix.",

See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner holding the same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 76,289 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed its financing activities in Note 8 of its 10-K filing, indicating its consolidated financing structure. By 2023, Nicor Gas had $1.7 billion in retained earnings restricted from being loaned or distributed to affiliates, which affected Southern Company Gas' internal capital flows. This restriction led to a more segmented financing approach, where Nicor Gas maintained its own commercial paper program without affiliate credit support, while Southern Company Gas Capital handled financing for other subsidiaries. The $96 million pre-tax disallowance charge related to Nicor Gas' capital investments in 2023 further highlighted the financial consequences of these financing constraints and regulatory limitations.",

The 2024 audit of Georgia Power reaffirmed the ongoing regulatory framework that assumes recovery of costs and return on investments, but noted that regulatory decisions could still impact the timing and amount of recovery. Despite this risk, the 2024 financial statements showed no material adverse regulatory decisions affecting Georgia Power's ability to recover its investments. This suggests that while the regulatory environment remains supportive in principle, the uncertainty around specific investment outcomes persists, requiring continuous evaluation of regulatory developments.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas held an 87.27% ownership stake in a facility jointly owned with NCEMC, indicating a strong but imbalanced partnership structure. By 2024, NCEMC expressed intent to co-own approximately 225 MW of the new Roxboro Plant CC Unit, signaling a shift toward more balanced risk-sharing. This evolution suggests that Duke Energy and NCEMC are recalibrating their partnership to distribute capital exposure more equitably for new generation projects, particularly as Duke Energy Progress plans to seek regulatory recovery of construction costs during the 2026\u20132029 build period.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's regulatory reporting obligations for Mississippi Power evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to the adoption of the reduced disclosure format for SEC filings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mississippi Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, explicitly stated that it would not file an annual report with the SEC after submitting its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021, indicating minimal ongoing reporting obligations. By 2024, Mississippi Power was among a group of Southern Company subsidiaries that adopted the reduced disclosure format under General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K, which applies to entities meeting specific conditions outlined in the SEC's filing guidelines. This shift reflects a formalized, streamlined reporting approach under a standardized regulatory exemption rather than discontinuation of filings altogether. The change suggests Southern Company restructured its subsidiaries' reporting strategies to align with SEC provisions that allow for reduced disclosures, impacting transparency and compliance efforts.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Mississippi Power Company: Southern Company's subsidiary Mississippi Power did not file an annual report with the SEC after its 2021 10-K and had no plans to do so.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nDuke E nergy recognizes revenue as custom ers obtain control of prom ised goods and services in an am ount that reflects consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, the delivery of electricity and natural gas results in the transfer of control to custom ers at the tim e the com m odity is delivered and the am ount of revenue recognized is equal to the am ount billed to each custom er, including estim ated volum es delivered when billings have not yet occurred. See N ote 19 for further inform ation.\n\n## Alternative R evenue Programs\n\nDuke E nergy accounts for certain types of program s established by the regulators in the states in which it operates, including decoupling m echanism s, as alternative revenue program s. Alternative revenue program s are contracts between an entity and its regulator, not a contract between an entity and a custom er. R evenue arising from  alternative revenue program s is presented as R egulated electric revenues and R egulated natural gas revenues on the C onsolidated Statem ents of O perations. R evenue from  alternative revenue program s is recognized in the period they are earned (i.e., during the period of revenue shortfall or excess due to fluctuations in custom er usage or when specific targets are m et resulting in the achievem ent of perform ance incentives or penalties) and a regulatory asset or liability on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets is established, which is subsequently billed or refunded to custom ers. D uke E nergy recognizes revenue as alternative revenue program s for program s that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determ inable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within 24 m onths. See N ote 19 for disaggregated revenue inform ation including revenue from  contracts with custom ers and revenues recognized as alternative revenue program s.\n\n## Derivatives and H edging\n\nDerivative and non-derivative instrum ents m ay be used in connection with com m odity price and interest rate activities, including swaps, futures, forwards and options. All derivative instrum ents, except those that qualify for the N P N S exception, are recorded on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Q ualifying derivative instrum ents m ay be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. O ther derivative instrum ents (undesignated contracts) either have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges. T he effective portion of the change in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in AO C I. T he effective portion of the change in the fair value of a fair value hedge is offset in net incom e by changes in the hedged item . F or activity subject to regulatory accounting, gains and losses on derivative contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities and not as other comprehensive incom e or current period incom e. As a result, changes in fair value of these derivatives have no im m ediate earnings im pact.\n\nForm al docum entation, including transaction type and risk m anagem ent strategy, is m aintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and at least every three m onths thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if it is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged item s.\n\nSee Note 15 for further inform ation.\n\n## Captive Insurance R eserves\n\nDuke E nergy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on an indem nity basis, to the Subsidiary R egistrants as well as certain third parties, on a lim ited basis, for financial losses, prim arily related to property, workers' com pensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for estim ated losses incurred but not reported (IBN R ), as well as estim ated provisions for known claim s. IBN R  reserve estim ates are prim arily based upon historical loss experience, industry data and other actuarial assum ptions. R eserve estim ates are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from  experience.\n\nDuke E nergy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization is deem ed probable.\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nPreferred stock is reviewed to determ ine the appropriate balance sheet classification and em bedded features, such as call options, are evaluated to determ ine if they should be bifurcated and accounted for separately. C osts directly related to the issuance of preferred stock are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received. T he liability for the dividend is recognized when declared. The accum ulated dividends on the cum ulative preferred stock is recognized to net incom e available to D uke E nergy C orporation in the E P S calculation. See Note 20 for further inform ation.",

      "question": "How did the change in NextEra Energy's fair value of forward contracts - power from 2022 to 2024 relate to the use of discounted cash flow as a valuation technique, and what does this imply about their exposure to power price volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NextEra Energy reported a fair value of $433 million in assets and $204 million in liabilities for forward contracts - power, using discounted cash flow as the valuation technique, with a weighted-average forward price of $37 per MWh. By 2024, the fair value had shifted to $423 million in assets and $401 million in liabilities, with an increased weighted-average forward price of $52 per MWh. This indicates a significant increase in exposure to power price volatility, as evidenced by the expanded range of forward prices from $(5) to $140 per MWh in 2022, to $(3) to $233 per MWh in 2024. The continued use of discounted cash flow suggests consistent valuation methodology, but the growing liabilities and wider price range imply heightened risk and potential for larger future obligations under these contracts.",

        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Discounted Cash Flow: NEE used discounted cash flow to value forward contracts - power at $433M assets and $204M liabilities with $37 weighted-average forward price",
        "Hop 2: Discounted Cash Flow \u2192 Forward Contracts - Power: Discounted cash flow was the valuation technique applied to forward contracts - power in both years",
        "Hop 3: Forward Contracts - Power \u2190 NEE(2024): In 2024, forward contracts - power showed increased liabilities ($401M) and wider forward price range ($(3) to $233 per MWh) using same valuation method"

      "answer": "In 2023, SO completed the Tranquillity Solar Storage project, a 72 MW battery energy storage facility in Fresno County, CA, marking its active expansion into energy storage solutions. This project, alongside the 88 MW Garland Solar Storage facility, demonstrated SO's commitment to diversifying its renewable portfolio. By the end of 2024, SO continued to operate both facilities, maintaining a combined 160 MW of battery energy storage capacity, indicating a sustained and stable strategic focus on energy storage as part of its broader renewable energy infrastructure. The continuation of these projects shows a deliberate effort to build long-term capabilities in managing and leveraging battery storage technologies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy already utilized VIEs like CRC to manage credit risk and absorb losses on accounts receivable. By 2024, the company expanded its use of VIEs by forming and consolidating entities such as DEPNC SF and DEPSC SF, which were created specifically to issue storm recovery bonds. DEPNC SF was formed in 2021 and issued bonds to finance storm costs from 2018\u20132019, while DEPSC SF was formed in 2024 and issued $177 million in bonds to recover costs from 2014\u20132022. These VIEs are bankruptcy-remote and secured only by storm recovery property and future customer charges, indicating a strategic shift toward securitizing long-term storm-related regulatory assets to stabilize cash flow and isolate financial risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## MD&amp;A\n\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Derivatives and Hedging,' for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\n\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment as a result of the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the company has resumed standard payment arrangement options . The Duke Energy Registrants are still monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties' abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants have observed a significant increase in utility account arrears as of December 31, 2021. There is an expectation of an increase in charge-offs in the future and the Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Revenue,\" respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Variable Interest Entities.'\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.\n\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate selfinsured retention. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Guarantees and Indemnifications,' for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty.",

      "question": "How did Nicor Gas's significant increase in short-term bank debt from $0 in 2021 to $300 million in 2022 relate to Southern Company's broader capital structure changes observed in 2023 when Nicor Gas's short-term bank debt was completely retired while Southern Company's overall short-term bank debt increased by 160%?",
      "answer": "In 2021 (SO 2022 filing), Nicor Gas had no short-term bank debt, but by 2022 this had increased to $300 million at 0.7% interest. However, by 2023 (SO 2023 filing), Nicor Gas had completely retired its short-term bank debt position while Southern Company's overall short-term bank debt increased from $1,800 million to $2,314 million with a corresponding increase in weighted average interest rate from 5.0% to 6.4%. This indicates a shift in financing strategy where Nicor Gas reduced its reliance on short-term bank debt while other parts of the Southern Company system increased such borrowings, potentially reflecting a reallocation of financing responsibilities within the corporate structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Nicor Gas: In 2022, Nicor Gas had $300 million in short-term bank debt at 0.7% interest, representing a significant change from 2021 when it had no such debt.",
        "Hop 2: Nicor Gas \u2192 Short-term Bank Debt: Nicor Gas disclosed specific short-term bank debt amounts in its 2022 financial statements, showing a new $300 million borrowing at 0.7% interest that wasn't present in the prior year.",
        "Hop 3: Short-term Bank Debt \u2190 SO(2023): By 2023, Nicor Gas had completely eliminated its short-term bank debt position while Southern Company's overall short-term bank debt increased from $1,800 million to $2,314 million with higher interest rates."

          "chunk_text": "\n(*) Daily physical sales for 2021 reflect amounts through the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021.\n\n## Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses\n\nIn 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $106 million, or 11.0%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

      "question": "How did the continuation of coordinated planning agreements with PowerSouth between 2022 and 2023 affect SCS's transmission service strategy for municipally-owned systems in Southern Company's territory?",
      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Southern Company maintained 72 municipally-owned electric distribution systems within its service territory, with no change in that number. However, SCS continued to refine its transmission service strategy through long-term agreements, such as the coordinated planning and operations agreement initiated in 2021 with PowerSouth, which became operational in 2022 and remained in effect through 2023. This agreement included joint commitment and dispatch, real-time energy transactions, and projected cost savings and reliability improvements. In 2023, SCS also extended its transmission service agreement with Cooperative Energy through March 2031, indicating a strategic emphasis on stable, long-term transmission partnerships with municipal and cooperative entities. These coordinated planning efforts allowed SCS to better integrate energy flows, reduce administrative overhead, and enhance grid reliability, directly supporting its role in delivering transmission services to the 72 municipally-owned systems.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 SCS: Southern Company's 2022 report details SCS's role in providing transmission services and operational coordination to PowerSouth under a 10-year agreement initiated in 2021.",
        "Hop 2: SCS \u2192 Municipalities: SCS delivers transmission services to municipally-owned systems through agreements and coordinated planning arrangements, including those with PowerSouth and Cooperative Energy.",
        "Hop 3: Municipalities \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, the number of municipally-owned systems remained unchanged at 72, and SCS continued to support them under the same coordinated planning framework, indicating strategic continuity."

In 2019, Alabama Power agreed to provide PowerSouth an additional 100 MWs of year-round capacity service from November 1, 2020 through February 28, 2023, with the option to extend through May 31, 2023. Additionally, in accordance with an agreement executed in August 2021, Alabama Power will provide approximately 100 MWs of year-round capacity service to PowerSouth beginning February 1, 2024.\n\nOn September 1, 2021, Alabama Power and PowerSouth began operations under a coordinated planning and operations agreement, with a minimum term of 10 years. The agreement includes combined operations (including joint commitment and dispatch) and real-time energy sales and purchases and is expected to create energy cost savings and enhanced system reliability for both parties. Projected revenues are expected to offset any increased administrative costs incurred by Alabama Power. Under the agreement, Alabama Power has the right to participate in a portion of PowerSouth's future incremental load growth.\n\nAlabama Power also has a separate agreement with PowerSouth involving interconnection between their systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from PowerSouth to certain distributing cooperatives in the service territory of Alabama Power is governed by the Southern Company/PowerSouth Network Transmission Service Agreement. The rates for this service to PowerSouth are on file with the FERC.\n\nOPC is an EMC owned by its 38 retail electric distribution cooperatives, which provide retail electric service to customers in Georgia. OPC provides wholesale electric power to its members through its generation assets, some of which are jointly owned with Georgia Power, and power purchased from other suppliers. OPC and the 38 retail electric distribution cooperatives are members of Georgia Transmission Corporation, an EMC (GTC), which provides transmission services to its members and third parties. See PROPERTIES - \"Electric - Jointly-Owned Facilities\" in Item 2 herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Georgia Power's jointly-owned facilities.\n\nMississippi Power has an interchange agreement with Cooperative Energy, a generating and transmitting cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided. Cooperative Energy also has a 10-year network integration transmission service agreement with SCS for transmission service to certain delivery points on Mississippi Power's transmission system through March 31, 2031. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff\" in Item 8 herein for information on an additional agreement between Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 72 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in which the traditional electric operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, 48 municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system received their requirements through MEAG Power. MEAG Power serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and purchases from other resources. MEAG Power also has a pseudo scheduling and services agreement with Georgia Power. Dalton serves its requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases from Southern Power through a service agreement. See PROPERTIES \"Electric - Jointly-Owned Facilities\" in Item 2 herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nGeorgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with GTC, MEAG Power, and Dalton providing for the establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of all parties. The agreements require an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in proportion to its respective share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES - \"Electric - Jointly-Owned Facilities\" in Item 2 herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with Georgia Power, investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other loadserving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. See \"The Southern Company System - Southern Power\" herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\" in Item 7 herein for additional information.\n\nSCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies, also has a contract with SEPA providing for the use of the traditional electric operating companies' facilities at government expense to deliver to certain cooperatives and municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in the purchase of power from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power allocated to them by SEPA from certain U.S. government hydroelectric projects.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company held a $30 million stake in SEGCO, with the full amount unused and due within one year. By 2024, SEGCO was subject to cross-acceleration provisions within Southern Company's broader credit arrangements, which meant that a default by SEGCO could trigger a default across its indebtedness. Despite this interconnected risk, as of December 31, 2024, SEGCO was in compliance with all covenants, including debt limits set at 65% of total capitalization. Additionally, a portion of the unused credit was allocated to support SEGCO\u2019s commercial paper programs, indicating that Southern Company's earlier stake in SEGCO had evolved into a more complex financial and regulatory relationship involving liquidity risk and covenant compliance.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NEE, through its subsidiary FPL Group Capital Inc, maintained multiple Replacement Capital Covenants tied to junior subordinated debentures issued as far back as 2006 (e.g., Series B due 2066 and Series C due 2067), with amendments dated November 9, 2016, reflecting a long-standing commitment to structured capital arrangements. In 2024, NEE continued to comply with these covenants, as evidenced by the presence of the same Replacement Capital Covenants in the filings, including the 2006 Series B and 2007 Series C instruments. This continuity implies that NEE has preserved a consistent capital structure strategy anchored in long-dated, covenant-backed debt instruments, potentially to ensure capital flexibility and regulatory compliance over extended horizons. The persistence of these covenants across years suggests a deliberate approach to capital management rather than a reactive stance.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's $30 million stake in SEGCO in 2022, which was fully consolidated, included SEGCO's ownership of electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs. These units were part of Southern Company\u2019s consolidated asset base in 2022, contributing to the $760 million reported value of electric generating units. By 2023, the consolidated value of electric generating units decreased to $670 million, a $90 million drop. This decline may reflect either asset impairments, revaluation adjustments, or changes in the operating profile of the generating units\u2014including those owned through SEGCO\u2014impacting the consolidated balance sheet. Given that Southern Company consolidates SEGCO, the reduction in asset value is directly tied to how the SEGCO units were valued and reported in the consolidated financial statements in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nFor entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $75 million in 2021, $67 million in 2020, and $93 million in 2019 for Alabama Power and $77 million in 2021, $69 million in 2020, and $95 million in 2019 for Georgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $14 million in 2021, $12 million in 2020, and $14 million in 2019, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nIn 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% limited partnership interest in SP Solar to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic). A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest in SP Solar and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns the remaining 66% ownership in SP Solar. SP Solar qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited partnership and the 33% limited partner does not have substantive kick-out rights against the general partner.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, SP Solar had total assets of $6.1 billion, total liabilities of $408 million and $387 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33% to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.\n\nIn 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind to three financial investors. Southern Power owns 100% of the Class B membership interests and the three financial investors own 100% of the Class A membership interests. SP Wind qualifies as a VIE since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not have substantive kick-out rights against Southern Power.",

These PPAs did not include capacity charges, meaning Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs depended on the level of energy generated, which was subject to weather, equipment performance, and transmission constraints. By 2024, Southern Power continued to rely on long-term PPAs for wind facilities, but the structure remained similar\u2014without capacity charges\u2014leaving them exposed to generation variability. However, Southern Power had approximately $384 million in unutilized federal PTCs tied to wind and solar energy production, which are recognized as income tax benefits based on kWh production, further linking financial performance to generation output. This shows a continuation of risk exposure tied to generation levels, with no structural change in the PPA terms, but increased emphasis on tax incentives tied directly to production.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 PPAs: Southern Power had PPAs related to wind facilities with remaining terms of up to 25 years, accounted for as operating leases, with no capacity charges, making cost recovery dependent on energy production.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company faced the FIP for Alabama, which required reductions in NOx emissions and led Alabama Power to submit notices of planned participation (NOPP) indicating plans to retire or convert several coal-fired units, including Plant Barry Unit 5 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4. These plans were tied to compliance with environmental regulations and led to the creation of a regulatory asset to recover unrecovered investment costs, totaling approximately $1.2 billion at the end of 2023. By 2024, Alabama Power was still subject to the FIP, which remained under legal review and abeyance, but had already begun implementing changes, such as converting Plant Barry Unit 4 to natural gas. The net book value of remaining assets tied to planned retirements decreased to $944 million by December 31, 2024, reflecting progress on these environmental compliance strategies. This shows that Southern Company's response to the FIP in 2023 directly shaped its operational footprint in Alabama in 2024 through strategic asset retirements and fuel transitions, with measurable financial implications recorded in its regulatory assets.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nOklahoma's and Utah's interstate transport SIPs to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit placed the Alabama SIP disapproval case in abeyance pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the venue issue.\n\nIn June 2023, the EPA published the 2015 Ozone NAAQS Good Neighbor federal implementation plan (FIP), which requires reductions in NO  emissions from sources in 23 states, including Alabama and Mississippi, to assure those states satisfy their Clean Air Act good neighbor obligations for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. Georgia and North Carolina have approved interstate transport SIPs addressing the 2015 Ozone NAAQS and are not subject to this rule. In June 2023, the State of Mississippi and Mississippi Power challenged the FIP for Mississippi in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In August 2023, the State of Alabama, Alabama Power, and PowerSouth Energy Cooperative challenged the FIP for Alabama in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Both cases are being held in abeyance pending resolution of the Mississippi SIP disapproval and Alabama SIP disapproval cases, respectively. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the FIP pending the disposition of petitions for review of the FIP in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and any petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's motion for partial voluntary remand of the FIP to address the administrative record deficiencies preliminarily identified by the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 10, 2024, the EPA published its supplemental response to comments on the FIP which addresses the administrative record deficiencies. On February 6, 2025, the EPA filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit requesting a 60-day abeyance of the FIP challenges so that the new Trump Administration can determine how to proceed with the litigation. X\n\nIn July and September 2023, the EPA published an Interim Final Rule and an updated Interim Final Rule that stays the implementation of the FIPs for states with judicially stayed SIP disapprovals, including Mississippi and Alabama, respectively. The Interim Final Rule revises the existing regulations to maintain currently applicable trading programs for those states.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the rule and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, implementation of the stayed FIPs may result in increased compliance costs.\n\n## Water Quality\n\nIn 2020, the EPA published the final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule (2020 ELG Rule), a reconsideration of the 2015 ELG rule's limits on bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater that extended the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The 2020 ELG Rule also updated the voluntary incentive program (VIP) and provided new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final rule revising the Steam Effluent Guidelines (2024 ELG Rule), which establishes more stringent limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion residual leachate to be met no later than December 31, 2029. The 2024 ELG Rule maintains the existing rule's permanent cessation of coal subcategory and the existing rule's VIP and adds a new cessation subcategory which allows units to cease coal combustion by December 31, 2034 as opposed to meeting the new more stringent requirements. The 2024 ELG Rule also establishes limitations for legacy wastewater which became effective on July 8, 2024. Numerous groups and states filed petitions for review challenging the rule in multiple federal circuit courts, and, on June 14, 2024, the challenges were consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 26, 2024, industry and state petitioners filed a motion to stay the rule pending judicial review, which was denied on October 10, 2024. The ultimate impact of the 2024 ELG Rule and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.\n\nAs required by the 2020 ELG Rule, in 2021, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each submitted initial notices of planned participation (NOPP) for applicable units seeking to qualify for these cessation of coal combustion or VIP subcategories that require compliance by December 31, 2028.\n\nAlabama Power submitted its NOPP to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) indicating plans to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 (700 MWs) and to cease using coal and begin operating solely on natural gas at Plant Barry Unit 4 (350 MWs) and Plant Gaston Unit 5 (880 MWs). Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO, indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (1,000 MWs). However, Alabama Power, in conjunction with Georgia Power, is evaluating extending the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the indicated retirement date. The NOPP submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. Plant Barry Unit 4 ceased using coal and began to operate solely on natural gas in December 2022. See Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" and \"SEGCO,\" respectively, for additional information.\n\nThe remaining assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural gas, have net book values totaling approximately $944 million (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2024. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs, associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order).

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company expressed concern over microgrids as a disruptive distributed energy resource that could erode market share and reduce the value of existing assets, particularly due to changing customer preferences and technological advancements. By 2024, the company shifted strategy, leveraging PowerSecure \u2014 a subsidiary that deploys microgrids \u2014 to actively engage in this space. This shift is evidenced by a $120 million increase in PowerSecure\u2019s operating revenues tied to distributed infrastructure projects and a corresponding $82 million increase in cost of sales, indicating a strategic pivot toward embracing microgrid deployment as part of their business model evolution.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO's filing included specific executive compensation data showing Georgia Power Company's total intrinsic value for outstanding and exercisable options at $17 million. In 2023, Georgia Power continued to qualify for the reduced disclosure format under General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K, which limits detailed reporting requirements. This continuation meant that detailed comparative analysis of executive compensation between 2022 and 2023 became more challenging, as the reduced format restricts the depth of compensation disclosures, despite the company meeting the same eligibility conditions. The 2023 filing maintained the reduced disclosure approach, but without explicit reference to Georgia Power's stock option valuations as seen in 2022, affecting year-over-year transparency.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas (via DECNC SF) had already established a storm recovery financing mechanism for North Carolina storm costs from 2018-2019 through the acquisition of storm recovery property backed by $237 million in bonds. By 2024, the company expanded this model to South Carolina with the formation of DECSC SF and the issuance of $177 million in new bonds to recover storm costs from 2014-2022. This indicates a strategic extension of their storm cost recovery framework from North Carolina to South Carolina, leveraging the same legal and financial structure involving special purpose subsidiaries and non-bypassable customer charges.",

(DECNCSF) and Duke Energy Progress NC Storm Funding, LLC. (DEPNCSF) are bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\n\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $237 million and $770 million of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The storm recovery property was created by state legislation and NCUC financing orders for the purpose of financing storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019.

The 2022 loss demonstrated active use of derivatives, particularly by Southern Power, and the persistence of netting across product lines in 2023 indicates that the company did not materially alter its risk management framework in response to that loss. Instead, Southern maintained its approach of netting derivative positions under master agreements, which allows for clearer balance sheet presentation and better risk control across energy, interest rate, and foreign currency derivatives.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Power's PPAs for wind facilities included capacity charges designed to recover fixed and variable operational costs, with a weighted-average remaining contract term of approximately 15 years tied to production tax credits (PTCs). By 2024, the structure shifted to energy-only PPAs that eliminated capacity charges, making Southern Power's recovery of fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses dependent on energy generation levels. This structural change, combined with the time-bound nature of PTCs (first 10 years of production), created a direct link between generation performance and tax credit utilization. With $765 million in unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs projected to be fully used by 2028, the shift in PPA structure likely increased Southern Power's exposure to generation volatility, potentially affecting the pace and certainty of PTC utilization over the next four years.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "question": "How did the change in fair value of NEE's forward contracts - power from 2023 to 2024 reflect the application of the discounted cash flow valuation technique, particularly in relation to the weighted-average forward price per MWh?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NEE reported the fair value of forward contracts - power at $500 million in assets and $470 million in liabilities using the discounted cash flow valuation technique, with a weighted-average forward price of $49 per MWh. By 2024, the fair value decreased to $423 million in assets and $401 million in liabilities, while the weighted-average forward price per MWh increased slightly to $52. This indicates that despite a drop in overall fair value, the pricing assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflected a modest increase in expected future power prices, suggesting a recalibration of market expectations or risk factors embedded in the valuation.",

These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\n\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $237 million and $770 million of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The storm recovery property was created by state legislation and NCUC financing orders for the purpose of financing storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. The storm recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from all Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The storm recovery bonds are secured by the storm recovery property and cash collections from the storm recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress. For additional information, see Notes 3 and 6.\n\nDECNCSF and DEPNCSF are considered VIEs primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIEs as described above and therefore Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DECNCSF and DEPNCSF, respectively.\n\nThe following table summarizes the impact of these VIEs on Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n",

O n Septem ber 8, 2023, Duke E nergy P rogress filed a com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent with all parties on all cost recovery issues raised in the storm  securitization proceeding.\n\nThe evidentiary hearing occurred in Septem ber 2023. O n Septem ber 20, 2023, the P SC SC  approved the com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent and on O ctober 13, 2023, the P SC SC issued its financing order. T he storm  recovery bonds of $177 m illion were issued by D uke E nergy P rogress in April 2024 and storm  recovery charges were effective M ay 1, 2024.

O n January 12, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress and the OR S, as well as other consum er, environm ental, and industrial intervening parties, filed a com prehensive Agreem ent and Stipulation of Settlem ent resolving all issues in the base rate proceeding. The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under \"Southern Company Gas\" and \"Southern Company Leveraged Lease,\" respectively, and Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" for information regarding impairment charges recorded during the periods presented.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities\n\nSouthern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas each evaluated its goodwill in the fourth quarter 2021 and determined no impairment was required. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" for information regarding impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in 2019.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, goodwill was as follows:\n\n",

The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that its regulated utility subsidiaries, including Georgia Power, faced a risk of non-recovery of costs due to regulatory uncertainty, particularly around the recovery of asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and remaining net book values of retired assets. Management's accounting judgments were based on assumptions about future regulatory decisions, and the company highlighted the potential for disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed or under-construction plants. By 2024, Georgia Power Company's financial statements continued to reflect this risk, with regulatory asset and liability balances still subject to Commission decisions, indicating that while the core risk remained, the specific regulatory asset balances and recovery expectations had evolved over time. The persistence of this risk across both years shows that Southern Company's exposure through Georgia Power remained significant, though the underlying asset composition and regulatory timelines had shifted.",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nSouthern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities (the \"regulated utility subsidiaries\"), which represent approximately 88% of Southern Company's consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 86% of its consolidated total assets at December 31, 2021, are subject to rate regulation by their respective state Public Service Commissions or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that the regulated utility subsidiaries meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the regulated utility subsidiaries, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company incurred a $72 million after-tax charge due to regulatory disallowances at Nicor Gas, reflecting the financial impact of capital investment decisions not being recoverable. By 2024, regulatory disallowances remained a material factor, as evidenced by their explicit inclusion in property, plant, and equipment valuations, indicating that the company continued to account for such risks in asset valuation. This shows a temporal evolution where regulatory disallowances transitioned from a realized financial loss in 2023 to a structural consideration in asset accounting by 2024.",

T he storm  recovery property was created by state legislation and a P SC SC  financing order for the purpose of financing storm  costs incurred from  2014 through 2022.\n\nThe storm  recovery property acquired includes the right to im pose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from  all D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' N orth Carolina and South C arolina retail custom ers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. T he storm  recovery bonds are secured by the storm  recovery property and cash collections from  the storm  recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. T he bondholders have no recourse to D uke E nergy Carolinas or D uke E nergy P rogress. T hese entities are considered VIE s prim arily because their equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations. D uke E nergy C arolinas and Duke E nergy P rogress have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE s as described above and therefore D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress are considered the prim ary beneficiaries. D uke E nergy C arolinas consolidates D E C N C SF  and D uke E nergy P rogress consolidates D E P N C SF  and D E P SC SF .\n\nThe following table sum m arizes the im pact of these VIE s on D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to weather risk evolve from 2023 to 2024 as its business mix shifted from traditional gas distribution to expanded solar and wind operations, particularly considering the $1.2 billion decrease in gas distribution revenues in 2023 and the weather-dependent energy output of renewable facilities in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas faced weather-related risk primarily through customer consumption patterns in its gas distribution operations, where lower-than-expected demand led to a $1.2 billion decrease in operating revenues. With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the company used weather normalization mechanisms to mitigate this exposure. By 2024, the company's weather risk profile expanded significantly through Southern Power\u2019s growing solar and wind operations, where energy output\u2014and thus revenue\u2014became directly dependent on weather conditions like sunlight and wind levels. This shift indicates a transition from weather affecting demand in gas distribution to weather directly impacting supply and performance in renewable generation, creating a new dimension of operational and financial risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

This project, along with others, contributed to SO's broader wind energy production capabilities. By 2024, SO's reporting indicated that wind energy assets, like Glass Sands, were expected to have a useful life of up to 35 years, demonstrating a shift toward long-term reliance on wind as a core component of its energy generation mix. The introduction of Glass Sands in 2022 thus served as a foundational step in building a durable wind energy infrastructure with extended operational horizons.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company performed a quantitative assessment for PowerSecure, which revealed that its fair value was lower than its carrying amount, resulting in a $119 million goodwill impairment. In 2023, PowerSecure again underwent a quantitative assessment, but this time the fair value exceeded the carrying amount, indicating an improvement in its financial outlook. This evolution suggests that Southern Company's approach remained consistent in conducting quantitative assessments when necessary, but the change in outcome reflects a recovery in PowerSecure's performance or market conditions. The absence of an impairment in 2023 had a positive financial impact, avoiding further write-downs and signaling improved asset valuation.",

The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur, including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.\n\nAs part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value.\n\nGoodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. For its 2021 annual impairment test, Southern Company Gas performed the quantitative assessment and confirmed that the",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas leased its 50% undivided ownership in the Dalton Pipeline for approximately $26 million annually through 2042, indicating a stable long-term commitment to the asset. This leasing arrangement remained consistent in 2024, as the same $26 million annual payment and 2042 end date were reaffirmed. The continuity in financial commitment and partnership with The Williams Companies, Inc., despite broader market fluctuations in natural gas demand, suggests that Southern Company views the Dalton Pipeline as a strategic asset for serving transportation customers under FERC-regulated tariffs and securing regional energy supply chains.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power had a first priority lien on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as part of its DOE loan guarantee obligations, which encumbered a significant portion of its assets. By 2023, this lien structure extended to substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties, indicating a tightening of financial constraints across the Southern Company system. In 2023, Nicor Gas faced $96 million in pre-tax charges due to disallowed capital investments and $131 million in asset impairment charges tied to the sale of natural gas storage facilities. These financial impacts suggest that the encumbrances from the first priority lien, which originated with Georgia Power in 2022, may have limited Nicor Gas' flexibility in capital deployment and asset management in 2023, leading to disallowed investments and asset impairments.",

See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner holding the same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 76,289 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company operated in Illinois through its subsidiary Nicor Gas, which served 2,276,000 customers as of 2023. However, in 2023, Nicor Gas faced a $96 million pre-tax charge due to the regulatory disallowance of certain capital investments, directly impacting the financial performance of Southern Company's Illinois operations. This charge indicates a decline in capital efficiency compared to 2022, as investments previously made were not fully recognized for financial or regulatory accounting purposes. The disallowance suggests increased regulatory scrutiny or changes in capital approval processes, which could affect future investment decisions and returns on Illinois operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company had $1.2 billion in unutilized federal ITCs tied to investments in solar facilities, which were expected to be fully utilized by 2024. These investments were directly linked to PPAs, as Southern Power and Georgia Power used these agreements to monetize the energy produced from those facilities. By 2024, the company\u2019s unregulated distributed generation business reported a drop in contract assets from $91 million in 2023 to $67 million in 2024, indicating a reduction in the value of outstanding performance obligations tied to PPAs. This decline suggests that the earlier ITC-supported solar investments may have led to a maturation or fulfillment of certain PPA obligations, reducing the forward-looking contract asset value.

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy was subject to FERC regulations through its operational structure, including its regulated subsidiaries. In 2023, the subsidiary KO Transmission, which was wholly owned by Duke Energy Ohio and directly subject to FERC regulations, sold all of its pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC on February 1, 2023, for approximately book value. This divestiture significantly reduced Duke Energy's direct regulatory exposure to FERC in the natural gas transportation segment, as KO Transmission no longer operates these facilities. The change reflects a strategic shift in Duke Energy's asset portfolio and regulatory risk profile related to FERC oversight.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy Progress' consolidation of DEPNC SF in 2024 reflect changes in the structure and scale of storm recovery financing compared to the 2021 bond issuance?",
      "answer": "In 2021, DEPNC SF issued $770 million in senior secured bonds to finance unrecovered storm costs from 2018 and 2019, with collections from North Carolina retail customers as the sole repayment source. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress not only continued to consolidate DEPNC SF but also expanded its storm recovery financing framework by forming and consolidating a new entity, DEPSC SF, which issued an additional $177 million in bonds to cover storm costs dating back to 2014. This reflects both a continuation of the original financing structure and an expansion in both geographic scope (now including South Carolina) and time horizon of recoverable costs, indicating a strategic evolution in how Duke Energy Progress manages long-term storm-related regulatory asset recovery.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NextEra Energy, through its subsidiary FPL Group Capital Inc, maintained multiple Replacement Capital Covenants (RCCs) tied to long-term debt structures such as the Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 and Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067. These covenants, first established in 2006 and amended in 2016, ensured that proceeds from new debt would be used to replace maturing obligations rather than for general corporate purposes. By 2024, NextEra Energy continued to comply with these RCCs, as evidenced by the inclusion of identical covenant language in new debt issuances like the 5.30% Debentures due 2032 and 5.90% Debentures due 2055. Despite the passage of time and new capital raises, the company preserved the core intent and structure of the RCCs, signaling a consistent strategic approach to capital replacement and debt management.",

      "question": "How did the change in Nicor Gas' LIFO inventory valuation from 2022 to 2023 affect Southern Company's financial exposure, particularly in light of the $96 million pre-tax charge associated with Nicor Gas in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Nicor Gas' LIFO inventory balance was $166 million, with an estimated replacement cost of $470 million, indicating a significant gap between book value and current market value. By 2023, the LIFO inventory balance increased to $186 million, while the estimated replacement cost dropped sharply to $268 million. This narrowing of the LIFO-replacement cost gap suggests a change in gas pricing dynamics. Despite the LIFO method being designed to shield the company from income impact during inventory drawdowns, the $96 million pre-tax charge in 2023 related to Nicor Gas indicates that these inventory and valuation changes coincided with regulatory disallowances or impairments, negatively affecting Southern Company's financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 LIFO Basis: Nicor Gas carried its natural gas inventory on a LIFO basis with a balance of $166 million and replacement cost of $470 million in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: LIFO Basis \u2192 Nicor Gas: The LIFO valuation method directly governed Nicor Gas' inventory accounting, with decrements charged at either replacement cost or actual LIFO cost depending on restoration timing.",
        "Hop 3: Nicor Gas \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Nicor Gas' inventory balance rose to $186 million (replacement cost: $268 million), and its operations negatively impacted Southern Company through a $96 million pre-tax charge due to regulatory disallowances."

          "chunk_text": "\n(a) Includes $39 million applied in 2019 to Alabama Power's NDR from its remaining excess deferred income tax regulatory liability balance in accordance with an Alabama PSC order.\n\n(b) Mississippi Power's net accrual includes carrying costs, as well as amortization of related excess deferred income tax benefits.\n\nSee Note 2 under \"Alabama Power - Rate NDR,\" \"Georgia Power - Storm Damage Recovery,\" and \"Mississippi Power - System Restoration Rider\" for additional information regarding each company's storm damage reserve.\n\n## Materials and Supplies\n\nMaterials and supplies for the traditional electric operating companies generally includes the average cost of transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes propane gas inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies. Materials and supplies for Southern Power generally includes the average cost of generating plant materials.\n\nMaterials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.\n\n## Fuel Inventory\n\nFuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and emissions allowances. Fuel inventory for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil, natural gas, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost, as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric operating companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.\n\n## Natural Gas for Sale\n\nWith the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. In Georgia's deregulated, competitive environment, Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a monthly basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract, along with a corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets and related natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.\n\nNicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted for differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income. At December 31, 2021, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was $166 million. Based on the average cost of gas purchased in December 2021, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at December 31, 2021 was $470 million.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company had approximately $1.2 billion of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, with $0.8 billion held by Southern Power, primarily tied to solar and wind facilities. These tax credits were expected to be fully utilized by 2024, often through tax equity partnerships where a tax partner captures most of the federal tax benefits. This financing structure directly influenced the accounting and structure of PPAs, as Southern Power's PPAs for solar and wind facilities were accounted for as operating leases with terms up to 25 years. By 2023, lease income from PPAs for Southern Power was included in wholesale revenues, indicating that the earlier tax credit strategy enabled the company to finance and structure long-term PPAs more effectively, thereby supporting revenue generation through stable lease income tied to energy production.",

At December 31, 2021, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.2 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2024, but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"General\" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Income Taxes\" and Note 10 to the financial statements under \"Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities - Tax Credit Carryforwards\" and \"Effective Tax Rate\" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences.\n\n## General Litigation and Other Matters\n\nThe Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein). Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the",

For the traditional electric operating companies, these arrangements consist of outdoor lighting contracts accounted for as operating leases with initial terms of up to seven years, after which the contracts renew on a month-to-month basis at the customer's option. For Mississippi Power, these arrangements also include a tolling arrangement related to an electric generating unit accounted for as a sales-type lease with a remaining term of 17 years. For Southern Power, these arrangements consist of PPAs related to electric generating units, including solar and wind facilities, accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 25 years and PPAs related to battery energy storage facilities accounted for as sales-type leases with remaining terms of up to 19 years. Southern Company Gas is the lessor in operating leases related to gas pipelines with remaining terms of up to 21 years. For Southern Company, these arrangements also include PPAs related to fuel cells accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 12 years.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that Nicor Gas had $300 million in short-term bank debt at a very low interest rate of 0.7%, indicating a favorable borrowing environment and potentially a strategy to leverage low-cost debt for operations or infrastructure investments. By 2024, Nicor Gas's short-term bank debt had decreased to $172 million but at a significantly higher interest rate of 4.6%, suggesting a shift in financing strategy\u2014possibly to reduce exposure to variable-rate debt amid rising interest rates. This change reflects a broader evolution in Southern Company\u2019s capital structure and risk management approach, aligning with a more conservative stance in a higher-rate environment while still maintaining access to short-term financing.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan allocated 10% of its target asset allocation to convertible securities, aiming to balance risk and return while protecting the plan's funded status. By 2024, this allocation was reduced to 5%, with a corresponding increase in alternative investments from 13% to 20%. This shift indicates a strategic reallocation toward alternative investments, suggesting that NEE adjusted its approach to achieving high returns with prudent risk management, potentially reflecting a decreased emphasis on convertible securities as part of its diversification strategy.",

The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle.

Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.

However, in 2023, Southern Power identified changes in tax legislation as a potential impairment indicator for long-lived assets, specifically generation assets. The 2023 filing explicitly states that changes in tax legislation could lead to impairment charges if they affect future cash flows.

The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date.

By 2024, SO's 10-K filing indicated that wind assets were now being planned with a standardized useful life of up to 35 years, aligning with solar but contrasting with the earlier 20-year PPA structure seen in Skookumchuck. This suggests SO extended its planning horizon for wind investments, even though the Skookumchuck project itself was contracted under shorter-term agreements.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

The increases were primarily associated with growth across the NEER businesses and higher depletion related to natural gas and oil production.\n\n## Gains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets -net\n\nIn 2024, the change in gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net primarily reflect the September 2024 sales of ownership interests in connection with the pipeline joint v enture and the renewable assets joint venture. See Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/A ssets.\n\n## Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity M ethod Investees\n\nNEER recognized $267 million and $649 million of equity in losses of equity method investees in 2024 and 2023, respectively .

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas held an 87.27% ownership stake in a facility jointly owned with NCEMC, indicating a significant but not exclusive control in shared assets. By late 2024, Duke Energy Progress and NCEMC entered a new co-ownership arrangement for the Roxboro CC project, where Duke would own approximately 1,135 MW and NCEMC would own 225 MW of the 1,360 MW facility. This reflects a shift toward a more balanced partnership model in new infrastructure development, while maintaining Duke\u2019s dominant role. The evolution from a high-controlling stake in 2023 to a more balanced MW split in 2024 suggests a strategic alignment to leverage NCEMC\u2019s regional presence and financing capabilities for cleaner, hydrogen-capable generation projects.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (SO) had a decreasing investment in SNG, with the last reported value at $127 million, indicating a potential reduction in capital commitment to the pipeline operator. By 2024, SNG was developing a $3 billion pipeline project that was explicitly subject to FERC approval, with completion projected for 2029. Southern Company Gas holds a 50% stake in this project, making FERC's regulatory decisions critical to SO's long-term infrastructure strategy. In 2024, SO also faced broader regulatory scrutiny, including FERC approval requirements for Alabama Power\u2019s Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition, highlighting an increased dependency on regulatory timelines across both gas and power segments. This evolution shows that SO\u2019s earlier financial positioning in SNG may have been a precursor to larger, FERC-dependent infrastructure commitments that now significantly shape SO\u2019s strategic execution risk and capital planning.",

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power.\n\n## Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity\n\nOn October 24, 2024, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. for a total purchase price of approximately $622 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. owns and operates the Lindsay Hill Generating Station, an approximately 855-MW combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Alabama Power will assume an existing power sales agreement under which the full output of the generating facility remains committed to a third party through April 2027. Upon expiration of the power sales agreement, Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with the Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC, as well as the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Renewable Generation Certificate\n\nThrough the issuance of a Renewable Generation Certificate (RGC), Alabama Power is authorized by the Alabama PSC to procure renewable capacity and energy and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. Under the original RGC, Alabama was authorized to procure up to 500 MWs of renewable capacity and energy. In June 2023, the Alabama PSC issued an order approving modifications to Alabama Power's RGC. The modifications authorized Alabama Power to procure an additional 2,400 MWs of renewable capacity and energy by June 14, 2029 and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. The modifications also increased the size of allowable renewable projects from 80 MWs to 200 MWs and increased the annual approval limit from 160 MWs to 400 MWs. Through December 31, 2024, Alabama Power has procured solar capacity totaling approximately 498 MWs under the RGC.\n\n## Rate RSE\n\nThe Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an \"A\" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey.\n\nAlabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 53.9% and 52.3%, respectively.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's $17 million stake in Georgia Power Company in 2022 represented a significant financial interest in a utility that is heavily regulated and undergoing continuous regulatory audits. By 2024, Georgia Power remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company and was subject to ongoing rate regulation by both the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. These regulatory matters, detailed in Note 2 of Georgia Power's 2024 financial statements, highlight the potential risk that regulatory decisions could impact the recovery of costs and investments. As a result, Southern Company's stake in Georgia Power directly exposed it to these regulatory outcomes, which could affect financial performance and investment recovery decisions in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Florida petitioned for approval to invest in 10 new solar facilities totaling 750 MW of capacity, with an estimated cost of $1 billion over three years. These facilities were tied to a subscription-based model where participants paid fees and received bill credits based on generation, with credits recoverable through the fuel cost recovery clause. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress and Florida had entered into PPAs classified as both finance and operating leases, indicating a structured financial mechanism to manage these solar investments. Additionally, the 2024 disclosures show that certain PPAs included variable lease payments tied to asset usage, which were not included in the measurement of right-of-use (ROU) assets or lease liabilities, suggesting a strategic alignment of PPA terms with the evolving solar facility economics and regulatory recovery mechanisms.",

The FPSC also approved allowing Duke Energy Florida to use the tax savings resulting from the Tax Act to recover these storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge. Approved storm costs were fully recovered by year-end 2021. On November 22, 2019, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition for approval of actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael in the amount of $191 million plus interest. On May 19, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a supplemental true up reducing the actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael by approximately $3 million, resulting in a total request to recover $188 million actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs, plus interest. Approximately $80 million of these costs are included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.\n\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on December 19, 2019, to recover $169 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Dorian, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement and the FPSC approved the petition on February 24, 2020. The final actual amount of $145 million was filed on September 30, 2020. The 2021 Settlement resolved all matters regarding storm cost recovery relating to Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\n\n## Clean Energy Connection\n\nOn July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program. The program consists of 10 new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately 750 MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt-subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the 10 new solar generation facilities is approximately $1 billion over the next three years, and this investment will be included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees. The credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC's order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. LULAC's initial brief was filed on May 26, 2021, and Appellees' response briefs were filed on July 26, 2021. LULAC's reply brief was filed on September 24, 2021, and its request for oral argument was filed on September 28, 2021. The Supreme Court of Florida heard the oral argument on February 9, 2022. The FPSC approval order remains in effect pending the outcome of the appeal. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.",

T he storm  recovery property was created by state legislation and a P SC SC  financing order for the purpose of financing storm  costs incurred from  2014 through 2022.\n\nThe storm  recovery property acquired includes the right to im pose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from  all D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' N orth Carolina and South C arolina retail custom ers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. T he storm  recovery bonds are secured by the storm  recovery property and cash collections from  the storm  recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. T he bondholders have no recourse to D uke E nergy Carolinas or D uke E nergy P rogress. T hese entities are considered VIE s prim arily because their equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations. D uke E nergy C arolinas and Duke E nergy P rogress have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE s as described above and therefore D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress are considered the prim ary beneficiaries. D uke E nergy C arolinas consolidates D E C N C SF  and D uke E nergy P rogress consolidates D E P N C SF  and D E P SC SF .\n\nThe following table sum m arizes the im pact of these VIE s on D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n",

      "question": "How did SO's evolving stake in PowerSouth in 2023 influence its electricity hedging strategies in 2024, particularly with respect to physical delivery contracts and fuel cost recovery mechanisms?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SO maintained a stake in PowerSouth, which owned over 1,600 MWs of generation capacity, including an 8.16% undivided interest in Alabama Power's Plant Miller Units 1 and 2. This relationship was further solidified by a 2021 agreement under which Alabama Power began supplying 100 MWs of year-round capacity to PowerSouth starting February 1, 2024. By 2024, SO's traditional electric operating companies were actively using energy-related derivative contracts with physical delivery mechanisms to hedge fuel costs, with gains and losses tied to regulatory recovery mechanisms. The initial stake and operational coordination in 2023 likely shaped SO's 2024 hedging approach by aligning physical energy flows with risk management strategies to stabilize fuel cost recovery.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 PowerSouth: SO maintained a stake in PowerSouth, which had an 8.16% undivided interest in Plant Miller and a 100 MW capacity agreement with Alabama Power starting in 2024.",

When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its ex posure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did NEE's shift from an indirect stake in NEP-owned wind projects in 2022 to direct investments in wind generation facilities by 2024 impact its 2024 operating revenues, particularly in relation to the $494 million revenue contribution from new investments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a noncontrolling interest in NEP, which owned a portfolio of wind projects (among other clean energy assets), and NEE accounted for its share of NEP's earnings through equity method investees. By 2024, NEE had transitioned to directly investing in new wind generation facilities, which contributed $494 million in new investment revenues during the year. This shift indicates a strategic realignment toward direct ownership of wind assets, which likely provided NEE with more control and potentially greater revenue retention compared to the earlier equity method approach. The 2024 operating revenues specifically reflect this transition through the significant contribution from new wind investments.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020.

Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATION - \"Southern Company - Electricity Business - Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses\" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATION under \"Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses\" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2020 and 2021.\n\nSCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2022, SCS has contracted for 517 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 12 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their 2022 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications, emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plan\" and \"Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 13 years. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units. Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nChanges in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See \"Rate Matters - Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans\" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nAdvances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and lower prices for natural gas, which fluctuate over time. Demand increases in 2021 resulted in price increases and high volatility; however, absent unforeseen developments, forward prices are expected to decline over the next several years. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, from Sequent, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Despite the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, the Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas asset management agreements with Sequent remain in place and will expire on March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2025, respectively. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's investment in solar facilities in 2022 influence the structure and scale of its power purchase agreements (PPAs) in 2023, particularly in relation to the 750 MW solar program approved in early 2021?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Florida was actively investing in a 750 MW solar program involving 10 new solar facilities at an estimated cost of $1 billion over three years. This investment was directly tied to the Clean Energy Connection program approved by the FPSC in January 2021, which structured the cost recovery through base rates offset by subscription fees and fuel cost recovery clauses. By 2023, this investment had evolved into a broader engagement with PPAs, as Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida had entered into PPAs classified as finance and operating leases. These PPAs were part of the company's growing reliance on variable lease payments tied to asset usage, which were not included in the measurement of lease liabilities. The progression from a defined solar investment plan in 2022 to structured PPAs in 2023 shows Duke Energy's strategic shift toward leveraging long-term agreements to manage its renewable energy portfolio expansion.",

          "chunk_text": "## Storm Restoration Cost Recovery\n\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on April 30, 2019, to recover $223 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Michael, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement, and the FPSC approved the petition on June 11, 2019. The FPSC also approved allowing Duke Energy Florida to use the tax savings resulting from the Tax Act to recover these storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge. Approved storm costs were fully recovered by year-end 2021. On November 22, 2019, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition for approval of actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael in the amount of $191 million plus interest. On May 19, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a supplemental true up reducing the actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael by approximately $3 million, resulting in a total request to recover $188 million actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs, plus interest. Approximately $80 million of these costs are included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.\n\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on December 19, 2019, to recover $169 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Dorian, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement and the FPSC approved the petition on February 24, 2020. The final actual amount of $145 million was filed on September 30, 2020. The 2021 Settlement resolved all matters regarding storm cost recovery relating to Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\n\n## Clean Energy Connection\n\nOn July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program. The program consists of 10 new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately 750 MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt-subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the 10 new solar generation facilities is approximately $1 billion over the next three years, and this investment will be included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees. The credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC's order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. LULAC's initial brief was filed on May 26, 2021, and Appellees' response briefs were filed on July 26, 2021. LULAC's reply brief was filed on September 24, 2021, and its request for oral argument was filed on September 28, 2021. The Supreme Court of Florida heard the oral argument on February 9, 2022. The FPSC approval order remains in effect pending the outcome of the appeal. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO had a 100% ownership stake in the Glass Sands wind project, which had a nameplate capacity of 118 MW and was already operational with a 12-year power purchase agreement (PPA) in place. By 2024, SO maintained full ownership of Glass Sands and continued to consolidate it as a subsidiary, indicating sustained strategic commitment. However, the 2024 filing highlights that SO was also managing a broader portfolio through various partnership structures, including tax equity partnerships for other wind facilities like Reading and Skookumchuck. This suggests that while SO retained full control of Glass Sands, it was operating within a more complex and diversified wind energy portfolio structure in 2024 compared to 2022, reflecting a maturing and strategic long-term approach to wind energy investments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NEE disclosed that its pension plan aimed to achieve a high rate of return with prudent risk, targeting a 20% allocation to alternative investments, including limited partnerships. By 2024, NEE's subsidiaries had direct investments totaling $3,315 million in limited partnerships and similar structures, down from $3,913 million in 2023, reflecting a strategic shift in capital deployment.

The pension fund's investment strategy emphasizes traditional investments, broadly diversified across the global equity and fixed income markets, using a combination of different investment styles and vehicles. The pension fund's equity and fixed income holdings consist of both directly held securities as well as commingled investment arrangements such as common and collective trusts, pooled separate accounts, registered investment companies and limited partnerships. The pension fund's convertible security assets are principally direct holdings of convertible securities and include a convertible security oriented limited partnership. The pension",

A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these V IEs consisted primarily of property , plant and equipment and accounts payable.\n\nOther - A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $5,848 million ($4,506 million at FPL) and $4,962 million ($3,899 million at FPL), respectively , which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not inv olv ed in the initial design of these entities and do not hav e a controlling financial interest in these entities.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in X PLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered V IEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE's investment in these entities totaled approximately $3,315 million and $3,913 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . A t December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $175 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 - Commitments and - Contracts, respectively.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to three land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to 34 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $372 million and $387 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $396 million and $412 million. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases totaled approximately $826 million and $840 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $440 million and $444 million. NEE's lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.83% and 3.96%, respectively , for operating leases and 4.92% and 4.32%, respectively , for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 44 years and 44 years, respectively , for operating leases and 33 years and 32 years, respectively , for finance leases. A t December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $2.6 billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. A t December 31, 2024, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2026 to 2044 and NEE expects to receive approximately $3.9 billion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the  power  sales  agreements  with  no  one  year  being  material.  Operating  and  sales-type  lease-related  amounts  were  not  material  to  NEE's  consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n\n## 11. Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset  retirement  costs  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  method  the  regulator  allows  for  recovery  in  rates.

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company (SO) operated the Tranquillity Solar Storage facility with a 72 MW capacity in Fresno County, CA, as part of its battery energy storage initiatives. By 2024, SO maintained the same 72 MW capacity at Tranquillity, indicating continued reliance on the storage infrastructure to support solar generation. However, SO also began developing the Millers Branch solar project in Haskell County, TX, with Phase I alone offering 200 MW of capacity and a planned 20-year PPA. This suggests that while SO preserved its existing battery storage footprint, it significantly expanded its solar generation capabilities, likely to enhance grid stability and optimize the use of storage assets like Tranquillity. The strategic alignment between storage and solar generation appears to reflect a broader focus on integrating renewable sources with existing infrastructure.",

By 2023, NEP operated a portfolio that included 10,118 MW of contracted renewable energy assets, with battery storage being a key component. In the 2023 filing, NEE disclosed that its capital expenditure plans included specific allocations for battery storage and renewable fuels projects, with $4.4 billion in commitments tied to equipment and construction activities. This indicates that NEE\u2019s earlier investment in NEP provided a strategic vehicle to direct capital toward battery storage growth in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's (SO) involvement with Plant Gaston through SEGCO evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what strategic implications does the requested extension of Plant Gaston's operation through 2034 have for SO's long-term generation portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company consolidated SEGCO, which owned electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, and was evaluating the potential extension of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the expected retirement date of December 31, 2028. By 2024, Georgia Power (a subsidiary of SO) formally requested an extension of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 through at least December 31, 2034, as part of the 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) filing. This 6-year operational extension indicates a strategic shift toward maintaining coal-based generation capacity longer than previously planned, aligning with broader portfolio adjustments that also included investments in combustion turbines and battery storage. The evolution of SO\u2019s relationship with Plant Gaston through SEGCO reflects a recalibration of its long-term generation mix and asset lifecycle management.",

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "answer": "In 2024, PowerSecure's deployment of microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers was a core part of Southern Company's 'Other Business Activities' segment. This segment saw interest expense increase by $31 million (10.0%) compared to 2023, partly due to higher average borrowings and interest rates, indicating increased capital investment likely tied to microgrid expansion. In 2022, Southern Company reaffirmed the strategic value of PowerSecure through its inclusion in the company's goodwill and intangible assets evaluation, stemming from the 2016 acquisition. The absence of impairment charges in 2021 and the continued deployment of microgrids in 2024 suggest that the acquisition has maintained or enhanced its strategic value. This evolution indicates that PowerSecure's microgrid capabilities are contributing to Southern Company's broader diversification and resilience strategy, justifying the initial investment and ongoing capital allocation.",

See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under \"Southern Company Gas\" and \"Southern Company Leveraged Lease,\" respectively, and Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" for information regarding impairment charges recorded during the periods presented.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities\n\nSouthern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas each evaluated its goodwill in the fourth quarter 2021 and determined no impairment was required. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" for information regarding impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in 2019.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, goodwill was as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How did the structure and capacity of Nicor Gas' commercial paper program-backed credit arrangements change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about Southern Company Gas' evolving financial strategy for managing Nicor Gas' working capital needs?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Nicor Gas operated its own commercial paper program to support working capital needs and was restricted from making money pool loans to affiliates. Southern Company Gas Capital managed commercial paper programs for other subsidiaries, but Nicor Gas had separate financing without affiliate credit support. By 2024, Nicor Gas had a $700 million allocation under a multi-year $2.45 billion combined credit arrangement expiring in 2029, specifically restricted for its working capital needs, with the ability to adjust allocations between Nicor Gas and Southern Company Gas Capital. This indicates a strategic shift toward integrating Nicor Gas into a broader, more flexible credit framework while maintaining its financial independence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Commercial Paper Programs: Southern Company Gas maintained separate commercial paper programs for Nicor Gas and Southern Company Gas Capital, with Nicor restricted from affiliate loans.",
        "Hop 2: Commercial Paper Programs \u2192 Nicor Gas: Nicor Gas' commercial paper program was directly tied to its working capital financing and constrained by regulatory restrictions.",
        "Hop 3: SO(2024) \u2190 Nicor Gas: In 2024, Nicor Gas became a borrower under a $2.45 billion combined credit arrangement with a dedicated $700 million allocation for its working capital needs, showing increased integration and flexibility."

Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries.

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Power was utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind, solar, and battery storage projects, consolidating them under the HLBV methodology, with approximately $1.2 billion in unutilized ITCs and PTCs expected to be used by 2024. By 2024, the Inflation Reduction Act had expanded tax credit transferability, enabling Southern Company subsidiaries like Alabama Power and Georgia Power to enter into agreements to monetize ITCs and PTCs through third-party sales at a discount. This marked a shift from earlier reliance on internal utilization through tax equity partnerships, as the HLBV methodology continued to be used but now within a broader framework of active tax credit monetization. The evolution reflects a strategic adaptation to new regulatory opportunities under the IRA, allowing for more flexible and immediate cash flow generation from previously accumulated tax credits.",

The IRA extends, expands, and increases ITCs and PTCs for clean energy projects, allows PTCs for solar projects, adds ITCs for stand-alone energy storage projects with an option to elect out of the tax normalization requirement, and allows for the transferability of the tax  credits. The IRA extends and increases the tax credits for CCS projects and adds tax credits for clean hydrogen and nuclear projects. Additional ITC and PTC amounts are available if the projects meet domestic content requirements or are located in low-income or energy communities. The IRA also enacted a 15% CAMT on book income, with material adjustments for pension costs and tax depreciation. The 15% CAMT on book income can be reduced by tax credits.\n\nFor solar projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC and an option to claim a PTC instead of an ITC. Starting in 2023 and through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC for stand-alone energy storage projects. For wind projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 100% PTC, adjusted for inflation annually. For projects placed in service before 2022, the 2024 PTC rate is 2.9 cents per KWH. For projects placed in service in 2022 and later, the 2024 PTC rate is 3 cents per KWH. The same PTC rate applies for solar projects for which the PTC option has been elected. To realize the full value of ITCs and PTCs, the IRA requires satisfaction of prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.\n\nIn April 2024, the IRS issued final regulations related to the transfer of tax  credits. In 2024, Alabama Power, G eorgia Power, and Southern Power entered into purchase and sale agreements with non-affiliated parties to sell ITCs and PTCs at a discount to the generated credit value in 2024, 2025, and 2026. The discount will be recorded as a reduction in tax  credits recognized in the financial statements. The Southern Company system continues to explore the ability to efficiently monetize tax credits through third-party transferability agreements. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power have nuclear generating facilities that may qualify to generate and claim PTCs under the IRA beginning in 2024.\n\nOn September 12, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued a notice of proposed regulations that would address the application of the CAMT. Southern Company is evaluating the proposed regulations and is subject to the CAMT for the 2024 tax year, primarily driven by tax deductions for Georgia Power's storm restoration costs and the natural gas safe harbor tax accounting method change, based on interpretations of the early CAMT guidance. The CAMT will primarily be satisfied by tax  credits for the 2024 tax  year. The CAMT impacts operating cash flows of certain Registrants but will not impact the Registrants' net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Storm Damage Recovery\" for additional information on Georgia Power's storm restoration costs. Also see \"Natural Gas Safe Harbor Method\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nImplementation of the IRA provisions related to existing nuclear generating facilities and CAMT is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS. The Registrants are still evaluating the impacts, and the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Georgia State Tax Legislation\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the State of Georgia enacted tax legislation that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 5.75% to 5.39% effective for the 2024 tax  year. This legislation reduced the amount of Southern Company's and certain subsidiaries' income tax expense in the State of Georgia and existing state net accumulated deferred tax liabilities, increased regulatory liabilities at G eorgia Power and Southern Company Gas, and reduces Georgia Power's ability to utilize certain state tax credits in the State of G eorgia. The legislation did not have a material impact on the net income of the applicable Registrants.\n\n## Natural Gas Safe Harbor Method\n\nIn April 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor tax method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures to maintain, repair, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized or allowed as repair deductions. The revenue procedure allows multiple alternatives for implementation which will result in a tax  accounting method change for Southern Company Gas' eligible expenditures. On April 30, 2024, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2024-23, which gives additional implementation guidance on the natural gas safe harbor tax method of accounting for qualifying repair deductions. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas intend to submit a tax accounting method change for qualifying expenditures with the filing of the 2024 federal income tax  return. The new tax  method of accounting is ex pected to result in a material net positive cash flow for Southern Company Gas; however, the",

      "answer": "In 2021, Southern Company divested Sequent, which had previously provided wholesale gas services\u2014including asset management, logistics, storage, and pipeline arbitrage\u2014for its utilities, including Nicor Gas. Following this divestiture, Southern Company Gas restructured its operations and financial support mechanisms. By 2024, this led to a dedicated $2.45 billion credit arrangement under which $700 million was specifically allocated to Nicor Gas for its working capital needs, with flexible sublimits that could be adjusted between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. This reflects a strategic shift to provide direct financial support to Nicor Gas, which previously relied on Sequent\u2019s wholesale services for certain operational functions.",

Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.\n\nThe number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.\n\n## Seasonality of Results\n\nDuring the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services' operating revenues occasionally were impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.\n\n",

Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments also included wholesale gas services. The non-reportable segments are combined and presented as all other. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on the disposition activities described herein.\n\nGas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and includes natural gas local distribution utilities that construct, manage, and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and gas distribution facilities in four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. Gas pipeline investments also includes a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline project, which was cancelled in September 2021, and through its March 24, 2020 sale, included a 5% ownership interest in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline construction project. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information.\n\nThrough July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services provided natural gas asset management and/or related logistics services for each of Southern Company Gas' utilities except Nicor Gas as well as for non-affiliated companies. Additionally, wholesale gas services engaged in natural gas storage and gas pipeline arbitrage and related activities.\n\nGas marketing services provides natural gas marketing to end-use customers primarily in Georgia and Illinois through SouthStar.\n\nThe all other column includes segments and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including storage and fuels operations. The all other column included Jefferson Island through its sale on December 1, 2020, Pivotal LNG through its sale on March 24, 2020, and the investment in Triton through its sale on May 29, 2019.",

S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "NextEra Energy's stake in NEP, supported by convertible note arrangements in 2022, provided NEP with financial flexibility and capital infusion options, enabling it to grow its wind project portfolio. By 2023, NEP owned or had partial ownership in approximately 10,118 MW of contracted renewable energy assets, including wind projects. Specifically, NEE's 2023 filings disclosed capital expenditures for new wind projects and repowering of existing ones totaling approximately 2,621 MW. The convertible notes issued by NEP in 2021 and 2020, which NEE had exposure to through its stake, allowed NEP to secure liquidity for expansion and repowering initiatives, directly contributing to the growth in wind capacity disclosed in 2023.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the change in fair value of NEE's Full Requirements and Unit Contingent Contracts from 2023 to 2024 reflect shifts in forward pricing assumptions under the Discounted Cash Flow valuation technique?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NEE reported the fair value of Full Requirements and Unit Contingent Contracts at $674 million in assets and $146 million in liabilities, using a weighted-average forward price of $67 per MWh. By 2024, the fair value had decreased to $209 million in assets and $203 million in liabilities, with a corresponding increase in the weighted-average forward price assumption to $76 per MWh. This indicates that despite higher forward pricing assumptions, the overall valuation of these contracts declined significantly year-over-year, suggesting a contraction in expected future cash flows or a reduction in contract volume.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE(2023) \u2192 Discounted Cash Flow: NEE used discounted cash flow to value its Full Requirements and Unit Contingent Contracts at $674 million in assets and $146 million in liabilities, with a weighted-average forward price of $67 per MWh.",
        "Hop 2: Discounted Cash Flow \u2192 Full Requirements and Unit Contingent Contracts: The valuation technique applied to these contracts includes forward price per MWh as a key unobservable input, directly influencing the fair value measurement.",
        "Hop 3: Full Requirements and Unit Contingent Contracts \u2190 NEE(2024): In 2024, NEE disclosed a significantly lower fair value for these contracts\u2014$209 million in assets and $203 million in liabilities\u2014with a higher weighted-average forward price of $76 per MWh, indicating a shift in market expectations or contract composition."

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company was still evaluating the impacts of transitioning from LIBOR to an alternative rate under ASU 2020-04, with uncertainty about the ultimate outcome (chunk 1). ASU 2022-06 extended the applicability of ASU 2020-04\u2019s relief from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, enabling companies to continue using expedients during the transition (chunk 2). By mid-2023, Southern Company had fully transitioned all debt and hedging arrangements from LIBOR to SOFR, applying the practical expedients under both ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06, with no material financial impact (chunk 3).",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a noncontrolling interest in NEP, which owned a portfolio of clean energy projects including solar and solar plus battery storage projects, and NEE accounted for this stake as an equity method investment. By 2023, NEE disclosed capital expenditures totaling approximately 6,134 MW for new solar projects, including solar plus battery storage, indicating a significant increase in direct investment in solar infrastructure. This evolution suggests a strategic shift from relying on equity investments in NEP for solar exposure to more direct ownership and capital deployment in solar projects, reflecting a more aggressive stance on renewable energy development.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

These derivatives were specifically tied to fuel-hedging programs under regulatory guidelines, and gains/losses were initially recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities (SO_10k_2022.pdf:page_318:chunk_1). By 2024, the company continued to use regulatory hedges extensively for energy-related derivatives, with substantially all traditional electric and natural gas distribution utilities' contracts still designated under this method (SO_10k_2024.pdf:page_113:chunk_3). However, 2024 also introduced new context regarding $1.4 billion in long-term variable interest rate exposure at the parent level, which may have influenced the company's broader risk management strategy, even though energy-related regulatory hedges remained largely unchanged in structure and purpose.",

See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.\n\nEnergy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:\n\n- Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.\n- Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.\n- Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.\n\nSome energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory asset and liability disclosures related to Mississippi Power Company in 2022 evolve into the critical audit matter around rate regulation impact in 2023, particularly in terms of management's assumptions about cost recovery and refund risks?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mississippi Power Company, a subsidiary of Southern Company, disclosed that it accounted for the effects of rate regulation under GAAP, with significant impacts on financial statement line items such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; and operating revenues. Management assumed that the Mississippi Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would allow recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable return on investment. By 2023, Southern Company's audit report highlighted that the impact of rate regulation on certain assets and liabilities remained a critical audit matter, with management making increasingly subjective judgments about the likelihood of cost recovery, potential disallowances of plant costs, and refund obligations to customers. This shows a shift from general regulatory accounting assumptions in 2022 to more specific and risk-laden evaluations of cost recovery outcomes in 2023, particularly as audit procedures focused on testing the completeness and accuracy of regulatory asset/liability recordings and management's representations regarding future regulatory decisions.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Mississippi Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Mississippi Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nMississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets - asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Mississippi Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company was subject to dividend restrictions due to regulatory requirements that limited Nicor Gas from distributing more than $1.3 billion in retained earnings to affiliates. This constrained Southern Company\u2019s ability to draw capital from Nicor Gas during that year. In 2023, this regulatory constraint was compounded by a $96 million pre-tax charge related to disallowed capital investments at Nicor Gas, which directly impacted Southern Company\u2019s financial performance and likely limited reinvestment or dividend capacity from the subsidiary. The chain shows that the initial regulatory restriction on dividends (linked to Nicor Gas\u2019s retained earnings) in 2022 evolved into a financial penalty in 2023, reducing the value Nicor Gas could provide to Southern Company.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's ownership stake in MEAG Power in 2023 influence its electricity procurement risk exposure and subsequent derivative hedging strategies in 2024, particularly in relation to fuel cost variability?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's ownership stake in MEAG Power in 2023 positioned it within a broader electricity supply chain where MEAG Power served the requirements of 48 municipal systems and one county-owned system through self-owned generation (some jointly-owned with Georgia Power) and external purchases. This arrangement exposed Southern Company to shared fuel cost variability through MEAG Power's generation mix. In 2024, Southern Company explicitly acknowledged managing energy-related derivative contracts under three accounting methods\u2014regulatory hedges, cash flow hedges, and undesignated contracts\u2014to mitigate fuel cost risks. The need for these hedging strategies was directly tied to the company's integrated electricity procurement structure, including MEAG Power's role in supplying power to municipal systems, which required Southern Company to hedge against fuel price volatility across its system.",

When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its ex posure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company reported $2 million in expenditures for Chattanooga Gas' Pipeline Replacement Program, part of a seven-year, $118 million initiative to replace 73 miles of distribution main, with costs recovered through annual base rate reviews. By 2023, Southern Company's direct investment in Chattanooga Gas had risen to $7 million, indicating a significant increase in capital allocation to the program. This fivefold increase suggests both the program's ongoing execution and Southern Company's prioritization of infrastructure modernization in its gas utilities, especially as Chattanooga Gas' funding mechanism relies on regulatory-approved base rate recovery rather than riders, making sustained investment critical to meeting the program's multi-year scope.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAtlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC.\n\nSee \"Rate Proceedings - Atlanta Gas Light\" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 18, 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024.\n\n## Chattanooga Gas\n\nIn June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.\n\n## Natural Gas Cost Recovery\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, the over recovered balance was $88 million, which was included in other regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.\n\n## Rate Proceedings\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.\n\nIn July 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of $37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's 2024 disclosures reflect a strategic pivot in how PowerSecure's distributed energy solutions are positioned within the organization, following the $119 million goodwill impairment recorded in 2022. In 2023 filings, PowerSecure was noted as a subsidiary with a history of goodwill impairment due to declining macroeconomic conditions that reduced sales growth and cash flow estimates. By 2024, PowerSecure\u2019s role in developing 'distributed energy and resilience solutions' was elevated in the financial disclosures, specifically called out as part of the 'All Other' segment, which includes microgrid deployments for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. This shift in visibility suggests that despite the earlier impairment, Southern Company is emphasizing PowerSecure\u2019s strategic value in the distributed energy space as part of its broader portfolio diversification and resilience planning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 PowerSecure: Southern Company disclosed a $119 million goodwill impairment for PowerSecure in 2022, citing declining macroeconomic conditions and reduced cash flow projections.",
        "Hop 2: PowerSecure \u2192 Distributed Energy Solutions: PowerSecure is explicitly described as developing 'distributed energy and resilience solutions' and deploying microgrids for a range of customers.",
        "Hop 3: Distributed Energy Solutions \u2190 SO(2024): In the 2024 financial statements, Southern Company explicitly includes distributed energy solutions as a named component of its 'All Other' segment, indicating a strategic emphasis in reporting."

The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2022 risk disclosures around physical attacks on nuclear facilities influence its 2023 nuclear operations and investment decisions, particularly regarding Plant Vogtle Unit 4 construction and security expenditures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that physical attacks posed a material risk to its nuclear power plants, noting that such threats could result in increased licensing or compliance costs and that nuclear facilities were inherently vulnerable to security risks (SO_10k_2022.pdf:page_30). The filing specifically highlighted that Alabama Power and Georgia Power owned or co-owned six nuclear units generating 26-28% of their total KWHs in 2021, and that Southern Nuclear was managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (SO_10k_2022.pdf:page_29). By 2023, Southern Nuclear continued to operate the existing nuclear fleet and was actively managing the start-up of Plant Vogtle Unit 4 (SO_10k_2023.pdf:page_11), suggesting that despite the identified risks, the company remained committed to expanding its nuclear capacity. This indicates that the 2022 risk disclosures likely prompted increased investment in security measures and compliance protocols, particularly for the newly constructed units, though the filings do not quantify the exact increase in security expenditures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Physical Attacks: Southern Company explicitly identified physical attacks as a risk factor in 2022, noting that nuclear facilities were particularly vulnerable and that such risks could lead to increased compliance costs and operational disruptions.",
        "Hop 2: Physical Attacks \u2192 Nuclear Power Plants: The 2022 filing directly linked physical attack risks to nuclear power plants, noting that Southern Nuclear operated six nuclear units for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, which represented a significant portion of their electricity generation in 2021.",
        "Hop 3: Nuclear Power Plants \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Southern Nuclear was still operating the existing nuclear fleet and had advanced to managing the start-up of Plant Vogtle Unit 4, indicating continued investment in nuclear despite the previously identified security risks."

In addition, physical attacks against third-party providers could have a similar effect on the Southern Company system.\n\nDespite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical attacks. If assets were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner, the affected Subsidiary Registrant may be unable to fulfill critical business functions. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses.\n\n## An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of, or inability to remotely access, one or more key technology systems, networks, or processes could impact the ability of the Registrants to operate.\n\nThe Subsidiary Registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of interconnected systems. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure and the technology systems' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, denial of service, ransomware, acts of war or terrorism, or other types of data security breaches, the Southern Company system faces a heightened risk of cyberattack. Cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments, have attacked and threatened to attack energy infrastructure. Various regulators have increasingly stressed that these attacks, including ransomware attacks, and attacks targeting utility systems and other critical infrastructure, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency.\n\nThe Registrants and their third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the Southern Company system, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks. However, the Registrants cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.\n\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, Southern Company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information about customers, employees, and stockholders, and other confidential information. In some cases, administration of certain functions may be outsourced to third-party service providers. Malicious actors may target these providers to disrupt the services they provide to the Registrants, or to use those third parties to attack the Registrants. The Registrants' third-party service providers could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to their systems.\n\nInternal or external cyber attacks may inhibit the affected Registrant's ability to fulfill critical business functions, including energy delivery service failures, compromise sensitive and other data, violate privacy laws, and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Any cyber breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the affected Registrant to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses. Additionally, the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing system protection measures are significant, and they could materially increase to address ever changing intense, complex, and sophisticated cyber risks.\n\n## The Southern Company system may not be able to obtain adequate natural gas, fuel supplies, and other resources required to operate the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's electric generating plants or serve Southern Company Gas' natural gas customers.\n\nSCS, on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, purchases fuel for the Southern Company system's generation fleet from a diverse set of suppliers. Southern Company Gas' primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Natural gas is delivered daily from different regions of the country. This daily supply is complemented by natural gas supplies stored in both company-owned and third party storage locations. To deliver this daily supply and stored natural gas, the Southern Company system has firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate pipelines. Disruption in the supply and/or delivery of fuel as a result of matters such as transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting fuel suppliers could limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs, and the ability of Southern Company Gas to serve its natural gas customers.\n\nThe Southern Company system is dependent upon natural gas as a fuel source for its power generation needs, which not only has the potential to impact the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's costs of generation but the costs",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.

      "answer": "In 2022, nuclear power plants contributed approximately 26% and 28% of total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. By 2023, these figures increased to 27% and 29%, indicating a growing reliance on nuclear generation. The 2022 filing explicitly noted that nuclear facilities are subject to cyber intrusions, which could lead to increased licensing or compliance costs. In 2023, Southern Company reiterated these risks and specifically emphasized that threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs. The parallel evolution suggests that as Southern Company increased its dependence on nuclear power, it also faced heightened awareness and potential financial exposure related to cyber intrusion risks, directly influencing compliance and operational cost considerations.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy already used VIEs, such as CRC, to manage credit risk by selling accounts receivable and absorbing losses through subordinated retained interests. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress formed DEPSC SF, a new VIE specifically to issue $177 million in senior secured storm recovery bonds, consolidating it as part of its financial strategy. This reflects a strategic shift toward using VIEs not only for accounts receivable management but also for long-term financing of storm-related regulatory assets, indicating an expansion in the scope and purpose of VIE utilization over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## MD&amp;A\n\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Derivatives and Hedging,' for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\n\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment as a result of the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the company has resumed standard payment arrangement options . The Duke Energy Registrants are still monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties' abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants have observed a significant increase in utility account arrears as of December 31, 2021. There is an expectation of an increase in charge-offs in the future and the Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Revenue,\" respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Variable Interest Entities.'\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.\n\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate selfinsured retention. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Guarantees and Indemnifications,' for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Indiana's Cayuga facility had a coal/oil-fired capacity of 1,005 MW. By 2023, this capacity increased slightly to 1,015 MW. This indicates that Duke Energy maintained a strong reliance on coal-fired generation in Indiana through the Cayuga facility, despite broader industry trends toward renewable energy. The continued operation and slight expansion of Cayuga's coal/oil capacity suggest that Indiana remains a key region for Duke Energy's fossil fuel-based generation portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company expressed concerns that microgrids and distributed energy resources could negatively impact its traditional utility business model by changing asset construction patterns and cost recovery methods. By 2024, Southern Company's subsidiary PowerSecure saw a $120 million increase in revenues tied to distributed infrastructure projects, indicating a strategic pivot toward embracing microgrids. This shift suggests that rather than resisting the trend, Southern Company leveraged its ownership of PowerSecure to capitalize on the growing demand for microgrids, thereby transforming a perceived threat into a financial opportunity.",

          "chunk_text": "of purchased power as well. The robust growth in supply allowed natural gas prices to moderate and remain below $3 per mmBtu in recent years; however, demand increases in 2021 resulted in price increases and high volatility. Prices have averaged approximately $3.75 per mmBtu in 2021, and 2022 prices are expected to be in the same range. Forward prices are expected to decline over the next several years toward $3 per mmBtu. With the majority of natural gas production being from shale gas formations, any limitation on shale gas production would be expected to have a material impact on the supply availability as well as the cost of natural gas. In addition, new demand, in particular exports to Mexico and those from LNG facilities, has grown significantly and is having greater impact on the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's natural gas markets.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are also dependent on coal, and related coal supply contracts, for a portion of their electric generating capacity. The counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of financial or technical problems. In addition, the suppliers may be delayed in supplying or may not be required to supply coal under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain their contracted coal requirements, they may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, and these increased costs may not be recoverable through rates. The railroad industry is experiencing labor shortages, which could lead to delays in coal deliveries or increased costs. Additionally, the utility industry is also being impacted by coal delivery challenges associated with new railroad management systems which favor stable, predictable deliveries and a market trend of shifting railroad capacity away from coal deliveries to other industries.\n\nIn addition to fuel supply, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power also need adequate access to water, which is drawn from nearby sources, to aid in the production of electricity. Any impact to their water resources could also limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs.\n\nThe revenues of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on sales under PPAs, the success of which depend on PPA counterparties performing their obligations, Southern Company subsidiaries satisfying minimum requirements under the PPAs, and renewal or replacement of the PPAs for the related generating capacity.\n\nMost of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. Southern Power's top three customers, Southern California Edison, Georgia Power, and Tennessee Valley Authority accounted for 7.4%, 6.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, of Southern Power's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The traditional electric operating companies have entered into PPAs with non-affiliated parties.\n\nThe revenues related to PPAs are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations. Although the credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted or specified in the applicable contract.\n\nAdditionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If one of these Registrants is unable to replace expiring PPAs with an acceptable new revenue contract, it may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale prices and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks, or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. The failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these PPAs, including PPAs related to projects under construction, could result in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs.\n\n## Increased competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies and changes in customer demand for energy could negatively impact Southern Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies operate under a business model that invests capital to serve customers and recovers those investments and earns a return for investors through state regulation. Southern Power's business model is primarily focused on investing capital or building energy assets to serve creditworthy counterparties using a bilateral contract model. A key premise of these business models is that generating power at power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost.\n\nCustomers and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the Registrants' ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services, and offerings. Additionally, the risk of global climate change continues to shape customers' and stakeholders' sustainability goals and energy needs.\n\nNew technologies such as distributed energy resources and microgrids and increased customer and stakeholder demand for sustainable assets could change the type of assets constructed and/or the methods for cost recovery. Advances in these technologies or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of distributed generation storage technologies or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy classified debt investments as AFS, with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income until realized. By 2023, this classification remained consistent, but the company emphasized that substantially all AFS debt securities qualified for regulatory accounting, resulting in deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses as regulatory assets or liabilities. Additionally, in 2023, Duke Energy noted that unrealized credit losses on AFS securities were recognized in earnings if identified, though no material credit losses were reported for 2023 or 2022. This reflects a more detailed regulatory treatment of AFS securities in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company recorded a $84 million pre-tax impairment charge related to its equity method investment in Nicor Gas (chunk_1). This financial strain was compounded by regulatory restrictions that limited Nicor Gas from providing money pool loans to affiliates and constrained its ability to dividend or loan up to $1.7 billion in retained earnings (chunk_2). By 2024, Southern Company responded by maintaining a decentralized financing structure, where each jointly-owned entity was responsible for its own financing, as evidenced by the explicit statement that 'each Registrant is responsible for providing its own financing' (chunk_3). This approach reflects a strategic adaptation to the earlier year\u2019s financial challenges and regulatory constraints, ensuring financial independence across subsidiaries while managing capital more cautiously.",

However, some of these agreements expired in May 2023. As a result, in 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased by $87 million (20.5%) compared to 2023, primarily due to a 30.8% drop in the volume of KWHs sold, directly tied to the expiration of those agreements.

The decrease primarily reflects a 30.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended in May 2023.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nIn 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $79 million, or 131.7%, as compared to 2023. The revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of 165.5% in the volume of KWH sales due to affiliated company energy needs.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.

      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power entered into cost-sharing agreements with other Vogtle Owners, including MEAG Power, OPC, and Dalton, which included immediate payments totaling $325 million and future cost-sharing commitments. These agreements shifted a significant portion of the financial burden of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction to Georgia Power, which is reflected in the increase of Georgia Power\u2019s reported investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from $24 million in 2023 to $41 million in 2024. This increase aligns with Georgia Power\u2019s assumption of greater financial responsibility under the agreements, particularly for costs exceeding the current project capital forecast.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Vogtle Owners: Georgia Power assumed additional financial obligations under 2023 agreements with other Vogtle Owners, including $308M to OPC and $17M to Dalton, with future commitments totaling ~$111M based on the project capital cost forecast.",
        "Hop 2: Vogtle Owners \u2192 Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: The Vogtle Owners collectively have a stake in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Georgia Power assuming operational and financial leadership under joint ownership agreements.",
        "Hop 3: Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 \u2190 SO(2024): Georgia Power\u2019s investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 increased from $24 million in 2023 to $41 million in 2024, reflecting the financial impact of the 2023 cost-sharing agreements."
