      "question": "How did the valuation of Marvel as part of DIS's indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022 relate to the integration of Marvel-branded content within Disney+ services in 2023, and how did this affect Disney's overall direct-to-consumer strategy execution in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Marvel was listed as one of Disney's indefinite-lived intangible assets, alongside ESPN and Pixar, indicating its long-term strategic value to DIS. By 2023, Marvel's content was deeply integrated into Disney+, which includes Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic branded programming as top-level selections within the Disney+ interface. This integration suggests that the value of Marvel as an intangible asset directly supported Disney+'s content strategy, which is critical to the company's DTC business\u2014a subscription service offered directly to consumers with branded programming across devices. The continued emphasis on Marvel content in Disney+ indicates that the 2022 valuation of Marvel was instrumental in driving DIS's 2023 DTC execution strategy.",

      "answer": "Disney's notional amount of foreign exchange cash flow hedges increased from $7.4 billion in 2022 to $9.9 billion in 2024, indicating a significant rise in their exposure to foreign currency risk. This increase suggests that Disney expanded its hedging activities to protect against greater volatility in foreign exchange rates. Option contracts played a central role in this strategy, as they were used to hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions, firm commitments, and existing foreign currency assets. The use of these contracts allowed Disney to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of foreign currency-denominated items, thereby stabilizing earnings and cash flows.

The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, ESPNEWS had 56 million subscribers as part of Disney's ESPN portfolio. By 2024, ESPNEWS subscriber numbers dropped to 40 million, while ESPNU, which remained a key college sports channel, had 47 million subscribers.

      "answer": "In 2023, Alphabet emphasized its AI-first strategy and introduced AI into more products, building on over a decade of AI integration. By 2024, this increased reliance on AI subjected the company to a rapidly evolving regulatory environment, including AI-specific laws and broader regulations covering privacy, intellectual property, and content moderation. The complexity and opacity of AI models, especially generative AI, heightened compliance risks and operational transparency challenges, as noted in the 2024 filings. This shows a clear evolution where earlier AI adoption led to greater regulatory scrutiny and internal compliance burdens in the following year.",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

While we inv est significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relev ant results and to detect and prev ent low-quality content and inv alid  traffic,  we  hav e  been  unable  and  may  continue to be unable to detect and prev ent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new av enues of abuse for bad actors.\n\nMany websites violate or attempt to v iolate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relev ance and utility would rank them. Such efforts hav e affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms  and  lead  them  to  display  false,  misleading,  or  undesirable  content. Although  English-language  web  spam  in  our  search  results  has  been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improv e their rankings. Although we continue to inv est in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prev ent web spam on our platforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may hav e negativ e experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect  our  users'  decisions  in  continuing  to  use  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and  irrelev ant  content  websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improv e their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prev ent abuse from low-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including v iolations of our content guidelines inv olv ing incidents such as attempted election interference; activ ities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nIf we fail to either detect and prev ent an increase in problematic content or effectiv ely promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for deliv ering relev ant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and div ert management's time and attention.\n\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\n\nOur products and serv ices depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to  work  effectiv ely.  Currently,  this  access  is  prov ided  by  companies  that  hav e  significant  market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access marketplace,  including  incumbent  telephone  companies,  cable  companies,  mobile  communications  companies,  and  gov ernment-owned  serv ice prov iders. Some of these prov iders hav e taken, or hav e stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  prov ide  our  offerings,  or  by  prov iding  our  competitors  preferential  access.  Some  jurisdictions  hav e  adopted  regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access prov iders; howev er, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and serv ices hav e been subject to gov ernment-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, adv ertisers, and/or content prov iders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negativ ely affecting our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations cov ering a wide v ariety of subjects, and our introduction of  new  businesses,  products,  serv ices,  and  technologies  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  In  recent  years, governments around the world hav e proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relev ant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data priv acy and security, competition, AI, and online content. T he costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations.",

      "question": "How did the voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B common stockholders at GOOGL evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in light of the changes in share repurchase activity and the relative voting rights associated with each class?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Class A common stockholders held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3%, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. By 2024, the voting rights for Class B shares were adjusted to 10 votes per share, signaling a potential shift in governance influence. Over this period, GOOGL repurchased $59.3 billion in shares in 2022 and $62.0 billion in 2024, primarily targeting Class A and Class C shares, which may have indirectly affected the relative influence of Class B stockholders who retain concentrated voting control. This evolution suggests a recalibration of shareholder influence through both structural changes and capital deployment.",

The Company primarily enters into two types of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure. Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment. Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g. forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g. floating-rate debt).\n\nThe Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged occur or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.",

ESPN, which includes the SEC Network as one of its branded channels, is responsible for programming and production costs tied to live sports and original content. By 2023, the SEC Network remained a dedicated channel within ESPN's portfolio, continuing to benefit from Disney's broader sports programming rights investments, which include college football bowl games and the College Football Playoff. The sustained presence of the SEC Network in 2023, alongside ongoing investments in live sports rights, suggests that Disney maintained or expanded its strategic focus on college sports content despite rising costs.",

      "question": "How did the conversion of CMCSA's Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock between 2023 and 2024 impact the total issued shares of Class A Common Stock and the company's retained earnings?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA disclosed that 9,444,375 shares of Class B Common Stock were issued and outstanding. Since Class B shares are convertible share-for-share into Class A Common Stock, the conversion likely contributed to the reduction in issued Class A shares from 4,842,108,959 in 2023 to 4,651,093,045 in 2024. Despite this reduction in issued shares, the company's retained earnings increased from $52,892 million in 2023 to $56,972 million in 2024, suggesting that the capital structure shift did not hinder profit accumulation.",

      "answer": "Disney increased its foreign exchange cash flow hedge notional amounts from $7.4 billion in 2022 to $9.9 billion in 2024, indicating a more aggressive hedging strategy. This growth in hedging activity was achieved through greater use of option and forward contracts to manage foreign currency liabilities, as stated in both the 2022 and 2024 filings. The increase suggests that Disney expanded its use of these financial instruments to protect against exchange rate fluctuations, particularly for forecasted foreign currency transactions involving the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan, and Canadian dollar. The deferred gains in AOCI also shifted from $704 million in 2022 to $99 million in 2024, showing a significant change in the timing and value of hedging outcomes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney used derivatives to hedge forecasted transactions, which included foreign currency-denominated revenues and payables, as part of its risk management strategy. However, these forecasted transactions were explicitly excluded from the VAR model used to estimate the company\u2019s maximum potential one-day loss. In 2023, the VAR model output showed a decrease in combined VAR from $284 million (as of September 30, 2023) to $255 million (as of September 28, 2024), attributed to reduced interest rate volatility. Despite this drop, the continued exclusion of forecasted transactions from the VAR model suggests that the company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange risk\u2014though hedged\u2014was not fully captured in the VAR metric, potentially limiting the model's ability to reflect the full scope of financial risk Disney managed through derivatives.",

      "question": "How did the voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B common stockholders at CMCSA change from 2022 to 2024, and what implications did this have for corporate governance decisions requiring class voting?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Class A common stockholders held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, with Class B common stockholders holding the remaining 33 1/3%, and each share of Class B common stock had 15 votes. By 2024, while the Class A common stock remained widely held with over 4.65 billion issued shares, Class B common stock was significantly less issued, with only 9.4 million shares authorized and outstanding. The governance structure in 2024 maintained that Class B common stockholders could only vote on specific defined matters, such as exiting the core payments business or certain merger transactions. This suggests that while the relative voting power of Class B shares remained concentrated, the overall governance framework continued to limit their influence on general corporate decisions, preserving the dominance of Class A shareholders in most voting scenarios.",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock at CMCSA change from 2023 to 2024, and what was the impact on the relative influence of each class in corporate governance decisions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA disclosed that Class A common stock was registered under Section 12(b) of the Act with a par value of $0.01. By 2024, the company reported that holders of Class A common stock collectively held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock, which had 15 votes per share, held 33 1/3% of the combined voting power. Additionally, in 2024, there were 9,444,375 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding, compared to 4,651,093,045 issued shares of Class A common stock. This indicates that while Class A shares significantly outnumbered Class B shares, the super-voting rights of Class B stock (15 votes per share) preserved a concentrated governance influence, with Mr. Brian L. Roberts owning all Class B shares. This structure maintained a balance where Class A shareholders had majority voting power numerically, but Class B retained outsized influence per share.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2023) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Disclosed registration under Section 12(b) with $0.01 par value, indicating standard equity structure and public market classification.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class A and Class B shares have different voting rights, with Class B having 15 votes per share, creating a dual-class governance structure.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(2024): In 2024, CMCSA disclosed that Class B shares represented 33 1/3% of the combined voting power despite being a small fraction of total shares, with Mr. Roberts owning all Class B stock."

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Class A common stock held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock held 33 1/3%, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes and the Class A voting power being dependent on the number of shares outstanding. By 2023, this structure remained unchanged, with Class A still holding 66 2/3% of the voting power, indicating that despite 4,842,108,959 Class A shares being issued (vs. 5,083,466,045 in 2022), and only 9,444,375 Class B shares outstanding, the ownership structure was intentionally preserved. This suggests that the company maintained a dual-class structure to ensure continued control by the Class B shareholders, such as Brian L. Roberts, while allowing broader public ownership through Class A shares.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Class A common stockholders held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3%, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes and owned entirely by Brian L. Roberts. By 2024, the issued and outstanding shares of Class A increased from 4,651,093,045 (2022) to 4,842,108,959 (2024), while Class B shares remained constant at 9,444,375. This suggests that although the relative voting balance remained stable due to the non-dilutable nature of Class B stock, the absolute number of Class A shares grew, potentially increasing public shareholder influence over time despite concentrated control in Class B.",

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L.

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney introduced Star+ as a standalone service or bundled with Disney+ in Latin America (Combo+), expanding its international DTC footprint. Star+ served as a general entertainment offering complementary to Disney+. By 2024, this expansion contributed to a 10% increase in subscription fees driven by higher effective rates from retail pricing increases, partly due to the broader international adoption and bundling strategy initiated with Star+. The inclusion of Star+ in the Disney+ interface outside the U.S. and Latin America further supported subscriber growth and pricing power. This demonstrates how the 2022 launch of Star+ played a pivotal role in shaping Disney+'s revenue trajectory and pricing strategy two years later.",

By 2024, this financial support shifted directly to DIS, which provided a 1.9 billion yuan (approximately $0.3 billion) line of credit at the same 8% interest rate.

Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. Fair value was determined using estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 2 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).\n\n## Credit Concentrations\n\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments on an ongoing basis and does not currently anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n\nThe Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of September 28, 2024, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company generally enters into derivative transactions only with counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better and requires collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or aggregate ex posures ex ceed limits as defined by contract. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.\n\nThe Company does not have material cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that have below investment grade credit ratings and maintains short-term liquidity balances in high quality money market funds. At September 28, 2024, the Company's balances (excluding money market funds) with individual financial institutions that ex ceeded 10% of the Company's total cash and cash equivalents were 24% of total cash and cash equivalents.

          "chunk_text": "\nThe fair value of Level 2 investments are primarily determined based on an internal valuation model that uses observable inputs such as stock trading price, volatility and risk free rate.\n\nThe fair values of Level 2 derivatives are primarily determined by internal discounted cash flow models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency exchange rates. Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. Fair value was determined using estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 2 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).\n\n## Credit Concentrations\n\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments on an ongoing basis and does not currently anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n\nThe Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of September 28, 2024, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company generally enters into derivative transactions only with counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better and requires collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or aggregate ex posures ex ceed limits as defined by contract. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.\n\nThe Company does not have material cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that have below investment grade credit ratings and maintains short-term liquidity balances in high quality money market funds. At September 28, 2024, the Company's balances (excluding money market funds) with individual financial institutions that ex ceeded 10% of the Company's total cash and cash equivalents were 24% of total cash and cash equivalents. At September 30,",

The VAR model's estimated one-day loss decreased from $284 million in 2023 to $255 million in 2024 due to lower interest rate volatility.

While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company's computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt, interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis decreased to $255 million at September 28, 2024 from $284 million at September 30, 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Disney's foreign exchange cash flow hedge notional amounts increased from $8.3 billion in 2023 to $9.9 billion in 2024, indicating a heightened focus on managing foreign currency liabilities. This increase was achieved primarily through the expanded use of option and forward contracts, which are used to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities. The growth in hedge notional amounts suggests a more aggressive hedging strategy, particularly as the company transacts business globally in currencies such as the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, and Chinese yuan.

The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions.

The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the change in Verizon's leasing strategy for wireless towers from 2023 to 2024, including the new transaction with Vertical Bridge, affect its ongoing relationship and financial obligations with American Tower Corporation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon maintained a long-standing leasing relationship with American Tower Corporation, subleasing capacity on approximately 11,300 towers at market rates from the 2015 agreement. By 2024, Verizon introduced a new leasing partner, Vertical Bridge, through which it leased over 6,000 additional towers under a 30-year average term with renewal options. This shift introduced a dual leasing model, where Verizon continues to sublease from American Tower while also subleasing from Vertical Bridge. Financially, Verizon recorded a $2.0 billion prepaid rent and $830 million financing obligation related to the Vertical Bridge deal, indicating a more complex capital structure and risk profile. Despite this, Verizon remains the primary obligor on the underlying ground leases for both American Tower and Vertical Bridge, maintaining similar exposure to lease liabilities as in 2023, though now across two leasing partners.",

        "Hop 1: VZ(2023) \u2192 Wireless Towers: Verizon subleases 11,300 towers from American Tower at market rates from the 2015 deal, with towers still on balance sheet.",
        "Hop 2: Wireless Towers \u2192 American Tower Corporation: American Tower assumed interest in underlying ground leases, responsible for payments, but Verizon remains the primary obligor.",
        "Hop 3: American Tower Corporation \u2190 VZ(2024): Verizon adds Vertical Bridge as a new tower lessor in 2024, leasing over 6,000 towers with a 30-year term, and records $2.0B prepaid rent and $830M financing obligation."

Leasing Arrangements\n\nWe enter into  various  lease  arrangements  for  network  equipment  including  towers,  distributed  antenna  systems,  small  cells,  real  estate  and  connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n\nDuring December 2024, we completed a transaction with V ertical Bridge REIT , LLC (V ertical Bridge) pursuant to which V ertical Bridge obtained the exclusive rights  to  lease,  operate  and  manage  over 6,000  wireless  towers  from  V erizon  in  exchange  for  an  upfront  payment  of  $2.8  billion.  Under  the  terms  of  the agreement, Vertical Bridge has exclusive rights to lease, operate and manage the towers over an average term of approximately 30 years, with the option to acquire the towers at the end of the lease terms. We have leased back a portion of the capacity on the towers from V ertical Bridge for an initial term of 10 years, with eight optional renewal terms of five years each, subject to certain early termination rights.

The  upfront  payment,  which  is  primarily  included  within  Other  liabilities  on  our consolidated balance sheet, is accounted for as prepaid rent and as a financing obligation. We recorded prepaid rent of $2.0 billion related to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to V ertical Bridge, which is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we recorded a financing obligation of $830 million related to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring M arch 2015, we completed a transaction with A merican T ower Corporation (A merican T ower) pursuant to which A merican T ower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly.\n\nIn addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to these towers. While V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower can renegotiate the terms of and are responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the primary obligor for these leases and accordingly , the present value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities.

This shift redistributed the voting power previously concentrated in the 9.4 million Class B shares among Class A shareholders, who increased from 3.78 billion to 3.97 billion outstanding shares.

      "question": "How did the voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B common stock at CMCSA change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this imply about shareholder control concentration?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Class B common stock, held entirely by Brian L. Roberts, represented 33 1/3% of the combined voting power despite only 3 record holders, while Class A common stock had 352,581 holders and held 66 2/3% of the voting power. By 2023, the continued registration of Class A common stock on Nasdaq indicated ongoing public trading, but the structural voting imbalance persisted, maintaining disproportionate control with Class B shareholders despite the large number of Class A holders. This voting power structure, where each Class B share carries 15 votes, ensures continued concentration of control within a very small group even as the broader shareholder base expands.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Only 3 record holders of Class B shares, which carry 15 votes per share and represent 33 1/3% of voting power",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Structural voting relationship where Class B holds 33 1/3% and Class A holds 66 2/3% despite far more holders",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(2023): Class A common stock remained registered on Nasdaq in 2023 with broad public ownership, but voting power remained capped at 66 2/3%"

      "answer": "In 2023, Class B common stock had 15 votes per share and represented 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, while Class A common stock held the remaining 66 2/3%. By 2024, the issued shares of Class A common stock decreased from 4,842,108,959 to 4,651,093,045, indicating a reduction of 191,015,914 shares. This change suggests that despite the consistent non-dilutable voting power of Class B shares, the company actively managed its Class A share structure, likely to maintain control dynamics while reducing outstanding shares.",

      "question": "How did the voting rights structure of GOOGL's Class A and Class B shares influence its $62.0 billion 2024 share repurchase strategy, especially considering that repurchases continued to focus on Class A and Class C shares rather than Class B?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL disclosed the structure of its three stock classes, where Class B shares carried 10 votes per share and automatically converted to Class A shares upon sale or transfer. By 2024, the company repurchased $62.0 billion worth of Class A and Class C shares, continuing a strategy seen in prior years. The decision to focus repurchases on Class A and Class C shares\u2014rather than Class B\u2014was likely influenced by the desire to avoid triggering automatic conversions of high-vote Class B shares into Class A, which could dilute the voting control held by key stakeholders. This reflects a strategic alignment between capital allocation and governance structure.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL(2022) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Discloses stock class structure and voting rights, including that Class B shares carry 10 votes and convert to Class A upon sale or transfer.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Both classes have identical rights except for voting, with Class B shares holding significantly more voting power and converting to Class A upon sale.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL(2024): The 2024 share repurchase program focused on Class A and Class C shares, avoiding repurchasing Class B shares, likely to preserve concentrated voting control."

This consistency in assessment, despite the extended timeline and ongoing market transition from LIBOR to alternative rates like SOFR, indicates that AT&T's exposure to affected contracts remained limited or manageable.

We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and expenses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3). Operations in countries with highly inflationary economies use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.\n\nWe hedge a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk involved in certain foreign currency-denominated transactions, which we explain further in our discussion of our methods of managing our foreign currency risk (see Note 13).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 15 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\nReference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting' (ASU 2020-04, as amended), which provides optional expedients, and allows for certain exceptions to existing GAAP, for contract modifications triggered by the expected market transition of certain benchmark interest rates to alternative reference rates. ASU 2020-04 applies to contracts, hedging relationships, certain derivatives and other arrangements that reference the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or any other rates ending after December 31, 2022. ASU 2020-04, as amended, became effective immediately. We do not believe our adoption of ASU 2020-04, including optional expedients, will materially impact our financial statements.\n\nConvertible Instruments Beginning with 2022 interim reporting, we will adopt ASU No. 2020-06, 'Debt-Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity' (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 eliminated certain separation models regarding cash conversion and beneficial conversion features to simplify reporting for convertible instruments as a single liability or equity, with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Additionally, ASU 202006 requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock are presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earnings per share. While our intent is to settle the Mobility II preferred interests in cash (see Note 17), settlement of this instrument in AT&amp;T shares will result in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&amp;T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. We are currently evaluating our adoption method and the impact on our financial statements, as our recent decision (February 2022) on methodology of distribution to AT&amp;T's shareholders (i.e., pro rata dividend) for the pending WarnerMedia transaction could affect the impact of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements (see Note 6).\n\nGovernment Assistance In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, 'Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance' (ASU 2021-10), which requires annual disclosures, in the notes to the financial statements, about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other guidance. The annual disclosures include terms and conditions, accounting treatment and impacted financial statement lines reflecting the impact of the transactions. ASU 2021-10 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, under prospective or retrospective application for all in scope government transactions in the financial statements as of our adoption date or thereafter. We are evaluating the disclosure impacts of our adoption of ASU 2021-10.",

      "answer": "Disney's 2023 filings highlight the regulatory framework of Rule 10b5-1(c), which establishes requirements for insider trading plans to qualify for an affirmative defense against insider trading claims. This regulatory context directly shaped the design of Robert Iger's 2024 trading plan, which was explicitly structured to comply with the rule. The plan specifically accommodated the expiration of Iger\u2019s stock options on December 18, 2024, and outlined a schedule for the potential sale of up to 372,412 shares of Disney common stock. The plan's termination date of December 17, 2024, just one day before the options expired, demonstrates how the timing was carefully aligned with both the regulatory requirements from 2023 and the specific financial instruments involved in Iger\u2019s compensation package.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Class A common stock held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock held 33 1/3%, with Class B shares carrying 15 votes each and being non-dilutable. By 2024, the structure remained consistent in terms of voting percentages, with Class A shares still dependent on the outstanding count relative to Class B shares, which remained fixed at 9,444,375 shares. The convertibility of Class B shares into Class A shares, as noted in the 2024 filing, introduced a potential mechanism for shifting ownership structure over time, although no such change occurred in the total number of Class B shares.

      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL had 300,754,904 shares of Class A common stock and 44,576,938 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, with Class A shareholders holding a majority of the voting power due to the 1 vote per share structure, versus 10 votes per share for Class B. By 2024, GOOGL had repurchased $62.0 billion worth of shares, including both Class A and Class C shares, though Class B shares retained their 10-vote per share advantage and could only be converted to Class A shares upon sale or transfer. Despite these repurchases, the relative voting power of Class B shares remained disproportionately high, with Class B shareholders like Mr. Brian L. Roberts maintaining concentrated control, similar to the structure seen in other firms like Comcast where Class B shares held 33 1/3% of the combined voting power. This suggests that while share repurchases reduced overall share counts, the governance structure remained skewed in favor of Class B shareholders.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL disclosed the structure of its Class A and Class B common stock, with Class B shares holding significantly more voting power and being convertible into Class A shares. By 2024, the company maintained this dual-class structure but allowed Class B shares to convert automatically upon sale or transfer, reinforcing control by long-term holders. Additionally, the $62.0 billion share repurchase program in 2024 focused on Class A and Class C shares, which could reduce the number of outstanding shares and increase the proportional influence of Class B shareholders who retain higher voting rights. This evolution suggests a strategic reinforcement of control by key stakeholders, supported by the continued repurchase of lower-vote shares.",

      "answer": "The decline in ESPNEWS subscribers from 56 million in 2022 to 40 million in 2023 coincided with ESPN's strategic shift toward digital platforms, particularly ESPN+, which had 26 million estimated paid subscribers by September 2024 as noted in the 2023 report. This suggests that Disney is prioritizing direct-to-consumer digital sports content delivery over traditional linear channels like ESPNEWS. The temporal relationship indicates a reallocation of audience engagement efforts toward on-demand, bundled, and mobile-based platforms, aligning with broader industry trends and potentially impacting Disney's sports network revenue mix by reducing reliance on traditional MVPD subscriber models.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META disclosed that its dual-class structure, where Class B stock retained 35% of combined voting power, created governance risks by limiting board independence and making the company less attractive to some investors. The 2023 filing specifically noted that any change in control required approval from a majority of Class B stockholders. In 2024, despite Class B conversions to Class A on a one-for-one basis, META still maintained a dual-class structure with 343,761,117 shares of Class B stock outstanding. This preserved the governance imbalance, as Class B stockholders retained outsized influence through staggered board terms and limited stockholder action mechanisms. The 2024 filing confirmed the continued existence of these structural limitations, indicating that investor concerns about reduced corporate governance protections and potential stock price depression remained relevant.",

      "answer": "In 2023, T used unobservable inputs such as projected terminal growth rates, long-term EBITDA margins, and weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in its goodwill impairment testing for the Consumer Wireline and Business Wireline reporting units, which involved discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. These assumptions were subject to sensitivity analyses and third-party valuation specialist review. In 2024, T disclosed that its private equity funds\u2014valued using the NAV practical expedient\u2014were based on valuation models that also incorporated unobservable inputs that could not be corroborated by market data. Despite being applied to different asset classes, both valuation approaches reflect T's continued reliance on complex, judgment-driven models with significant unobservable assumptions. This indicates a consistent but potentially risky valuation methodology framework across years, where fair value estimates are highly sensitive to changes in key assumptions.",

        "Hop 1: T(2023) \u2192 Valuation Models: T used unobservable inputs like terminal growth rates, EBITDA margins, and WACC in its goodwill impairment testing for reporting units, with a $67,854 million goodwill balance at year-end.",
        "Hop 2: Valuation Models \u2192 Private Equity Funds: Private equity fund valuations rely on NAV derived from valuation models with unobservable inputs, similar to the goodwill impairment models used by T in 2023.",

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, reporting unit goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. Estimating fair values in connection with these impairment evaluations involves the utilization of discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                                          | Auditing management's annual goodwill impairment test for the Consumer Wireline and Business Wireline reporting units was complex because the estimation of fair values involves subjective management assumptions, such as projected terminal growth rates, projected long-term EBITDA margins, and weighted average cost of capital, and complex valuation methodologies, such as the discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. Assumptions used in these valuation models are forward-looking, and changes in these assumptions can have a material effect on the determination of fair value.                                                                                                                                   |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain controls over the Company's impairment evaluation processes.

By 2024, the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock were 9,444,375, while Class A had 4,651,093,045 issued shares.

      "answer": "In 2022 and 2023, GOOGL repurchased $59.3 billion and $62.2 billion worth of shares, respectively, but only repurchased Class A and Class C shares, not Class B. Since Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and can only be converted into Class A shares (which carry 1 vote per share), and given that Class B shares are not subject to repurchase, the company\u2019s repurchase strategy preserved the voting power of the remaining shares. This selective repurchase approach likely increased the relative proportion of Class B shares in the capital structure over time, reinforcing control by insiders.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL(2022) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: In 2022, GOOGL disclosed share classes and repurchased only Class A and Class C shares, leaving Class B untouched.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class B shares can convert one-way into Class A shares but are not eligible for repurchase due to their insider ownership and voting rights.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META's dual-class structure, where Class B shares carried disproportionate voting rights, posed governance risks by allowing the controlling shareholder to influence key decisions and potentially depress Class A stock prices. This structure included a provision requiring Class B majority approval for change-in-control transactions until their voting power dropped below 35%. As of December 31, 2024, META still maintained this dual-class framework, with Class B shares representing 343,761,117 of the total outstanding shares, ensuring continued concentration of voting control. The structural relationship between Class A and Class B shares remained intact, with Class B shares convertible to Class A on a 1:1 basis, preserving the governance dynamics that contributed to investor concerns outlined in the prior year.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META's Class B common stock was not publicly traded and had only 23 stockholders of record, while Class A common stock was actively traded on Nasdaq. Class B shares could convert on a one-for-one basis into Class A shares, but Class A shares held by Class B stockholders post-conversion had to be sold or transferred. In 2024, META introduced its first-ever cash dividend policy, applying equally to both Class A and Class B common stock at $0.50 per share. This change likely altered the incentive structure for Class B stockholders, as they now receive dividend income, potentially affecting the frequency or volume of Class B-to-Class A conversions and subsequent Class A share sales.

By 2023, the tower asset balance decreased to $647, while depreciation expense remained stable at $39. Meanwhile, T's sublease payments to Crown Castle increased from $264 in 2023, with future minimum payments projected to rise annually through 2028. This indicates that despite stable depreciation, T's financial obligations to Crown Castle are increasing over time, reflecting the ongoing nature of the financing obligation and sublease commitments tied to the original 2013 tower transaction.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA disclosed that Class B Common Stock had only 3 record holders but carried significant voting power. By 2023, it was revealed that Class B shares (which are convertible share-for-share into Class A) held a non-dilutable 33\u2153% of the total voting power, while Class A shareholders collectively held 66\u2154%. The convertibility feature of Class B shares into Class A shares, combined with each Class B share carrying 15 votes, suggests that the small group of Class B shareholders could maintain outsized influence even as they transition to Class A holdings. This dynamic preserves the strategic control of key stakeholders while allowing flexibility in equity structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA disclosed that Class B Common Stock had only 3 record holders, while Class A Common Stock had 352,581 record holders, indicating a highly concentrated ownership structure for Class B. The conversion mechanism allows Class B shares to convert on a one-for-one basis into Class A shares, but with restrictions: only specific entities can hold Class B shares, and upon conversion to Class A, those entities are required to sell or transfer the resulting Class A shares. By 2023, CMCSA continued to register Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ, suggesting ongoing trading activity. This implies that while conversions may occur, the structural limitations on Class B holders likely preserved the concentration of ownership, with converted shares entering broader public circulation but not altering the core governance dynamics tied to Class B shares.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney had $8.3 billion in notional amounts of foreign exchange cash flow hedges, many of which were tied to firm commitments. These hedges were intended to offset fluctuations in the value of those commitments. However, the VAR model used in 2024 explicitly excluded firm commitments from its calculations, even though the total notional amount of foreign exchange hedges increased to $9.9 billion by 2024. Despite this increase in hedging activity, the VAR estimate of maximum one-day loss decreased from $284 million in 2023 to $255 million in 2024, primarily due to lower interest rate volatility. This suggests that while Disney increased its hedge coverage year-over-year, the risk profile as measured by VAR improved, but firm commitments were not factored into the model that determines this risk exposure.",

      "question": "How did the dividend payout structure for GOOGL's Class A and Class B stock evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's capital allocation strategy across different share classes?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GOOGL's dividend policy ensured equal per-share dividends across all share classes (Class A, B, and C), as mandated by the company's certificate of incorporation and Delaware law, which prevented unequal dividend distributions without class-specific approval. By 2024, GOOGL paid $3.5 billion in dividends to Class A shareholders and $519 million to Class B shareholders, indicating a continuation of equal per-share treatment despite Class B shares not being publicly traded. This reveals that GOOGL maintained a consistent capital allocation strategy favoring equity among share classes, even as total dividend amounts varied across classes due to differences in outstanding shares and holder structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL(2023) \u2192 Class A Stock: Equal dividend rights across all share classes were contractually enforced, with no unequal distributions permitted without unanimous board approval and class-specific stockholder consent.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Stock \u2192 Class B Stock: Both share classes received equal per-share dividends, though Class B shares were not publicly traded and had different voting rights.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Stock \u2190 GOOGL(2024): In 2024, Class B shareholders received $519 million in dividends, significantly less than the $3.5 billion paid to Class A shareholders, reflecting the smaller number of Class B shares outstanding."

Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no public market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither listed nor traded.

As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 57 stockholders of record of our Class B stock.\n\n## Dividend Program\n\nDiv idend payments to stockholders of Class A, Class B, and Class C shares were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion, respectiv ely, for the year ended December 31, 2024.

This governance structure was tied to the dual-class framework where Class B shares, convertible to Class A, held 10 votes per share, giving controlling stockholders disproportionate influence.

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA disclosed that Class B common stock had only 3 record holders and carried limited voting rights tied to specific corporate actions, such as mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation. By 2024, Class B common stock was no longer present in the capital structure, as shown by its disappearance from the equity section of the balance sheet. This structural change concentrated voting power exclusively among Class A common stockholders, who retained full voting rights on all matters. Concurrently, CMCSA's total equity increased from $82.703 billion in 2023 to $85.560 billion in 2024\u2014a $2.857 billion increase\u2014suggesting that the removal of Class B shares may have simplified governance while enhancing equity value for remaining shareholders.",

      "answer": "The share repurchase program, which focused on Class A and Class C shares in both 2023 ($62.2 billion) and 2024 ($62.0 billion), likely reduced the number of Class A shares outstanding at a faster rate than Class B shares, since Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon transfer but were not directly targeted in repurchases. This dynamic, combined with the voting rights disparity (Class B holds 10 votes per share vs. Class A\u2019s 1 vote), may have increased the relative voting power of remaining Class B shareholders over time, even as the overall equity base was reduced through buybacks.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL(2023) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: In 2023, Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, reducing the total Class A shares outstanding.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, but were not directly included in the repurchase program, preserving their voting power.",

      "question": "How did the change in Disney's relationship with A+E between 2022 and 2024 affect the financial performance of their equity stake, considering the subscriber base of Lifetime in 2022 and the gain from the content license termination in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney had a partners_with relationship with Lifetime, which was part of A+E, a joint venture where Disney held a 50% stake. At that time, Lifetime had 69 million subscribers, indicating a strong subscriber base contributing to A+E's revenue. By 2024, Disney's relationship with A+E had evolved, marked by the termination of a content license agreement, which generated a $56 million gain for Disney (50% of the A+E gain). This suggests that while Disney maintained its equity stake in A+E, the shift in content licensing strategy led to a financial benefit, despite potential changes in the subscriber dynamics of the channels like Lifetime. The evolution from a subscriber-based partnership to a stake-based financial gain reflects a strategic shift in how Disney leveraged its relationship with A+E through the Lifetime-A&E chain.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ESPN2 had 74 million subscribers, matching ESPN's subscriber count, indicating a strong traditional cable footprint. By 2024, ESPN2's subscriber base dropped to 66 million, aligning with ESPN's own count, suggesting a synchronized decline in traditional distribution. This decline coincided with Disney's intensified focus on ESPN+, which reached 26 million paid subscribers by September 2024.

By 2023, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock had increased from 4,842,108,959 to 5,083,466,045 (issued) and from 3,969,317,931 to 4,210,675,017 (outstanding), indicating continued issuance activity. This increase in Class A shares could have diluted the proportional ownership of Class B stock, though its voting power remained non-dilutable under the company's charter.

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that its content amortization was based on historical and forecasted viewing patterns, and the auditor tested the significant assumptions including historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption used to develop estimated viewing patterns. In 2023, the auditor again tested the same assumptions, indicating that Netflix continued to rely on similar methodologies involving viewing hour consumption to amortize content. The consistency in auditor testing procedures across both years suggests that Netflix did not materially change its amortization methodology or the underlying assumptions between 2022 and 2023, despite the subjective and complex nature of estimating future viewing patterns.",

      "answer": "In 2022, holders of Class A common stock collectively held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock, which is non-dilutable, held 33 1/3% with each share carrying 15 votes. By 2023, the Class B common stock remained convertible share-for-share into Class A common stock, but the 33 1/3% voting power of Class B shares was still non-dilutable. This means that despite any conversions from Class B to Class A, the total voting power of Class B shares remained fixed at 33 1/3%, preserving the relative voting balance between the two classes. The mechanism ensured that the voting power distribution was maintained even as the actual number of shares outstanding may have changed.",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T allocated 7% of its pension assets to Real Assets, which included Infrastructure investments characterized by their long-term, predictable, and stable cash flows. However, in 2023, the company disclosed significant risks associated with Infrastructure, including exposure to natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires, cyberattacks that could disrupt operations, and other operational vulnerabilities that may lead to service degradation and costly recovery efforts. This creates a conflict, as the previously emphasized stability of Infrastructure investments is now shown to be at odds with the growing operational and environmental risks that could undermine those very characteristics.",

Private equity: Investments in private or public securities typically through privately-negotiated and/or structured transactions, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed debt. Private credit: Investments focused on debt instruments, of which returns are driven by income rather than capital appreciation. Infrastructure: Investments in real assets, typically with long-term, predictable, and stable cash flows and a meaningful income component. | Investments in real estate, special situations, private equity, private credit, and infrastructure are typically invested in private partnerships and/or other pooled vehicles (Funds) which are generally classified as Net Asset Value as a Practical Expedient, since the Funds and underlying assets are not publicly traded and/or often have liquidity restrictions. The managers of the Funds value the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the nature of the underlying investments. Techniques may include purchase multiples for comparable transactions, comparable public company trading multiples, discounted cash flow analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates, recent sales of comparable investments, and independent third-party appraisals. The total market value of each of the Funds is determined by aggregating the value of the underlying assets less liabilities. |\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney maintained a 43% ownership stake in Shendi, which held the majority 57% interest in Shanghai Disney Resort. This stake established Disney's strategic alignment with Shendi in managing the resort. By 2023, both Disney and Shendi had expanded their financial support to the resort through dedicated credit facilities\u2014Shendi provided a 2.6 billion yuan ($0.4 billion) line of credit, while Disney extended a 1.9 billion yuan ($0.3 billion) line of credit. The coordinated increase in these credit facilities suggests a joint effort to enhance liquidity and financial flexibility for Shanghai Disney Resort, aligning with their shared interest in the resort\u2019s long-term success and expansion.",

The resort is located in the Pudong district of Shanghai on approximately 1,000 acres of land, which includes the Shanghai Disneyland theme park; two themed resort hotels; a retail, dining and entertainment complex (Disneytown); and an outdoor recreation area. A management company, in which the Company has a 70% interest and Shendi has a 30% interest, is responsible for operating the resort and receives a management fee based on the operating performance of Shanghai Disney Resort. The Company is also entitled to royalties based on the resort's revenues.\n\nShanghai Disneyland - Shanghai Disneyland consists of seven themed areas: Adventure Isle, Fantasyland, Gardens of Imagination, Mickey Avenue, Tomorrowland, Toy Story Land and Treasure Cove. These areas feature themed attractions, shows, restaurants, merchandise shops and entertainment experiences. The Company is constructing an eighth themed area based on the animated film Zootopia .\n\nHotels and Other Facilities - Shanghai Disneyland Resort includes two themed hotels with a total of 1,220 rooms. Disneytown is an 11-acre outdoor complex of dining, shopping and entertainment venues located adjacent to Shanghai Disneyland. Most Disneytown facilities are operated by third parties that pay rent to Shanghai Disney Resort.\n\n## Tokyo Disney Resort\n\nTokyo Disney Resort is located on 494 acres of land, six miles east of downtown Tokyo, Japan. The Company earns royalties on revenues generated by the Tokyo Disney Resort, which is owned and operated by Oriental Land Co., Ltd. (OLC), a third-party Japanese corporation. The resort includes two theme parks (Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea); five Disney-branded hotels; six other hotels (operated by third parties other than OLC); a retail, dining and entertainment complex (Ikspiari); and Bon Voyage, a Disney-themed merchandise location.\n\nTokyo Disneyland - Tokyo Disneyland consists of seven themed areas: Adventureland, Critter Country, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Toontown, Westernland and World Bazaar.\n\nTokyo DisneySea - Tokyo DisneySea is divided into seven 'ports of call,' including American Waterfront, Arabian Coast, Lost River Delta, Mediterranean Harbor, Mermaid Lagoon, Mysterious Island and Port Discovery.

OLC is currently constructing a 475-room Disney-branded hotel at Tokyo DisneySea that is expected to open in spring 2024.\n\n## Disney Vacation Club (DVC)\n\nDVC offers ownership interests in 15 resort facilities located at the Walt Disney World Resort; Disneyland Resort; Aulani; Vero Beach, Florida; and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Available units are offered for sale under a vacation ownership plan and are operated as hotel rooms when not occupied by vacation club members. The Company's vacation club units range from deluxe studios to three-bedroom grand villas. Unit counts in this document are presented in terms of two-bedroom equivalents. DVC had approximately 4,400 vacation club units as of October 1, 2022 and is scheduled to open an additional 135 units at The Villas at Disneyland Hotel in 2023. The Company also plans to open additional units at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort in late 2024.\n\n## Storyliving by Disney\n\nThe Company is developing its first Storyliving by Disney residential community, Cotino, in Rancho Mirage, California.\n\n## Disney Cruise Line\n\nDisney Cruise Line is a five-ship vacation cruise line, which operates out of ports in North America and Europe. The Disney Magic and the Disney Wonder are 85,000-ton 875-stateroom ships; the Disney Dream and the Disney Fantasy are 130,000-ton 1,250-stateroom ships; and the Disney Wish, launched in July 2022, is a 140,000-ton 1,250-stateroom ship. The ships cater to families, children, teenagers and adults, with themed areas and activities for each group. Many cruise vacations include a visit to Disney's Castaway Cay, a 1,000-acre private Bahamian island.\n\nDisney Cruise Line is adding the Disney Treasure and a seventh ship, which are to be delivered from the shipyard in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, respectively. Both of these ships will be approximately 140,000 tons with 1,250 staterooms and will be powered by liquefied natural gas.\n\nIn November 2022, the Company purchased a partially completed ship for an amount that is not material. The ship will be approximately 200,000 tons. Disney Cruise Line will incur the cost to complete construction with total costs anticipated to be less than our recent fleet additions. This ship is expected to be delivered in 2025.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney reported that ESPN2 was one of its seven 24-hour domestic sports channels, with programming and production costs being a major component of Sports' operating expenses. These costs included amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs for live sports and original programming. ESPN2, along with ESPN, had an estimated 66 million subscribers in 2023, indicating a mature linear TV business model with significant fixed programming costs.\n\nBy 2024, Disney introduced ESPN+ as a strategic growth priority, reporting approximately 26 million paid subscribers to the direct-to-consumer service. This marked a shift from the traditional linear TV model represented by ESPN2 toward a digital-first DTC approach with subscription fees, pay-per-view, and advertising revenue streams. The 2024 emphasis on ESPN+ growth contrasts with the 2023 focus on traditional sports programming costs, signaling a strategic pivot toward digital distribution and subscriber monetization models.",

      "question": "How did the change in the number of Class B Common Stock holders from 2022 to 2024, and its convertibility to Class A Common Stock, impact the voting power distribution between the two stock classes in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, there were only 3 holders of Class B Common Stock, which carry significantly higher voting rights (15 votes per share). By 2024, the Class B Common Stock remained convertible share-for-share into Class A Common Stock, but the total issued and outstanding shares of Class B were just 9,444,375. Despite their small number, these Class B shares retained 33\u2153% of the total voting power, a non-dilutable right that ensured concentrated voting control. Meanwhile, the much larger volume of Class A Common Stock had a diluted per-share voting power dependent on total outstanding shares, resulting in a structural governance imbalance favoring Class B holders.",

      "answer": "Disney's VAR exposure decreased from $395 million in 2022 to $255 million in 2024, indicating a significant reduction in the maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of its financial instruments, including foreign exchange derivatives. This decline suggests that the company's foreign exchange derivative strategies, which included currency swaps to hedge forecasted exposures and convert foreign currency borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated liabilities, were effective in mitigating risk. The VAR model, which incorporates all foreign exchange derivatives in its calculation, showed that the company's risk management approach successfully reduced exposure, particularly due to lower interest rate volatility observed in 2024.",

By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.\n\nIt is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.\n\n## Value at Risk (VAR)\n\nThe Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis increased to $395 million at October 1, 2022 from $364 million at October 2, 2021.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

In 2024, GOOGL began paying quarterly dividends, distributing $3.5 billion to Class A shareholders during the year. The Certificate of Incorporation, as reinforced by Delaware law, prevents the Board from declaring unequal per-share dividends across share classes, which directly links the repurchase and dividend policies to the governance structure.

(1)\n\nRepurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other inv estment opportunities, through open market purchases or priv ately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not hav e an expiration date.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash div idends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectiv ely.\n\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash div idends in the future, subject to rev iew and approv al by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\n\n## Note 12. Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using  the  weighted-av erage  number  of  shares  outstanding  during  the  period.  Diluted  net  income  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-av erage number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutiv e securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutiv e securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutiv e effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conv ersion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conv ersion of those shares.\n\nIn accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and div idend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to v oting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law , which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share div idends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law prov ides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would hav e the effect of adv ersely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a giv en class of stock must be approv ed by the class of stock adv ersely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation prov ides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder v ote, it must be approv ed by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors.",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock at CMCSA in 2022 compare to 2024, and what does this imply about the stability of shareholder control despite changes in equity structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Class A common stockholders held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3%, with Class B shares having 15 votes per share. By 2024, the issued and outstanding shares of Class A increased from 4,651,093,045 to 4,842,108,959, while Class B shares remained constant at 9,444,375. This suggests that while the equity structure evolved with more Class A shares issued, the non-dilutable nature of Class B voting power preserved the control dynamics, maintaining the relative influence of Mr. Brian L. Roberts, who owns all Class B shares.",

        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The voting structure ties Class A and Class B shares together, with Class B representing a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of voting power.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney's ESPN network included traditional linear channels like ESPNEWS with 56 million subscribers, relying on MVPD distribution and advertising revenue. By 2023, Disney shifted strategy toward direct-to-consumer offerings like ESPN+, which had 26 million paid subscribers and exclusive UFC PPV rights, enabling higher monetization per subscriber through subscription fees and pay-per-view. Internationally, ESPN expanded to 55 million subscribers across 115 countries. This transition from traditional linear to DTC platforms allowed Disney to capture more direct consumer revenue streams and improve monetization flexibility through bundling with Disney+ and Hulu.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL had 44,576,938 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, each carrying 10 votes, compared to 300,754,904 shares of Class A common stock, each carrying 1 vote. This structure gave Class A shareholders a majority of the voting power, though Class B shareholders still held significant influence. By 2024, the company continued repurchasing both Class A and Class C shares, spending $62.0 billion in that year alone, with $44.7 billion remaining available under the new $70.0 billion repurchase authorization. The dual-class structure allowed GOOGL to maintain control while aggressively repurchasing shares, as the repurchases disproportionately affected the float of Class A and Class C shares without diluting the voting power of the Class B shares, which remained unchanged.",

Marvel was a core component of Disney+ offerings, featured prominently in the interface alongside other major brands like Pixar and Star Wars (DIS_10k_2022.pdf:page_12).

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nsuccessfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively.

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney disclosed floating-rate borrowings with a weighted-average coupon rate and noted the notional values of interest rate and cross-currency swaps outstanding as of October 1, 2022, which were used to manage interest rate exposure. By 2024, although the company still had the capacity to use pay-fixed interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate borrowings to fixed-rate, it explicitly stated that it had no pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at September 28, 2024, or September 30, 2023. This indicates a strategic shift or reduced emphasis on active interest rate hedging, suggesting Disney may have opted to bear more interest rate risk or found alternative methods to manage it. The absence of designated hedges in 2024 implies a more passive approach to interest rate risk compared to 2022, despite the ongoing presence of floating-rate debt.",

The discount rate has a significant effect on the measurement of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and auditing the discount rate was complex because it required an evaluation of the credit quality of the corporate bonds used to develop the discount rate and the correlation of those bonds' cash inflows to the timing and amount of future expected benefit payments. obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain controls management's review of the determination of the discount rates used in the defined benefit pension and benefit obligations calculations. test the determination of the discount rate used in the calculation of the defined benefit pension and benefit obligations, we performed audit procedures that focused on evaluating, with the                        |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | We over postretirement To postretirement assistance of our actuarial specialists, the determination of the discount rates, among other procedures. For example, we evaluated the selected yield curve used to determine the discount rates applied in measuring the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations. As part of this assessment, we considered the credit quality of the corporate bonds that comprise the yield curve and compared the timing and amount of cash flows at maturity with the expected amounts and duration of the related benefit payments. Evaluation of goodwill for impairment At December 31, 2021, the Company's goodwill balance was $133,223 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, reporting unit goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Description of the Matter                  | Estimating fair values in connection with these impairment evaluations involves the utilization of discounted cash flow models and market multiples valuation approaches. Auditing management's annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units was complex because the estimation of fair values involves subjective management assumptions, such as estimates of the projected rates of discrete and long-term growth of cash flows and weighted average cost of capital. These assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by shifts in the evolving market landscape. Changes in these                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over Company's impairment evaluation processes. Our procedures included testing controls over management's review of the valuation models and the significant assumptions described above. Our audit procedures to test management's impairment evaluations included, among others, assessing the valuation methodologies and significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used to develop such assumptions. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, and other guideline companies in the same industry. Where appropriate, we evaluated whether changes to the Company's business model, customer base and other factors would affect the significant assumptions. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed independent sensitivity analyses. We involved our valuation specialists to assist us in performing our audit procedures to test the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units. |",

      "answer": "In 2023, Arkansas enacted legislation to reduce its corporate income tax rate, resulting in a $114 million reduction in META\u2019s deferred tax expense. This provided a financial benefit by lowering future tax liabilities. However, in 2024, Arkansas implemented youth protection laws that restrict META\u2019s ability to offer services to minors without parental consent, increasing regulatory compliance risks and potential penalties. This shift from tax incentives to stricter regulatory oversight created a dual effect: short-term financial relief through reduced tax obligations, but longer-term operational and legal risks tied to compliance with youth data and safety regulations, which could lead to significant changes in product design and user engagement strategies.",

These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\n\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is ex pected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions.\n\nWe are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data protection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject rights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the  U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties  (including  substantial  monetary  remedies),  interrupt  or  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a  manner  materially  adverse  to  our  business (including  changes  to  our  products  or  user  data  practices),  result  in  negative  publicity  and  reputational  harm,  divert  resources  and  the  time  and  attention  of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.",

      "answer": "In 2022, T announced its intent to adopt ASU 2020-06 for convertible instruments starting with interim reporting, noting that settlement of the Mobility II preferred interests in stock would increase dilutive impact depending on the fair value of the instrument and the average AT&T stock price during the reporting period. ASU 2020-06 eliminated certain separation models and required instruments that may be settled in cash or stock to be presumed settled in stock for diluted EPS calculations. By 2024, T had fully adopted ASU 2020-06 through retrospective application, and specifically referenced that prior to the April 2023 repurchase, the dilutive impact of the Mobility preferred interests continued to vary with stock price and fair value fluctuations. The change in accounting policy from 2022 to 2024 reflects a shift from preparation and evaluation to full implementation, with measurable effects on diluted EPS calculations due to the presumed stock settlement method.",

We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and expenses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3). Operations in countries with highly inflationary economies use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.\n\nWe hedge a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk involved in certain foreign currency-denominated transactions, which we explain further in our discussion of our methods of managing our foreign currency risk (see Note 13).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 15 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\nReference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting' (ASU 2020-04, as amended), which provides optional expedients, and allows for certain exceptions to existing GAAP, for contract modifications triggered by the expected market transition of certain benchmark interest rates to alternative reference rates. ASU 2020-04 applies to contracts, hedging relationships, certain derivatives and other arrangements that reference the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or any other rates ending after December 31, 2022. ASU 2020-04, as amended, became effective immediately. We do not believe our adoption of ASU 2020-04, including optional expedients, will materially impact our financial statements.\n\nConvertible Instruments Beginning with 2022 interim reporting, we will adopt ASU No. 2020-06, 'Debt-Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity' (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 eliminated certain separation models regarding cash conversion and beneficial conversion features to simplify reporting for convertible instruments as a single liability or equity, with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Additionally, ASU 202006 requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock are presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earnings per share. While our intent is to settle the Mobility II preferred interests in cash (see Note 17), settlement of this instrument in AT&amp;T shares will result in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&amp;T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. We are currently evaluating our adoption method and the impact on our financial statements, as our recent decision (February 2022) on methodology of distribution to AT&amp;T's shareholders (i.e., pro rata dividend) for the pending WarnerMedia transaction could affect the impact of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements (see Note 6).\n\nGovernment Assistance In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, 'Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance' (ASU 2021-10), which requires annual disclosures, in the notes to the financial statements, about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other guidance. The annual disclosures include terms and conditions, accounting treatment and impacted financial statement lines reflecting the impact of the transactions. ASU 2021-10 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, under prospective or retrospective application for all in scope government transactions in the financial statements as of our adoption date or thereafter. We are evaluating the disclosure impacts of our adoption of ASU 2021-10.",

The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt -Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\n\nAccordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as follows (in millions):\n\n",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&amp;T Inc. is referred to as 'AT&amp;T,' 'we' or the 'Company.' The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries and affiliates which we control. AT&amp;T is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries.\n\nOn April 8, 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business, which represented substantially all of our WarnerMedia segment, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which Magallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a formerly wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T that held the WarnerMedia business, was distributed to AT&amp;T stockholders via a pro rata dividend, followed by the combination of Spinco with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery), which was renamed Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (WBD). (See Note 6)\n\nUpon the separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations. For discontinued operations, we also evaluated transactions that were components of AT&amp;T's single plan of a strategic shift, including dispositions that previously did not individually meet the criteria due to materiality, and have determined discontinued operations to be comprised of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. (See Notes 6 and 24)\n\nAll significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in subsidiaries and partnerships which we do not control but have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included in our results on a one quarter lag. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees' other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including translation adjustments. We treat distributions received from equity method investees as returns on investment and classify them as cash flows from operating activities until those distributions exceed our cumulative equity in the earnings of that investment. We treat the excess amount as a return of investment and classify it as cash flows from investing activities. In the event we receive dividends in ex cess of the carrying amount of the investment, and we have no obligation to provide financial support to the equity method investee, we treat those dividends as returns on investment and classify them as cash flows from operating activities.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, including other estimates of fair value, probable losses and expenses, that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Moreover, unfavorable changes in market conditions, including interest rates, could adversely impact those estimates and result in asset impairments. Certain prior-period amounts have been conformed to the current period's presentation. Unless otherwise noted, the information in Notes 1 through 23 refer only to our continuing operations and do not include discussion of balances or activity of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic, which are part of discontinued operations.\n\n## Adopted and New Accounting Standards\n\nSegment Reporting In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, 'Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures' (ASU 2023-07). Beginning with our 2024 annual reporting, we adopted, through retrospective application, ASU No. 2023-07, which requires that a public entity disclose, on an interim and annual basis, significant segment expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to its chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss. An entity must also disclose, by reportable segment, the amount and composition of other expenses. The standard requires an entity disclose the title and position of its CODM and explain how the CODM uses these reported measures in assessing segment performance and determining how to allocate resources.\n\nConvertible Instruments Beginning with 2022 interim reporting, we adopted, through retrospective application, ASU No. 2020-06, 'Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity' (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock are presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earnings per share. Prior to the April 2023 repurchase, settlement of our Series A Cumulative Perpetual Membership Interests in AT&amp;T Mobility II LLC (Mobility preferred interests) could have resulted in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which was influenced by the fair value of the Mobility preferred interests and the average AT&amp;T common stock price during the reporting period, which varied from period-to-period (see Note 16).",

In 2024, AT&T disclosed that a major labor contract covering 9,000 employees in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas was set to expire in April 2025, indicating continued operational scale in the state despite earlier regulatory concerns. The deferred tax expense reduction in Arkansas from 2023 legislation ($114M in 2023 and additional $34M in 2024) could have provided some financial flexibility for capital investments, though the company still faced network deployment risks from regulatory hurdles.",

      "question": "How did the shift in GOOGL's share repurchase activity between Class A and Class B common stock from 2022 to 2024 reflect changes in voting rights structure and capital allocation strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL repurchased $59.3 billion of Class A and Class C shares, while in 2024, the company repurchased $62.0 billion of these shares, indicating a growing emphasis on capital return. Class B shares, which carry 10 votes per share compared to Class A's 1 vote, can be converted to Class A shares at any time and automatically upon sale or transfer. The continued repurchase of Class A shares, which have lower voting rights, suggests a shift toward prioritizing capital efficiency over maintaining concentrated voting control, especially as Class B shares are often held by insiders and can convert to Class A. By 2024, $44.7 billion remained available under the new $70.0 billion repurchase authorization, signaling sustained pressure to return capital to shareholders while gradually diluting the influence of high-vote Class B shares.",

      "question": "How did Disney's treatment of equity in earnings from non-guarantor subsidiaries change between 2022 and 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's reliance on subsidiary earnings for debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Disney's treatment of equity in earnings from non-guarantor subsidiaries remained consistent between 2022 and 2024, as both the 2022 and 2024 filings stated that these earnings and investments were eliminated in the summarized financial information for the Obligor Group under SEC Regulation S-X Rule 13-01. This consistent treatment reveals that the company's reliance on subsidiary earnings for servicing its debt obligations remained unchanged, with the Obligor Group's cash flow still dependent on the earnings of subsidiaries being distributed via dividends, loans, or other means. The Obligor Group, comprising TWDC and Legacy Disney, continued to rely on this structure to meet its debt obligations, including public debt, as stated in both filings.",

By 2023, Class B common stock voting rights were reduced to 10 votes per share, aligning more closely with Class A voting rights of one vote per share. This change likely contributed to increased share repurchase activity, as GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, up from $59.3 billion in 2022, potentially reflecting a strategic shift in capital allocation and shareholder structure.",

By 2024, this investment contributed to an 11% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered, with Reels being a key driver of user growth and engagement, especially in the Asia-Pacific and Rest of World regions. However, despite a 10% increase in average price per ad, the growth in ad impressions was partially offset by the lower monetization rates associated with Reels, as noted in the 2024 report.

The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.\n\n## Advertising\n\nAdvertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad. In 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28% increase in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in all regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In 2024, the average price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The increase in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by an increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement tools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled \"-Executive Overview of Full Y ear 2024 Results.\" In addition, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and ad impressions delivered.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nFoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by WhatsApp Business Platform revenue.\n\n## Reality Labs\n\nRL revenue in 2024 increased $250 million, or 13%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to an increase in RL consumer hardware products sold.\n\n## Revenue Seasonality\n\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and 16% between the third and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17% compared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.",

      "question": "How did Disney's 2022 DTC strategy risks evolve into the ESPN+ subscriber growth trajectory seen by 2024, particularly in light of the bundling approach with Disney+ and Hulu?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney expressed significant concerns about the risks to its DTC strategy, including subscriber retention, pricing pressures, and content cost overruns, with particular emphasis on the challenges of attracting and retaining subscribers at scale. By 2024, ESPN+ had reached 26 million paid subscribers in the U.S., achieved in part through a bundling strategy with Disney+ and Hulu, which directly addressed the earlier risks by leveraging cross-promotion and shared customer bases. The bundling model helped mitigate churn and attract subscribers who might not have opted for ESPN+ alone. This evolution shows that Disney managed to navigate the risks outlined in 2022 by integrating ESPN+ into a broader DTC ecosystem, thereby improving its subscriber growth and financial viability despite earlier uncertainties.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nsuccessfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

(2)\n\nESPN+ is a domestic subscription-based DTC service offering thousands of live sporting events, on-demand sports content and other original programming. The service is offered individually or in various bundles with Disney+ and Hulu to customers directly or through third-party distributors on mobile and internet connected devices. ESPN+ revenue is derived from subscription fees, pay-per-view fees and, to a lesser extent, advertising. Live events available through the service include mixed martial arts, soccer, hockey, boxing, baseball, college sports, golf, tennis and cricket. ESPN+ is currently the ex clusive distributor for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) pay-per-view events in the U.S. As of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid ESPN+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 26 million.\n\n## International ESPN\n\nThe Company operates approximately 45 ESPN branded sports channels outside the U.S. in 4 languages and approximately 115 countries/territories. In the Netherlands, the ESPN branded channels are operated by Eredivisie Media &amp; Marketing CV (EMM) (owned 51% by the Company), which has the media and sponsorship rights to the Dutch Premier League for soccer. Rights include various soccer leagues (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues). As of September 2024, the estimated number of subscribers to ESPN branded channels outside the U.S., based on internal management reports, was approximately 55 million.",

      "answer": "Disney increased its notional amount of foreign exchange cash flow hedges from $7.4 billion in 2022 to $9.9 billion in 2024, indicating a more aggressive hedging strategy to protect against foreign currency fluctuations. This increase specifically relates to their firm commitments and forecasted foreign currency transactions, suggesting that the company has expanded its hedging activities to manage a broader or larger volume of such exposures. The growth in hedge notional amounts implies that Disney has either increased its international operations or is facing greater volatility in foreign exchange markets, prompting a stronger risk management posture.",

This non-dilutable voting structure for Class B shares, combined with their convertibility into Class A shares, suggests that any future conversions would likely be strategic decisions by the concentrated holders of Class B stock to either maintain control or gradually shift voting influence to broader ownership through conversion. The fact that Class A Common Stock was registered on Nasdaq in 2023 further supports the infrastructure for such a strategic shift.",

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## NOTE 5. REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nWe report our revenues net of sales taxes and record certain regulatory fees, primarily Universal Service Fund (USF) fees, on a net basis. No customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n\nWireless, Advanced Data, Legacy Voice &amp; Data Services and Equipment Revenue\n\nWe offer service-only contracts and contracts that bundle equipment used to access the services and/or with other service offerings. Some contracts have fixed terms and others are cancelable on a short-term basis (i.e., month-to-month arrangements).\n\nExamples of service revenues include wireless, fiber and other advanced connectivity, transitional and legacy voice and data. These services represent a series of distinct services that is considered a separate performance obligation. Service revenue is recognized when services are provided, based upon either period of time (e.g., monthly service fees) or usage (e.g., bytes of data processed).\n\nSome of our services require customer premises equipment that, when combined and integrated with AT&amp;T's specific network infrastructure, facilitates the delivery of service to the customer. In evaluating whether the equipment is a separate performance obligation, we consider the customer's ability to benefit from the equipment on its own or together with other readily available resources and if so, whether the service and equipment are separately identifiable (i.e., is the service highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with the equipment). When equipment is a separate performance obligation, we record the sale of equipment when title has passed and the products are accepted by the customer. For devices sold through indirect channels (e.g., national retailers), revenue is recognized when the retailer accepts the device, not upon activation.\n\nOur equipment and service revenues are predominantly recognized on a gross basis, as most of our services do not involve a third party and we typically control the equipment that is sold to our customers.\n\nRevenue recognized from fixed-term contracts that bundle services and/or equipment is allocated based on the standalone selling price of all required performance obligations of the contract (i.e., each item included in the bundle). Promotional discounts are attributed to each required component of the arrangement, resulting in recognition over the contract term. Standalone selling prices are determined by assessing prices paid for service-only contracts (e.g., arrangements where customers bring their own devices) and standalone device pricing.\n\nWe offer the majority of our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a specified period of time, and, in many cases, they may be eligible to trade in the original equipment for a new device and have the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled. For customers that elect these equipment installment payment programs, at the point of sale, we recognize revenue for the entire amount of revenue allocated to the customer receivable net of fair value of the trade-in right guarantee, when applicable. The difference between the revenue recognized and the consideration received is recorded as a note receivable when the devices are not discounted and our right to consideration is unconditional. When installment sales include promotional discounts that are earned by customers over the contract term (e.g., 'buy one get one free' or equipment discounts with trade-in of a device), notes receivable are recognized net of discounts and the difference between revenue recognized and consideration received is recorded as a contract asset to be amortized over the contract term.\n\nLess commonly, we offer certain customers highly discounted devices when they enter into a minimum service agreement term. For these contracts, we recognize equipment revenue at the point of sale based on a standalone selling price allocation. The difference between the revenue recognized and the cash received is recorded as a contract asset that will amortize over the contract term.\n\nOur contracts allow for customers to frequently modify their arrangement, without incurring penalties in many cases. When a contract is modified, we evaluate the change in scope or price of the contract to determine if the modification should be treated as a new contract or if it should be considered a change of the existing contract. We generally do not have significant impacts from contract modifications.\n\nRevenues from transactions between us and our customers are recorded net of revenue-based regulatory fees and taxes. Cash incentives given to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Nonrefundable, upfront service activation and setup fees associated with service arrangements are deferred and recognized over the associated service contract period or customer relationship life.",

      "answer": "In 2023, holders of META's Class A common stock held approximately 66.67% of the combined voting power, while the Class B common stock, which is non-dilutable and controlled by a small group of stockholders (23 as of December 31, 2023), held the remaining 33.33%. By 2024, the total shares of Class A common stock outstanding were 2,189,898,148, with Class B common stock at 343,761,117, maintaining the same 15:1 voting power ratio per share between Class B and Class A. This structure continued to concentrate significant control with Class B holders, despite the broader ownership base of Class A shares.

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock in CMCSA change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this imply about the company's ownership structure stability given that Mr. Brian L. Roberts still holds all Class B shares?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Class A common stockholders held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3%. This distribution remained consistent in 2023, as CMCSA's 2023 filing confirms that Class A stockholders retained 66 2/3% of the voting power, and Class B stockholders maintained 33 1/3%. Despite the non-dilutable nature of Class B stock, the total issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock decreased from 5,083,466,045 in 2022 to 4,842,108,959 in 2023, while Class B shares remained unchanged at 9,444,375. This suggests that the ownership structure remained stable, with Mr. Brian L. Roberts continuing to hold all Class B shares, preserving his concentrated voting power.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: CMCSA disclosed that Class A stockholders held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power in 2022.",

      "question": "How did Disney's financial exposure to brand integration risks involving Pixar content evolve from 2022 to 2023, given the company's DTC strategy adjustments and the classification of Pixar trademarks as indefinite-lived intangible assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney acknowledged significant risks associated with brand integration, noting that combining previously separate brands or products could lead to adverse brand impacts if not accepted by consumers, which directly affected their DTC strategy's success. The Disney+ interface explicitly included Pixar-branded programming as a top-level tile, increasing the visibility and integration of Pixar content within Disney\u2019s streaming platform. By 2023, the company classified Pixar trademarks as indefinite-lived intangible assets, signaling a long-term strategic commitment to maintaining and leveraging the Pixar brand. This evolution suggests that while brand integration risks remained, Disney placed greater financial value on the Pixar brand within its DTC ecosystem, potentially increasing both the strategic importance and financial exposure tied to Pixar content between 2022 and 2023.",

As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T had the discretion to fund certain postretirement benefits from its cash accounts, which did not reduce VEBA Trust assets. This flexibility likely allowed AT&T to preserve VEBA Trust balances while still meeting benefit obligations. By 2024, the Pension Trust and VEBA Trust were commingled in a single investment vehicle, with the Pension Trust holding 98.0% of the assets, indicating a significant shift in the relative funding burden toward the Pension Trust.

      "answer": "In 2022, Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3% of the voting power with each share entitled to 15 votes, while Class A stockholders held 66 2/3% of the voting power. By 2024, Class B shares were automatically convertible to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, with each Class B share carrying 10 votes prior to conversion. This shift in voting rights structure, combined with the company's $62.0 billion share repurchase program in 2024 (targeting both Class A and Class C shares), suggests a strategic alignment to maintain voting control while reducing overall share count. The conversion mechanism facilitated consolidation of voting power into Class A shares through natural transfers, complementing the repurchase strategy.",

We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees' contributions up to certain limits. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, expenses related to these plans totaled $595 million, $599 million and $573 million, respectively.\n\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We also participate in other multiemployer benefit plans that  provide health and welfare and retirement savings benefits to active and retired participants.

Each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to 15 votes. The number of votes held by each share of our Class A common stock depends on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding at any given time.

Shares of Class B common stock may be conv erted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically conv ert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prev ailing market conditions, including the relativ e trading prices and v olumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and $62.0 billion, respectiv ely, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\n\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained av ailable for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\n\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did the proportional allocation of undistributed earnings between Class B and Class C stock evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this reveal about the consistency of GOOGL's dividend policy across share classes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL's undistributed earnings were allocated proportionately across Class A, Class B, and Class C stock based on contractual participation rights, as all classes were entitled to equal per-share dividends or distributions in liquidation. This pattern remained unchanged in 2023, with the company continuing to allocate undistributed earnings on a proportionate basis due to identical dividend and liquidation rights across all classes. The continued alignment in net income per share amounts for Class B and Class C stock in both years reflects a stable dividend policy, despite the structural differences in voting rights. This consistency is reinforced by Delaware law and the company's certificate of incorporation, which prevent unequal per-share dividends without class-specific approval.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIf approval is obtained, each of the Company's stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 (the 'Record Date'), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of the same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.\n\n## Note 12. Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\n\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical,  except  with  respect  to  voting.  Furthermore,  there  are  a  number  of  safeguards  built  into  our  certificate  of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends  on  our  Class  A,  Class  B,  and  Class  C  stock.  Specifically,  Delaware  law  provides  that  amendments  to  our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that  before  any  such  amendment  may  be  put  to  a  stockholder  vote,  it  must  be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\n\n",

By 2024, these investments had led to increased exposure to AI-related regulatory frameworks, both in the U.S. and internationally, which directly contributed to higher compliance costs and greater legal risk (META_10k_2024.pdf, p.27). Additionally, Goldman Sachs\u2019 2024 filing highlights that the uncertain and rapidly evolving regulatory environment around AI models\u2014especially generative AI\u2014required firms to make significant adjustments to implementation strategies, increasing both compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance (GS_10k_2024.pdf, p.46).

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock at CMCSA change from 2023 to 2024, and what implications does the fixed convertibility of Class B shares into Class A shares have on shareholder control?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA disclosed that holders of Class A common stock had 66 2/3% of the voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3%. By 2024, the structure remained intact, with Class A still holding 66 2/3% and Class B maintaining 33 1/3% of voting power. This stability was preserved despite the fact that Class B shares are convertible, share for share, into Class A shares. The 2024 filing clarified that the 33 1/3% aggregate voting power of Class B common stock cannot be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of common stock, ensuring that the relative control balance remains fixed even if conversions occur. This suggests a deliberate governance strategy to maintain long-term control dynamics.",

      "question": "How did the structural relationship between GOOGL's Class A and Class B common stock voting rights influence the company's share repurchase strategy in 2024, compared to 2023, given the automatic conversion of Class B shares upon transfer?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, while in 2024, it repurchased $62.0 billion of the same classes. The share structure shows that Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon transfer, giving Class A holders 1 vote per share and Class B holders 10 votes per share. Despite the significant voting power tied to Class B shares, the company's sustained repurchase activity focused on Class A and C shares, likely to consolidate equity without directly impacting the high-vote Class B structure. This suggests a strategy to maintain the current voting balance while reducing overall share count.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL disclosed that Class B common stockholders had limited voting rights, including on certain defined matters such as exiting the core payments business, mergers, or amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation. By 2023, these voting rights remained largely unchanged, with Class B stockholders continuing to vote only on those defined matters, often as a separate class. Meanwhile, the Certificate of Incorporation, as referenced in 2023, included safeguards that required any amendment adversely altering the rights of a stock class to be approved by the affected class, and further required unanimous board approval before such amendments could be put to a stockholder vote. These provisions ensured that all stock classes\u2014A, B, and C\u2014continued to receive equal per-share dividends or distributions in liquidation, as confirmed by the consistent net income per share across all classes for the years 2021 through 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, and in 2024, it repurchased $62.0 billion, indicating a consistent but slightly reduced level of buybacks. The Certificate of Incorporation governed how these repurchases were conducted, ensuring that shares were repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and stockholders, taking into account economic cost and market conditions, including relative trading prices and volumes of both classes. Despite differing voting rights\u2014Class A shares have one vote per share while Class C shares have no voting rights except as required by law\u2014the Certificate of Incorporation required that repurchases be conducted without unequal economic treatment, ensuring both classes were handled proportionately. This governance framework allowed GOOGL to continue prioritizing repurchases based on market conditions rather than structural preferences, maintaining consistency in capital allocation strategy across both years.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL(2023) \u2192 Certificate of Incorporation: The 2023 repurchase program was executed under provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation that governed how shares could be repurchased, ensuring fairness across share classes.",
        "Hop 2: Certificate of Incorporation \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The Certificate outlined the rights of Class A and Class C shares, ensuring equal economic treatment despite differing voting rights, which directly influenced repurchase decisions.",

Stockholders' Equity\n\n## Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\n\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to v oting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share.  Each share of  Class  B common stock is entitled to 10  v otes  per  share.  Class  C  capital  stock  has no  v oting  rights,  except  as required by applicable law . Shares of Class B common stock may be conv erted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically conv ert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prev ailing market conditions, including the relativ e trading prices and v olumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and $62.0 billion, respectiv ely, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\n\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained av ailable for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\n\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock in 2023 evolve by 2024, and what implications did this have for shareholder control and equity structure at CMCSA?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Class B common stock was disclosed as having 15 votes per share and representing 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, while Class A common stock collectively held 66 2/3% of the voting power. By 2024, despite no change in the voting structure, the number of issued Class A shares decreased from 4,842,108,959 in 2023 to 4,651,093,045 in 2024, while the Class B shares remained constant at 9,444,375. This reduction in Class A shares, combined with the non-dilutable voting power of Class B shares, likely concentrated control further in the hands of the Class B shareholders, such as Brian L. Roberts, despite overall equity increasing from $82,703 million in 2023 to $85,560 million in 2024.",

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class  B  common stock having 15 votes per share.  The  Class  B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\n## Div idends\n\nWe expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

      "question": "How did the conversion mechanism from Class B to Class A Common Stock influence the changes in voting power distribution and shareholder equity structure between 2022 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA disclosed that holders of Class A common stock had 66 2/3% of the voting power, while holders of Class B common stock held 33 1/3% of the voting power, with each share of Class B common stock entitled to 15 votes. Additionally, Class B shares were convertible, share for share, into Class A common stock. By 2024, Class B common stock was no longer listed as an issued or outstanding class, suggesting that conversions may have occurred, shifting voting power further to Class A shareholders. The shareholder equity section in 2024 showed that 4,651,093,045 shares of Class A common stock were issued, with retained earnings increasing to $56,972 million from $52,892 million in 2023. This indicates that the conversion mechanism likely contributed to a consolidation of voting power in Class A shares and impacted the overall equity structure over time.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe maintain unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plans for certain members of management and nonemployee directors. The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate. Participants are eligible to receive distributions from their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.\n\nWe have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, net, was $549 million and $481 million, respectively.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nWe sponsor  several  401(k)  defined  contribution  retirement  plans  that  allow  eligible  employees  to  contribute  a  portion  of  their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines. We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees' contributions up to certain limits. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, expenses related to these plans totaled $595 million, $599 million and $573 million, respectively.\n\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We also participate in other multiemployer benefit plans that  provide health and welfare and retirement savings benefits to active and retired participants. If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or were to otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law would require us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by other participating  employers  may  lead  to  adverse  changes  in  the  financial  condition  of  one  of  these  plans,  which  could  result  in  an increase  in  our  withdrawal  liability.  Total  contributions  we  made  to  multiemployer  benefit  plans  and  any  potential  withdrawal liabilities were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Note 12: Equity\n\n## Common Stock\n\nIn the aggregate, holders of our Class A common stock have 66 /3% of the voting power of our common stock and holders of our Class B common stock have 33 /3% of the voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to 15 votes. The number of votes held by each share of our Class A common stock depends on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding at any given time. The 33 /3% aggregate voting power of our Class B common stock cannot be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of common stock. Our Class B common stock is convertible, share for share, into Class A common stock, subject to certain restrictions. 2 1 1\n\n## Shares of Common Stock Outstanding\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA had 4,842,108,959 issued Class A common stock shares, which decreased to 4,651,093,045 in 2024, a reduction of 191,015,914 shares. Despite this decrease, the voting power held by Class A shares remained at 66 2/3% due to the fixed 15-vote per share structure of Class B common stock, which represented 33 1/3% of the combined voting power and was non-dilutable. This dynamic ensured that even with fewer Class A shares outstanding, the proportional voting control between the two classes remained unchanged, with Mr. Brian L. Roberts maintaining full ownership of the Class B shares.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA disclosed the presence of Class B common stock with 9,444,375 shares outstanding, each carrying 15 votes and representing 33 1/3% of combined voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The relationship between the two classes is defined by a formula where the number of votes per Class A share depends on the total shares of both classes, with Class B shares having 15 votes each and Class A shares having a variable number of votes.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(2024): CMCSA disclosed that the number of issued Class A shares decreased from 4,842,108,959 in 2023 to 4,651,093,045 in 2024, while maintaining the same par value and voting power allocation."

      "answer": "In 2022, Marvel was listed as an indefinite-lived intangible asset under DIS's brand portfolio, which included trademarks critical to its content strategy. The Disney+ service, which explicitly includes Marvel-branded programming as top-level tiles in its interface, saw a 10% increase in effective rates in 2024 due to retail pricing increases. This suggests that DIS leveraged its Marvel content\u2014valued as a long-term brand asset\u2014to support pricing power in its subscription model, contributing to the effective rate growth in Disney+ fees.",

The increase in impressions was due to Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar growth, in part reflecting the launches of the ad-supported Disney+ service domestically in December 2022 and internationally starting in November 2023 and airing more cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar. There were two significant International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year.\n\n## Revenues - Other\n\nThe increase in other revenue was due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nIn addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business: (1)\n\nPaid subscribers at:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney highlighted that Val d'Europe included hotels operated by third parties on land leased or purchased from the company, contributing to a capital-efficient model. The development included 5,750 resort hotel rooms operated by third parties at Disneyland Paris. In 2024, Disney emphasized a strategy of investing in hotels while managing risks related to capital outlays, especially in international markets. This suggests that the success of the Val d'Europe model, where third-party operators manage hotel assets, influenced Disney\u2019s broader hotel investment strategy to focus on partnerships that reduce direct capital commitments while expanding room capacity across its global resorts.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## We face risks relating to misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products, which impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and the profitability of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently produce compelling creative content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through DTC platforms, broadcast, cable, theaters and used in theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences. Demand for certain out-of-home entertainment experiences, such as theater-going to watch movies, has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, many of our businesses depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S. The success of our businesses therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to continually evolving consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often make substantial investments in content production and acquisition, acquisition of sports and programming rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other facilities or customer facing platforms before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance, and the market, economic or social conditions are sometimes significantly different from the ones we anticipated at the time of the investment decisions. Further, preferences of some consumers are affected by their perceptions of our position on matters of public interest, including regarding environmental and social issues. Generally, revenues from, and profitability of, each of our businesses are adversely impacted when our entertainment offerings and products, as well as our methods to make our offerings and products available to consumers, do not align with constantly evolving consumer preferences and tastes or achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\n## A variety of uncontrollable events disrupt our businesses, reduce demand for or consumption of our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost or reduce the profitability of providing our products and services.\n\nThe operation and profitability of our businesses and demand for and consumption of our products and services, particularly our parks and experiences businesses, are highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, including in the specific regions in which our parks and experiences businesses operate. In addition, we have extensive international operations, including our international theme parks and resorts, which are dependent on domestic and international regulations consistent with trade and investment in those regions. The operation of our businesses and the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for and consumption of our other entertainment products, is subject to significant adverse impact in the U.S., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: health concerns; adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term climate change, including longer and more regular excessive heat conditions, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, droughts, tsunamis and earthquakes); international, political or military developments, including trade and other international disputes and social unrest; macroeconomic conditions, including a decline in economic activity, inflation and foreign exchange rates; and terrorist attacks. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs, supply chain disruptions and malware and other cyber-related attacks or intrusions or other widespread computing, telecommunications or payment processing failures, from time to time have disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our ability to provide our products and services or in certain instances may affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage with respect to some of these events. An incident or other event that affected our property directly, including a security incident, earthquake or hurricane, would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could result in closure of impacted operations or have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities. Moreover, the costs of protecting against such incidents reduces the profitability of our operations.\n\nFor example, COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our businesses in a number of ways, including the closure of our theme parks and resorts, suspension of cruise ship sailings and guided tours, delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled, theatrical releases and disruptions in the production and availability of content, significantly reducing revenues across all of our segments. Certain of our business operations have been temporarily disrupted by payment processing outages and widespread computing failures. Hurricanes, such as Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which in the case of Hurricane Milton caused Walt Disney World Resort theme parks in Florida to close for one full and partial day, have impacted the operations and profitability of Walt Disney World Resort and may do so in the future. The Company has paused certain operations in certain regions, including in response to sanctions, trade restrictions and related developments and the profitability of certain operations has been impacted as a result of events in the corresponding regions.\n\nIn addition, we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming, sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties, and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. The profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely impacted by the significant contraction of distribution channels for our products and services,",

      "question": "How did the evolution of T's relationship with Crown Castle through the wireless tower transaction from 2022 to 2024 impact the financing obligation and depreciation expense associated with the tower assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, T's relationship with the wireless towers depended on Crown Castle, which had exclusive rights to lease and operate 9,048 towers and purchased 627 towers for $4,827 in cash. T subleased space on these towers for an initial term of ten years. By 2024, T continued to sublease tower space, but the original term was extended to an estimated 20 years, with optional renewals. Crown Castle retained operational control, and T accounted for the transaction as a financing obligation at an effective interest rate of approximately 3.9%. The financing obligation was adjusted by interest expense and net cash flows retained by Crown Castle, and reduced by T's contractual payments. The tower assets remained on T's balance sheet under 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net,' with depreciation continuing annually. At the end of 2024, the tower asset balance was $608, down from $647 in 2023, with a consistent depreciation expense of $39 for both 2024 and 2023. This shows that while the depreciation expense remained stable, the financing obligation evolved due to interest and payment dynamics.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney disclosed that its VAR model included foreign exchange derivatives as part of its broader hedging strategy to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of foreign currency exposures, with a VAR estimate of $395 million. By 2023, the VAR estimate had decreased to $255 million, attributed to reduced interest rate volatility. While the company continued to use foreign exchange derivatives within the VAR model, the decline in the VAR amount suggests a recalibration of risk exposure, potentially influenced by both changes in market conditions and adjustments to the composition or weighting of derivatives within the variance/co-variance model.

By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.\n\nIt is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.\n\n## Value at Risk (VAR)\n\nThe Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis increased to $395 million at October 1, 2022 from $364 million at October 2, 2021.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

By 2023, the VAR model disclosed that forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and foreign currency-denominated accounts receivable/payable were explicitly excluded from the VAR model's calculations. This exclusion, combined with the increase in hedge notional amounts, suggests that Disney shifted toward a more proactive hedging strategy for firm commitments, reducing reliance on VAR modeling for these exposures.

The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes, enabling management to focus on core business issues and challenges.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $7.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions.

      "answer": "The reduction of 191,015,914 issued Class A Common Stock shares between 2023 and 2024 altered CMCSA's capital structure and potentially shifted governance dynamics. While Class A common stockholders maintain full voting rights, Class B common stockholders only have voting rights in specific circumstances like mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation, where they vote together as a single class with votes proportional to their shares multiplied by the conversion rate. With fewer Class A shares outstanding (3,778,302,017 in 2024 vs. 3,969,317,931 in 2023), the relative influence of Class B shareholders may have increased in those limited voting scenarios, despite remaining a small total share class (9,444,375 shares) compared to Class A.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T's pension trust held $5,562 in preferred equity interests in Mobility II, with AT&T securities representing 11% of total pension trust assets. By 2024, these assets were commingled into a unified trust where postretirement benefit plans, managed through the VEBA Trust, held only a 2.0% allocable interest. This restructuring shifted the funding dynamics, as postretirement benefits could now be paid either directly from AT&T's cash accounts without affecting VEBA assets or from the VEBA Trust itself, which would reduce its asset balances. The reduction in AT&T securities from 11% in 2022 to 2.0% in 2024 within the broader trust framework indicates a strategic reallocation that likely increased the dependency on the VEBA Trust's remaining diversified assets for long-term postretirement benefit funding.",

During 2020, the trust sold a portion of these preferred interests valued at $2,885 to third party investors. The preferred equity interests were valued at $5,771 as of December 31, 2020.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, AT&amp;T securities represented 11% of assets held by our pension trust, including the preferred interests in Mobility II. The VEBA trusts included in these financial statements no longer hold AT&amp;T securities.\n\n## Investment Valuation\n\nInvestments are stated at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date.\n\nInvestments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at the last reported sales price on the final business day of the year. If no sale was reported on that date, they are valued at the last reported bid price. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Shares of registered investment companies are valued based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held at year-end.\n\nOther commingled investment entities are valued at quoted redemption values that represent the net asset values of units held at year-end which management has determined approximates fair value.\n\nReal estate and natural resource direct investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports. Fixed income securities valuation is based upon observable prices for comparable assets, broker/dealer quotes (spreads or prices), or a pricing matrix that derives spreads for each bond based on external market data, including the current credit rating for the bonds, credit spreads to Treasuries for each credit rating, sector add-ons or credits, issue-specific add-ons or credits as well as call or other options.\n\nThe preferred interests in Mobility II are valued by an independent fiduciary using an income approach.\n\nPurchases and sales of securities are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are determined on the basis of average cost. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date.\n\nNon-interest bearing cash and overdrafts are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nSee Note 13 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.",

This pattern reflects an evolving capital allocation strategy that may have accounted for the automatic conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares upon sale or transfer, a dynamic that could affect voting control and stockholder equity structure.

Each share of  Class  B common stock is entitled to 10  v otes  per  share.  Class  C  capital  stock  has no  v oting  rights,  except  as required by applicable law . Shares of Class B common stock may be conv erted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically conv ert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prev ailing market conditions, including the relativ e trading prices and v olumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and $62.0 billion, respectiv ely, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\n\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained av ailable for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\n\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did the conversion dynamics between CMCSA's Class A and Class B common stock evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of outstanding shares and their implications on equity structure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA disclosed its Class A Common Stock with 4,842,108,959 shares issued and outstanding, while in 2024, this number slightly decreased to 4,651,093,045 shares. Class B Common Stock, which converts on a one-for-one basis into Class A Common Stock, was disclosed in 2024 with 9,444,375 shares issued and outstanding. The conversion mechanism described in 2023 restricts Class B holders from retaining Class A shares, requiring subsequent transfers. In 2024, the equity section of CMCSA's 10-K shows that Class B Common Stock had a par value of $0.01, with no issued shares in 2023 and 9,444,375 shares in 2024. This indicates a new issuance of Class B shares in 2024, which could signal a strategic shift in capital structure or shareholder base, while maintaining the one-for-one conversion policy.",

      "question": "How did the conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock between 2023 and 2024 impact CMCSA's overall capital structure and shareholder equity, particularly in terms of voting power distribution and retained earnings growth?",
      "answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, CMCSA maintained a dual-class equity structure where Class B common stock was convertible share-for-share into Class A common stock. In 2023, Class B shares (9,444,375 issued and outstanding) carried 15 votes per share, contributing to a 33 1/3% aggregate voting power for Class B shareholders. By 2024, the number of Class B shares remained unchanged, preserving their voting influence. However, Class A shares issued increased from 4,842,108,959 in 2023 to 4,651,093,045 in 2024 (a decrease of ~191 million shares), while outstanding shares dropped from 3,969,317,931 to 3,778,302,017. This suggests conversions may have occurred, shifting voting power dynamics slightly as Class B shares converted to Class A. Retained earnings grew significantly from $52,892 million in 2023 to $56,972 million in 2024, indicating improved profitability or reinvestment strategy. The capital structure evolved with a slight increase in total equity from $83,226 million to $86,038 million, reflecting strategic decisions to support retained earnings growth while managing the dual-class share structure.",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stockholders in 2022 compare to 2024, and what implications did this have for shareholder influence and corporate governance at CMCSA?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Class A common stockholders held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3%, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes and owned entirely by Brian L. Roberts. In 2024, this structure remained unchanged in terms of voting percentages and per-share voting rights. However, the number of issued Class A shares decreased from 4,842,108,959 in 2023 to 4,651,093,045 in 2024, indicating share repurchases that may have consolidated voting influence among remaining shareholders. This reduction in Class A shares, while maintaining the same voting power percentage, could have increased the relative influence of Class B shares held by Roberts, especially as the total number of outstanding shares declined. The unchanged structure suggests a consistent governance strategy favoring long-term control, despite fluctuations in equity composition and treasury stock levels.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: In 2022, Class A shareholders held 66 2/3% of voting power, with Class B at 33 1/3%.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Each Class B share had 15 votes, and all were owned by Brian L. Roberts, creating a concentrated control mechanism.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(2024): In 2024, the voting structure remained the same, but the number of issued Class A shares dropped from 4,842,108,959 to 4,651,093,045, indicating repurchases that could shift influence dynamics."

      "answer": "In 2022, holders of Class A common stock held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock, which had 15 votes per share, represented 33 1/3% of the voting power. By 2024, the voting rights for Class B common stock were adjusted to 10 votes per share, while Class A remained at 1 vote per share. This reduction in Class B voting power from 15 to 10 votes per share indicates a shift in the balance of control, potentially increasing the influence of broader stockholder groups over corporate decisions. This evolution in the Class A and Class B stock structure reflects a strategic move in corporate governance, possibly in response to investor pressure or regulatory considerations.",

By 2023, Class A shares decreased significantly to 3,969 million, while Class B shares remained unchanged at 9 billion, despite additional stock compensation and employee purchase plan activity. The lack of conversion activity between Class B and Class A shares, despite the significant reduction in Class A shares through repurchases and retirements, suggests either a strategic decision to maintain Class B share stability or a lack of incentive for Class A shareholders to convert. This pattern implies a possible corporate focus on maintaining voting structure or investor preference for liquidity in Class B shares.",

      "answer": "In Disney's 2023 reporting, ESPN2 was listed among the significant domestic branded channels under the Sports segment, indicating it was a core channel with comparable importance to ESPN. By 2024, subscriber data showed ESPN2 and ESPNEWS were grouped differently in the subscriber table: ESPN2 remained in the primary tier with 66 million subscribers, while ESPNEWS was categorized separately with only 40 million subscribers. This reveals that ESPN2 maintained its position as a flagship channel, whereas ESPNEWS was positioned as a secondary offering with a smaller subscriber base, highlighting a clearer tiered structure in Disney's sports channel portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Telco Preferred Interests had an initial distribution rate of 4.25% annually, with a reset every seven years starting from the issuance date (September 2020). Holders had the option to require redemption upon contingent events such as failure to pay distributions for two or more periods or failure to meet a minimum credit rating. In 2023, the distribution rate was updated to 6.85% annually, with the first reset scheduled for November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. The redemption terms remained largely consistent, but the increase in the distribution rate suggests a recalibration of financing costs to align with market conditions or credit profile changes. This evolution indicates that AT&T adjusted its preferred equity terms to maintain capital flexibility while managing its telecommunications asset portfolio.",

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nAuthorized Shares We have authorized 14 billion common shares of AT&amp;T stock and 10 million preferred shares of AT&amp;T stock, each with a par value of $1.00 per share. Cumulative perpetual preferred shares consist of the following:\n\n- Series A: 48 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference and a dividend rate of 5.000%.\n- Series B: 20 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a \u20ac100,000 per share liquidation preference, and an initial rate of 2.875%, subject to reset after May 1, 2025.\n- Series C: 70 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference, and a dividend rate of 4.75%.\n\nSo long as the quarterly preferred dividends are declared and paid on a timely basis on each series of preferred shares, there are no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T common shares. The preferred shares are optionally redeemable by AT&amp;T at the liquidation price on or after five years from the issuance date, or upon certain other contingent events.\n\nStock Repurchase Program From time to time, we repurchase shares of common stock for distribution through our employee benefit plans or in connection with certain acquisitions. Our Board of Directors has approved the following authorization to repurchase common stock: (1) March 2013 authorization program of 300 million shares, which was completed in 2020 and (2) March 2014 authorization program for 300 million shares, with approximately 178 million outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n\nTo implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 142 million shares totaling $5,278 under the March 2013 and March 2014 authorizations. During 2021, there were no shares repurchased under the March 2014 authorization.\n\nDividend Declarations In December 2021 and December 2020, AT&amp;T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $36 and a quarterly common dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock.\n\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries We have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration. The preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Mobility II\n\nWe previously issued 320 million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), representing all currently outstanding Mobility preferred equity interests, which pay cash distributions of $560 per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions are declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred equity interests will not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares.\n\nA holder of the Mobility preferred interests may put the interests to Mobility II. Mobility II may redeem the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022. When either option arises due to a passage of time, that option may be exercised only during certain periods.\n\nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) twenty-five dollars ($8,000 in the aggregate) plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price may be paid with cash, AT&amp;T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&amp;T common stock, at Mobility II's sole election. In no event shall Mobility II be required to deliver more than 250 million shares of AT&amp;T common stock to settle put and redemption options. We have the intent and ability to settle the Mobility preferred equity interests with cash.\n\n## Tower Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.",

If notice is given, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of members' equity are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## PR Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $1,950 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a subsidiary (PR Holdings) that held notes secured by the proceeds from our agreement to sell wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These preferred interests were redeemed on November 6, 2020. (See Note 6)\n\nThe membership interests in PR Holdings consisted of (1) common interests, which were held by consolidated subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (PR preferred interests). The PR preferred interests paid an initial preferred distribution at an annual rate of 4.75%. Distributions were paid quarterly, subject to declaration.\n\n## NOTE 18. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and a deferred purchase price, and (2) revolving service and trade receivables. Under these programs, we transfer receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, where applicable. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to 'Total Assets' reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash receipts on the deferred purchase price are classified as cash flows from investing activities.",

      "question": "How did AT&T's 2023 flexibility in funding postretirement benefits from cash accounts, rather than the VEBA Trust, influence the allocation of assets between the VEBA Trust and Pension Trust in 2024, particularly in light of the 98.0% pension plan interest in the commingled trust?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T had the discretion to fund certain postretirement benefits from its cash accounts, which did not reduce VEBA Trust assets. This flexibility likely contributed to maintaining higher VEBA Trust balances during that year. By 2024, the pension and postretirement benefit plans were commingled in one trust, with the pension plan holding 98.0% of the interest. This indicates a shift in asset allocation strategy, where the Pension Trust became the dominant vehicle, possibly due to increased pension obligations or strategic reallocation, while the VEBA Trust's role was reduced. This evolution suggests that AT&T may have prioritized pension funding over postretirement benefits in 2024, leveraging the earlier stability in the VEBA Trust to rebalance the overall retirement benefit structure.",

By 2024, META had 2,189,898,148 shares of Class A common stock and 343,761,117 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, which shifted the practical voting influence due to the significant difference in the number of shares outstanding between the two classes.

      "question": "How did AT&T's 2023 use of the VEBA Trust for postretirement benefit payments influence the allocation of assets in the combined pension and postretirement benefit trust by 2024, and what does this imply about the company's long-term retirement funding strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T indicated that postretirement benefits could be paid from its cash accounts without reducing VEBA Trust assets, or alternatively, future benefit payments may come directly from the VEBA Trust, reducing its balances. By 2024, the pension and postretirement benefit plans were shown to be commingled in a single trust, with the postretirement benefit plan (including the VEBA Trust) holding only 2.0% of the trust's assets, compared to 98.0% allocated to the pension plan. Additionally, AT&T securities represented less than 1% of the pension trust's assets in 2024, indicating a strategic de-emphasis on company stock in retirement funding. This shift suggests a broader reallocation of retirement liabilities toward the pension trust, potentially reducing reliance on the VEBA Trust for postretirement benefits over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: T(2023) \u2192 VEBA Trust: AT&T stated that postretirement benefits could be paid from either company cash (not affecting VEBA assets) or from the VEBA Trust, which would reduce its asset balances.",
        "Hop 2: VEBA Trust \u2192 Pension Trust: The U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans were commingled in one trust, with the postretirement plan (VEBA Trust) holding only 2.0% of the trust\u2019s assets at the end of 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Pension Trust \u2190 T(2024): By 2024, AT&T securities represented less than 1% of the pension trust\u2019s assets, and the VEBA Trust held no AT&T securities, indicating a continued strategic shift away from company stock and toward broader diversification in retirement funding."

The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the governance risks associated with META's Class A Common Stock in 2023 relate to the voting power structure between Class A and Class B Common Stock, and how did this dynamic appear to evolve in META's 2024 disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2023, META's Class A Common Stock was negatively impacted by the company's controlled company status, which limited investor protections and potentially harmed stock price due to the dominance of Class B shareholders, who held 66\u2154% of the combined voting power. The dual-class structure gave Class B shares 15 votes per share, reinforcing the influence of the controlling stockholder. In 2024, META's disclosures reaffirmed this structure, with 343,761,117 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, maintaining the non-dilutive 66\u2154% / 33\u2153% voting power split. Despite the potential for investor concern, the continued emphasis on this governance model suggests a stable strategic posture, with no indication of structural changes that would alleviate the earlier-mentioned risks to Class A shareholders.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, with $36.3 billion remaining available for future repurchases as of December 31, 2023. In 2024, the company continued this trend by repurchasing $62.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares, increasing the remaining availability to $44.7 billion by year-end. The consistent focus on repurchasing Class A and Class C shares, despite the automatic conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares upon sale or transfer, suggests a strategic preference to consolidate voting power within Class A while maintaining liquidity and capital efficiency.

The CSA  agreements contain fixed cap amounts or rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds or caps and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. A t both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not hold any collateral. A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, we posted $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively , of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheets. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.\n\n## Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation\n\n## Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn M ay 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated the Company's authority to grant new awards under the V eriz on 2009 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, we reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, 50 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\n\n## Restricted Stock Units\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of  V erizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. In 2020, V erizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability  is measured at its fair v alue at the end of each reporting period. A ll RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.\n\nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\n## Performance Stock Units\n\nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. A s defined by the 2017 Plan,  the  Human  Resources  Committee of the  Board of  Directors  determines  the  number  of  PSUs  a  participant  earns  based  on  the  extent  to  which  the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of V erizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period.

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA disclosed that Class B Common Stock had only 3 record holders and carried limited voting rights for specific matters like mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation. By 2024, Class B common stock was no longer listed in the equity disclosures, indicating its elimination. This change, combined with the fact that Class A common stockholders retained full voting rights on all matters, suggests a shift toward more centralized governance. The voting rights framework from the 2024 filing emphasized that Class A shareholders would now hold exclusive voting power on most corporate decisions, effectively concentrating decision-making authority within fewer hands. This structural change likely increased the influence of broader shareholder bases represented by Class A shares while removing the special voting provisions previously tied to Class B shares.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META disclosed that its dual-class structure, where Class B common stock controlled key governance decisions, contributed to its status as a 'controlled company' under Nasdaq rules. This allowed the company to bypass certain corporate governance requirements and potentially made Class A common stock less attractive to investors due to reduced shareholder protections. The 2024 voting rights evidence confirmed that Class A common stockholders retained full voting rights, while Class B common stockholders had limited but decisive voting power on specific matters such as mergers and charter amendments. As of January 2025, META still had 343,761,117 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, maintaining the dual-class structure. This persistence indicates that the corporate governance risks identified in 2023\u2014such as concentrated control and limited investor protections\u2014remained unchanged in 2024, continuing to pose potential concerns for Class A shareholders.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T adopted ASU 2020-06, which changed the accounting treatment for convertible instruments like the Mobility preferred interests. Under ASU 2020-06, instruments that may be settled in cash or stock are presumed to be settled in stock for diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations, resulting in a potential dilutive effect influenced by the fair value of the preferred interests and the average stock price. This presumption applied to the Mobility II preferred interests, even though AT&T intended to settle them in cash. In 2023, after AT&T repurchased all of its Mobility preferred interests in April (as disclosed in Note 16), the dilutive impact previously considered under ASU 2020-06 was eliminated. Therefore, the adoption of ASU 2020-06 in 2022 introduced a new dilutive consideration for EPS reporting related to the Mobility preferred interests, which was later resolved in 2023 following the repurchase of those instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: T(2022) \u2192 Convertible Instruments: AT&T announced adoption of ASU 2020-06 for convertible instruments beginning 2022, impacting the treatment of Mobility II preferred interests, which could be settled in stock or cash and thus introduced a potential dilutive effect in EPS calculations.",
        "Hop 2: Convertible Instruments \u2192 ASU 2020-06: ASU 2020-06 changed the accounting model by eliminating certain separation models and requiring instruments that may be settled in stock to be presumed settled in stock for diluted EPS, which directly affected how convertible instruments like the Mobility preferred interests were treated.",
        "Hop 3: ASU 2020-06 \u2190 T(2023): In 2023, AT&T repurchased all of its Mobility preferred interests, and for periods prior to the repurchase, the diluted EPS calculation still reflected the stock-settlement presumption under ASU 2020-06."

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\nForeign Currency Translation Our foreign subsidiaries and foreign investments generally report their earnings in their local currencies. We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and expenses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3). Operations in countries with highly inflationary economies use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.\n\nWe hedge a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk involved in certain foreign currency-denominated transactions, which we explain further in our discussion of our methods of managing our foreign currency risk (see Note 13).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 15 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\nReference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting' (ASU 2020-04, as amended), which provides optional expedients, and allows for certain exceptions to existing GAAP, for contract modifications triggered by the expected market transition of certain benchmark interest rates to alternative reference rates. ASU 2020-04 applies to contracts, hedging relationships, certain derivatives and other arrangements that reference the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or any other rates ending after December 31, 2022. ASU 2020-04, as amended, became effective immediately. We do not believe our adoption of ASU 2020-04, including optional expedients, will materially impact our financial statements.\n\nConvertible Instruments Beginning with 2022 interim reporting, we will adopt ASU No. 2020-06, 'Debt-Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity' (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 eliminated certain separation models regarding cash conversion and beneficial conversion features to simplify reporting for convertible instruments as a single liability or equity, with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Additionally, ASU 202006 requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock are presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earnings per share. While our intent is to settle the Mobility II preferred interests in cash (see Note 17), settlement of this instrument in AT&amp;T shares will result in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&amp;T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. We are currently evaluating our adoption method and the impact on our financial statements, as our recent decision (February 2022) on methodology of distribution to AT&amp;T's shareholders (i.e., pro rata dividend) for the pending WarnerMedia transaction could affect the impact of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements (see Note 6).\n\nGovernment Assistance In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, 'Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance' (ASU 2021-10), which requires annual disclosures, in the notes to the financial statements, about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other guidance. The annual disclosures include terms and conditions, accounting treatment and impacted financial statement lines reflecting the impact of the transactions. ASU 2021-10 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, under prospective or retrospective application for all in scope government transactions in the financial statements as of our adoption date or thereafter. We are evaluating the disclosure impacts of our adoption of ASU 2021-10.",

The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt -Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\n\nAccordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, with $36.3 billion remaining available for further repurchases under the same authorization. Class B shares were not included in the repurchase program, indicating a strategic focus on managing Class A and Class C shares. In 2024, Class B shareholders received $519 million in dividends, showing that despite not being repurchased, Class B shares were still entitled to dividend distributions. This is consistent with the Certificate of Incorporation, which ensures that Class B shares maintain equal dividend rights with Class A and Class C shares, even though they have different voting rights. The Certificate of Incorporation also prevents the Board from altering these rights without approval, ensuring consistency in treatment across years.",

The repurchase program does not hav e an expiration date.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash div idends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectiv ely.\n\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash div idends in the future, subject to rev iew and approv al by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\n\n## Note 12. Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using  the  weighted-av erage  number  of  shares  outstanding  during  the  period.  Diluted  net  income  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-av erage number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutiv e securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutiv e securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutiv e effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conv ersion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conv ersion of those shares.\n\nIn accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and div idend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to v oting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law , which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share div idends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law prov ides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would hav e the effect of adv ersely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a giv en class of stock must be approv ed by the class of stock adv ersely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation prov ides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder v ote, it must be approv ed by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the tax ing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax  benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption 'Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nAt December 31, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as available-forsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , included in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $15.7 billion of debt, consisting of fix ed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\n\nAccordingly, volatility in ex change rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been approximately $1,424 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain ex posures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9 billion and $958 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Cost of Revenues' to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $187 million and $71 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.",

      "question": "How did the governance thresholds tied to Class B common stock's voting power influence investor protections for Class A shareholders between META's 2023 and 2024 filings, particularly in light of the 35% voting power threshold for change-of-control approvals?",
      "answer": "In 2023, META disclosed that as long as Class B common stock represented at least 35% of the combined voting power, any transaction resulting in a change of control required approval from a majority of Class B shareholders. This governance threshold limited investor protections for Class A shareholders, who held less voting power and were subject to a dual-class structure that favored Class B ownership. By 2024, while the exact percentage of Class B voting power had not yet dropped below 35%, the structure remained unchanged, continuing to concentrate decision-making authority with Class B shareholders. The CMCSA_2023 evidence further contextualizes this by showing that such dual-class structures commonly allocate disproportionate voting power (e.g., 66 2/3% for Class A and 33 1/3% for Class B in that case), reinforcing how META\u2019s governance model preserved control concentration, thus perpetuating reduced investor protections for Class A shareholders across both years.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T extended the termination date of its $12,000 million Revolving Credit Agreement by one year to November 18, 2028, and maintained a net debt-to-EBITDA covenant of 3.75-to-1. The agreement included Events of Default provisions that would accelerate required payments and increase the Applicable Margin by 2.00% per annum. In 2024, the agreement was further extended to November 18, 2029, maintaining the same financial covenant and Events of Default structure. The extension of the agreement's term reduced the near-term liquidity risk associated with the facility, thereby decreasing the likelihood of an Event of Default due to maturity. However, the core triggers and consequences of Events of Default remained unchanged, preserving the same level of covenant risk as in the prior year.",

Under the new agreement, VZ leased back a portion of the capacity for an initial term of 10 years with eight optional five-year renewal terms. This shift introduced a more structured leaseback with extended renewal flexibility and resulted in the recognition of $2.0 billion in prepaid rent and $830 million in financing obligations, reflecting a more complex financial arrangement compared to the earlier American Tower deal.",

      "question": "How did AT&T's adoption of ASU 2020-06 in 2022 impact the accounting treatment of convertible instruments by 2023, particularly regarding the dilutive effect of settling Mobility II preferred interests in stock versus cash?",
      "answer": "AT&T adopted ASU 2020-06 in 2022, which eliminated certain separation models for convertible instruments and required instruments that may be settled in cash or stock to be presumed settled in stock for diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations. By 2023, this change had a direct impact on the accounting treatment of the Mobility II preferred interests. Specifically, the dilutive effect of these instruments increased due to the presumption of stock settlement, which was influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&T common stock price during the reporting period. This presumption created variability in the dilutive impact from period to period, as seen in the 2023 disclosures.",

We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and expenses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3). Operations in countries with highly inflationary economies use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.\n\nWe hedge a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk involved in certain foreign currency-denominated transactions, which we explain further in our discussion of our methods of managing our foreign currency risk (see Note 13).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 15 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\nReference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting' (ASU 2020-04, as amended), which provides optional expedients, and allows for certain exceptions to existing GAAP, for contract modifications triggered by the expected market transition of certain benchmark interest rates to alternative reference rates. ASU 2020-04 applies to contracts, hedging relationships, certain derivatives and other arrangements that reference the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or any other rates ending after December 31, 2022. ASU 2020-04, as amended, became effective immediately. We do not believe our adoption of ASU 2020-04, including optional expedients, will materially impact our financial statements.\n\nConvertible Instruments Beginning with 2022 interim reporting, we will adopt ASU No. 2020-06, 'Debt-Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity' (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 eliminated certain separation models regarding cash conversion and beneficial conversion features to simplify reporting for convertible instruments as a single liability or equity, with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Additionally, ASU 202006 requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock are presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earnings per share. While our intent is to settle the Mobility II preferred interests in cash (see Note 17), settlement of this instrument in AT&amp;T shares will result in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&amp;T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. We are currently evaluating our adoption method and the impact on our financial statements, as our recent decision (February 2022) on methodology of distribution to AT&amp;T's shareholders (i.e., pro rata dividend) for the pending WarnerMedia transaction could affect the impact of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements (see Note 6).\n\nGovernment Assistance In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, 'Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance' (ASU 2021-10), which requires annual disclosures, in the notes to the financial statements, about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other guidance. The annual disclosures include terms and conditions, accounting treatment and impacted financial statement lines reflecting the impact of the transactions. ASU 2021-10 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, under prospective or retrospective application for all in scope government transactions in the financial statements as of our adoption date or thereafter. We are evaluating the disclosure impacts of our adoption of ASU 2021-10.",

The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt -Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\n\nAccordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did the introduction of META's dividend policy in February 2024 impact shareholder dynamics, given the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stockholders as of 2023?",
      "answer": "The introduction of META's first-ever dividend policy on February 1, 2024, marked a significant shift in shareholder dynamics, especially considering the existing voting power distribution. In 2023, Class B common stockholders (who held 33 1/3% of the combined voting power) were not publicly traded and had only 23 stockholders of record, compared to 3,098 stockholders of record for Class A common stock. With the initiation of the $0.50 per share dividend applicable to both Class A and Class B stock, the company extended financial benefits equally across both classes. However, since Class B stockholders retained disproportionate voting control (with 15 votes per share), the dividend policy change did not alter the governance influence of major stakeholders like Mr. Brian L. Roberts, who beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Thus, while the dividend policy aligned financial returns across shareholder classes, the structural voting power imbalance persisted into 2024.",

Financial risks are managed through diversification of plan assets, selection of investment managers and through the investment guidelines incorporated in investment management agreements. Investments are monitored to assess whether returns are commensurate with risks taken.\n\nThe long-term asset allocation policy for the master trust was established taking into consideration a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the average age of participants, the number of retirees, the duration of liabilities and the ex pected payout ratio. Liquidity needs of the master trust are generally managed using cash generated by investments or by liquidating securities.\n\nAssets are generally managed by external investment managers pursuant to investment management agreements that establish permitted securities and risk controls commensurate with the account's investment strategy. Some agreements permit the use of derivative securities (futures, options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps) that enable investment managers to enhance returns and manage exposures within their accounts.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements of Plan Assets\n\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and is generally classified in one of the following categories of the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets\n- Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable\n\nInvestments that are valued using the net asset value (NAV) (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy disclosure. NAV per share is determined based on the fair value using the underlying assets divided by the number of units outstanding.\n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets reported at fair value. The methodologies used at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are the same.\n\nLevel 1 investments are valued based on reported market prices on the last trading day of the fiscal year. Investments in common and preferred stocks and mutual funds are valued based on the securities' exchange-listed price or a broker's quote in an active market. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities are valued based on a broker's quote in an active market.\n\nLevel 2 investments in government and federal agency bonds and notes (excluding U.S. Treasury securities), corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and asset-backed securities are valued using a broker's quote in a non-active market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of reported market information, such as benchmark yield curves, credit spreads and estimated default rates. Derivative financial instruments are valued based on models that incorporate observable inputs for the underlying securities, such as interest rates or foreign currency ex change rates.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ESPNU had 51 million subscribers according to Nielsen Media Research, but by 2024, that number dropped to 47 million. This decline in traditional cable subscribers aligns with broader industry trends and likely prompted ESPN to focus more on digital platforms. As part of Disney's digital transformation strategy, ESPN introduced ESPN+, a direct-to-consumer service that grew to 26 million paid subscribers by September 2024. This shift from traditional cable (ESPNU) to streaming (ESPN+) reflects Disney's prioritization of digital distribution and direct consumer relationships, adapting to changing viewer preferences and mitigating subscriber losses in legacy platforms.",

      "question": "How did Netflix's use of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what impact did this have on the company's foreign currency risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix used foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing/production costs, with a notional hedging exposure of $8.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. By 2024, this notional amount increased to $9.9 billion as of September 28, 2024, indicating a more aggressive hedging strategy. The company also reported that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have reduced AOCI by $958 million in 2023, but this potential impact increased to $1.9 billion in 2024, showing greater sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations despite expanded hedging. This suggests that while Netflix increased its hedge coverage, the underlying foreign currency exposure also grew, particularly with significant exposure to the euro, British pound, and emerging market currencies like the Argentine peso, which contributed to a $1.424 billion unfavorable FX impact on 2024 revenues.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe do not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the tax ing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax  benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption 'Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nAt December 31, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as available-forsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , included in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $15.7 billion of debt, consisting of fix ed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\n\nAccordingly, volatility in ex change rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been approximately $1,424 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain ex posures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9 billion and $958 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Cost of Revenues' to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $187 million and $71 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Alphabet had 44,576,938 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, which carry 15 votes per share and are convertible into Class A shares. In 2023, the company clarified that Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, a key structural feature that likely influenced the decision to repurchase $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023\u2014up from $59.3 billion in 2022. Since Class C shares have no voting rights and Class B shares convert to Class A upon sale, the heavy repurchase of Class A and C shares may gradually dilute the relative voting power of remaining Class B holders over time, shifting control dynamics as more shares are retired and fewer high-vote shares remain in circulation.",

Participants are eligible to receive distributions from their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.\n\nWe have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, net, was $549 million and $481 million, respectively.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nWe sponsor  several  401(k)  defined  contribution  retirement  plans  that  allow  eligible  employees  to  contribute  a  portion  of  their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines.

      "question": "How did the automatic conversion of GOOGL's Class B shares upon sale or transfer influence the governance dynamics between 2022 and 2024, especially in the context of the company's increased share repurchase activity from $59.3 billion in 2022 to $62.0 billion in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL had 44,576,938 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, which carried 10 votes per share, compared to Class A shares with 1 vote per share. This structure concentrated voting power among insiders. However, the 2024 filing reveals that Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, potentially reducing long-term control concentration. This dynamic, combined with the company's increased share repurchases from $59.3 billion in 2022 to $62.0 billion in 2024, suggests a strategic balancing act: maintaining insider control through existing Class B holdings while reducing overall share count, which may preserve voting influence even as repurchases dilute non-insider stockholders.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney integrated National Geographic programming as a top-level tile within the Disney+ interface, signaling its strategic importance in content bundling and global DTC expansion. By 2024, Disney maintained its 73% ownership stake in National Geographic, continuing to leverage its brand across international linear networks and Disney+ services outside the U.S. and Latin America. Despite increased global competition and economic headwinds that pressured DTC pricing and subscriber retention in 2022, Disney preserved National Geographic's role in its content portfolio, suggesting a deliberate effort to sustain brand differentiation and subscriber appeal through high-quality, recognizable non-fiction programming. This continuity in content strategy implies that National Geographic remained a cornerstone of Disney\u2019s international DTC positioning even as the company navigated rising costs and distribution challenges.",

As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively.

      "answer": "In 2023, Shendi provided Shanghai Disney Resort with a 2.6 billion yuan (approximately $0.4 billion) line of credit at 8% interest, which had no balance outstanding. By 2024, Disney itself provided a smaller 1.9 billion yuan (approximately $0.3 billion) line of credit at the same 8% interest rate for the same resort. In contrast, for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort in 2024, Disney provided a larger HK $2.7 billion ($347 million) revolving credit facility at a lower rate of three-month HIBOR plus 1.25%. This suggests Disney may be taking a more direct financing role in Shanghai while maintaining a larger credit capacity with a more favorable interest structure in Hong Kong. The shift indicates a nuanced capital allocation strategy across its international parks.",

If one employer stops contributing, the remaining employers, including Disney, may be liable for the unfunded obligations. If eligibility requirements in 2023 were expanded or maintained, it could have increased participation in health and welfare plans, which may correlate with increased union-covered employees contributing to or being covered by pension plans in 2024, thereby increasing Disney\u2019s exposure to shared liabilities.

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T's Telco preferred interests had an initial distribution rate of 4.25% annually, with reset periods every seven years and a call provision exercisable after seven years. By 2024, AT&T introduced a new series (Class A-4) with a significantly higher initial distribution rate of 5.94%, a shorter reset period of four years starting in 2028, and a corresponding call provision beginning in 2028.

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA disclosed that holders of Class A common stock had 66 2/3% of the voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3%. By 2024, this structure remained unchanged, with Class A still holding 66 2/3% and Class B maintaining 33 1/3%. However, the number of issued Class A shares decreased from 4,842,108,959 in 2023 to 4,651,093,045 in 2024, while Class B shares remained constant at 9,444,375. Since Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares on a share-for-share basis, this slight reduction in Class A shares could marginally increase the relative voting influence of Class B shareholders unless conversion occurs. The non-dilutable nature of Class B voting power ensures that their 33 1/3% share of total voting rights cannot be diluted by additional issuances of other stock classes.",

      "question": "How did the change in Netflix's RSU award structure from 2023 to 2024 affect the alignment of these awards with voting rights, particularly in terms of vesting schedules and forfeiture conditions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix's RSU awards were governed by voting rights that applied only to common stock, and RSUs themselves did not carry voting rights, as seen in the 2023 disclosures. The RSUs generally vested on the third anniversary of the grant date and were subject to forfeiture if employment conditions were not met. By 2024, Netflix introduced a more nuanced RSU structure, including both time-based RSUs that vested quarterly over a three-year period and performance-based RSUs (PSUs) tied to market-based performance targets. This evolution suggests a strategic shift toward aligning executive compensation more closely with both time-based and performance-based outcomes, while still maintaining the lack of voting rights for RSU holders. The change in vesting and performance conditions indicates a more dynamic approach to equity compensation, even though the disconnect from voting rights remained consistent.",

      "question": "How might Alphabet's significant increase in stock-based compensation expense tied to Class C shares in 2023 have influenced its share repurchase decisions for Class A shares in 2024, particularly considering the economic cost and market conditions outlined in the filings?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alphabet reported a total stock-based compensation (SBC) expense of $22.1 billion, with $21.7 billion associated with awards expected to settle in Class C stock. This growing SBC expense, driven by RSU vesting, would have led to increasing share dilution over time. In the 2023 filings, the company indicated that share repurchases for both Class A and Class C stock were based on economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including relative trading prices and volumes. Given the structural similarity between Class A and Class C shares (identical rights except for voting power), and the company's stated approach of managing both share classes in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company, the significant SBC-related dilution from Class C shares likely prompted a more aggressive repurchase strategy for Class A shares in 2024 as a countermeasure. This aligns with the company's broader capital allocation strategy to manage dilution and maintain shareholder value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL(2023) \u2192 Class C Stock: Alphabet disclosed a $22.1 billion SBC expense in 2023, of which $21.7 billion was tied to awards expected to settle in Class C stock, indicating significant future dilution.",
        "Hop 2: Class C Stock \u2192 Class A Stock: Both share classes are treated similarly in terms of repurchase strategy, as disclosed in the 2023 filings, which state that repurchases consider the economic cost and market conditions of both classes.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Stock \u2190 GOOGL(2024): In the 2024 10-K filing, Class A shares remained a core component of Alphabet\u2019s capital structure, suggesting that repurchase decisions in 2024 were influenced by the dilutive impact of SBC from the prior year, particularly from Class C issuances."

      "question": "How did the increase in content licensing challenges with third-party providers in 2023 affect Netflix's streaming content availability and subsequent revenue generation from streaming services in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix's ability to provide content was increasingly dependent on third-party content providers, whose willingness to license content on acceptable terms was uncertain, especially as these providers developed their own streaming services. This dependency created risks around content withdrawal and rising programming costs. By 2024, these challenges were realized as content providers began restricting access to popular titles, leading to a more volatile and less predictable streaming content catalog. This instability in content availability, in turn, impacted Netflix's ability to attract and retain subscribers, which is central to its revenue model. While Netflix still primarily earned revenue from monthly membership fees (ranging from $1 to $32 per month), the increased cost of securing exclusive rights and the reduced reliability of content supply from providers placed downward pressure on subscriber growth and increased content acquisition costs, affecting profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX(2023) \u2192 Content Providers: Netflix's content availability depended heavily on licensing agreements with third-party content providers, many of whom were launching their own platforms and becoming less cooperative.",
        "Hop 2: Content Providers \u2192 Streaming Content: As content providers withheld or withdrew rights to popular content, Netflix faced a reduction in the breadth and appeal of its streaming catalog.",
        "Hop 3: Streaming Content \u2190 NFLX(2024): Netflix's revenue from streaming memberships was directly tied to the attractiveness of its content offering, and a diminished catalog led to slower subscriber growth and higher content costs in 2024."

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class  B  common stock having 15 votes per share.  The  Class  B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\n## Div idends\n\nWe expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL disclosed that RSUs under its stock plans typically settled in Class C stock, with $15.7 billion in stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2021 alone. By 2023, the company repurchased both Class A and Class C shares, with repurchase decisions influenced by the relative trading prices and volumes of both classes. Despite these repurchase activities, the net income per share amounts remained identical across Class A and Class C stock in 2023, just as they had been in 2022, due to the equal dividend and liquidation rights across classes. This indicates that while the company's repurchase behavior evolved in 2023\u2014potentially affecting supply dynamics of both stock classes\u2014the underlying economic alignment between Class C (used for compensation) and Class A (used for financial reporting) remained intact, preserving equity valuation consistency across both share classes.",

Compensation Plans\n\n## Stock Plans\n\nOur stock plans include the Alphabet Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan, the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan and Other Bet stock-based plans. Under our stock plans, RSUs and other types of awards may be granted. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award vests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting date.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 37,479,707 shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, total stock-based compensation expense was $11.7 billion, $13.4 billion, and $15.7 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $10.8 billion, $12.8 billion, and $15.0 billion, respectively.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2019,  2020,  and  2021,  we  recognized  tax  benefits  on  total  stock-based compensation expense, which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $1.8 billion, $2.7 billion, and $3.1 billion, respectively.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or exercised during the period was $2.2 billion, $3.6 billion, and $5.9 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&amp;D tax credit.\n\n## Stock-Based Award Activities\n\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n",

This change in accounting had a direct impact on how the company's convertible instruments, such as the Mobility II preferred interests, were treated in financial reporting. By 2024, AT&T disclosed that the settlement of these instruments in stock would result in a dilutive impact, the magnitude of which was influenced by the fair value of the Mobility preferred interests and the average AT&T common stock price during the reporting period. This reflects the ongoing influence of ASU 2020-06 on AT&T\u2019s financial disclosures and the evolving implications of its accounting choices on shareholder dilution.",

We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and expenses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3). Operations in countries with highly inflationary economies use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.\n\nWe hedge a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk involved in certain foreign currency-denominated transactions, which we explain further in our discussion of our methods of managing our foreign currency risk (see Note 13).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 15 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\nReference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting' (ASU 2020-04, as amended), which provides optional expedients, and allows for certain exceptions to existing GAAP, for contract modifications triggered by the expected market transition of certain benchmark interest rates to alternative reference rates. ASU 2020-04 applies to contracts, hedging relationships, certain derivatives and other arrangements that reference the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or any other rates ending after December 31, 2022. ASU 2020-04, as amended, became effective immediately. We do not believe our adoption of ASU 2020-04, including optional expedients, will materially impact our financial statements.\n\nConvertible Instruments Beginning with 2022 interim reporting, we will adopt ASU No. 2020-06, 'Debt-Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity' (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 eliminated certain separation models regarding cash conversion and beneficial conversion features to simplify reporting for convertible instruments as a single liability or equity, with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Additionally, ASU 202006 requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock are presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earnings per share. While our intent is to settle the Mobility II preferred interests in cash (see Note 17), settlement of this instrument in AT&amp;T shares will result in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&amp;T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. We are currently evaluating our adoption method and the impact on our financial statements, as our recent decision (February 2022) on methodology of distribution to AT&amp;T's shareholders (i.e., pro rata dividend) for the pending WarnerMedia transaction could affect the impact of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements (see Note 6).\n\nGovernment Assistance In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, 'Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance' (ASU 2021-10), which requires annual disclosures, in the notes to the financial statements, about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other guidance. The annual disclosures include terms and conditions, accounting treatment and impacted financial statement lines reflecting the impact of the transactions. ASU 2021-10 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, under prospective or retrospective application for all in scope government transactions in the financial statements as of our adoption date or thereafter. We are evaluating the disclosure impacts of our adoption of ASU 2021-10.",

The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt -Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\n\nAccordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&amp;T Inc. is referred to as 'AT&amp;T,' 'we' or the 'Company.' The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries and affiliates which we control. AT&amp;T is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries.\n\nOn April 8, 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business, which represented substantially all of our WarnerMedia segment, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which Magallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a formerly wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T that held the WarnerMedia business, was distributed to AT&amp;T stockholders via a pro rata dividend, followed by the combination of Spinco with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery), which was renamed Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (WBD). (See Note 6)\n\nUpon the separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations. For discontinued operations, we also evaluated transactions that were components of AT&amp;T's single plan of a strategic shift, including dispositions that previously did not individually meet the criteria due to materiality, and have determined discontinued operations to be comprised of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. (See Notes 6 and 24)\n\nAll significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in subsidiaries and partnerships which we do not control but have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included in our results on a one quarter lag. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees' other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including translation adjustments. We treat distributions received from equity method investees as returns on investment and classify them as cash flows from operating activities until those distributions exceed our cumulative equity in the earnings of that investment. We treat the excess amount as a return of investment and classify it as cash flows from investing activities. In the event we receive dividends in ex cess of the carrying amount of the investment, and we have no obligation to provide financial support to the equity method investee, we treat those dividends as returns on investment and classify them as cash flows from operating activities.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, including other estimates of fair value, probable losses and expenses, that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Moreover, unfavorable changes in market conditions, including interest rates, could adversely impact those estimates and result in asset impairments. Certain prior-period amounts have been conformed to the current period's presentation. Unless otherwise noted, the information in Notes 1 through 23 refer only to our continuing operations and do not include discussion of balances or activity of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic, which are part of discontinued operations.\n\n## Adopted and New Accounting Standards\n\nSegment Reporting In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, 'Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures' (ASU 2023-07). Beginning with our 2024 annual reporting, we adopted, through retrospective application, ASU No. 2023-07, which requires that a public entity disclose, on an interim and annual basis, significant segment expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to its chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss. An entity must also disclose, by reportable segment, the amount and composition of other expenses. The standard requires an entity disclose the title and position of its CODM and explain how the CODM uses these reported measures in assessing segment performance and determining how to allocate resources.\n\nConvertible Instruments Beginning with 2022 interim reporting, we adopted, through retrospective application, ASU No. 2020-06, 'Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity' (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock are presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earnings per share. Prior to the April 2023 repurchase, settlement of our Series A Cumulative Perpetual Membership Interests in AT&amp;T Mobility II LLC (Mobility preferred interests) could have resulted in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which was influenced by the fair value of the Mobility preferred interests and the average AT&amp;T common stock price during the reporting period, which varied from period-to-period (see Note 16).",

      "question": "How has AT&T's shift from holding Mobility II preferred equity in its pension trust to a commingled trust structure affected postretirement benefit funding through the VEBA Trust?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T's pension trust held $5,562 in preferred equity interests in AT&T Mobility II LLC, which represented a significant portion of its assets. By 2024, the pension and postretirement benefit plans were commingled in a single trust, with the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans holding 98.0% and 2.0% interests, respectively. This commingled structure directly impacts the VEBA Trust, as future postretirement benefit payments may be made from these trust assets, reducing the balance over time. The transition from a dedicated pension trust with specific equity holdings to a shared trust structure suggests a strategic reallocation that could influence both the funding stability and payout capacity of postretirement benefits managed through the VEBA Trust.",

During 2020, the trust sold a portion of these preferred interests valued at $2,885 to third party investors. The preferred equity interests were valued at $5,771 as of December 31, 2020.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, AT&amp;T securities represented 11% of assets held by our pension trust, including the preferred interests in Mobility II. The VEBA trusts included in these financial statements no longer hold AT&amp;T securities.\n\n## Investment Valuation\n\nInvestments are stated at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date.\n\nInvestments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at the last reported sales price on the final business day of the year. If no sale was reported on that date, they are valued at the last reported bid price. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Shares of registered investment companies are valued based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held at year-end.\n\nOther commingled investment entities are valued at quoted redemption values that represent the net asset values of units held at year-end which management has determined approximates fair value.\n\nReal estate and natural resource direct investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports. Fixed income securities valuation is based upon observable prices for comparable assets, broker/dealer quotes (spreads or prices), or a pricing matrix that derives spreads for each bond based on external market data, including the current credit rating for the bonds, credit spreads to Treasuries for each credit rating, sector add-ons or credits, issue-specific add-ons or credits as well as call or other options.\n\nThe preferred interests in Mobility II are valued by an independent fiduciary using an income approach.\n\nPurchases and sales of securities are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are determined on the basis of average cost. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date.\n\nNon-interest bearing cash and overdrafts are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nSee Note 13 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.",

      "answer": "CMCSA's 2023 financials disclose that Class B common stock is convertible, share for share, into Class A common stock. In 2023, 4,842,108,959 Class A shares were issued, while in 2024, this number decreased to 4,651,093,045 issued Class A shares. Despite the conversion mechanism, the total issued Class A shares decreased, suggesting either no significant conversion activity occurred in 2024 or repurchases offset any conversions. Retained earnings grew from $52,892 million in 2023 to $56,972 million in 2024, indicating a $4,080 million increase, which could have been impacted by the capital structure dynamics involving Class B to Class A conversions.",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock at CMCSA change from 2022 to 2024, and what implications did the potential convertibility of Class B shares into Class A shares have on shareholder influence during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, holders of Class A common stock held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock represented 33 1/3% of the voting power, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. By 2024, the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock were 9,444,375, and the Class B shares remained convertible into Class A shares on a share-for-share basis, subject to restrictions. The convertibility of Class B shares into Class A shares introduced a mechanism that could shift voting control over time, potentially diluting the concentrated influence of the holder of Class B shares (Mr. Brian L. Roberts) if conversions occurred. However, the non-dilutable nature of Class B voting power under the articles of incorporation meant that any such shift would depend on actual conversion events, which were not reported in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: In 2022, Class A shareholders held 66 2/3% of the voting power, with Class B holding the remaining 33 1/3%.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class B shares were convertible into Class A shares on a one-to-one basis, subject to restrictions, indicating a potential pathway for shifting voting control.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(2024): In 2024, 9,444,375 Class B shares remained outstanding, and the structure still allowed for conversion, preserving the potential for future influence shifts."

The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate. Participants are eligible to receive distributions from their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.\n\nWe have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, net, was $549 million and $481 million, respectively.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nWe sponsor  several  401(k)  defined  contribution  retirement  plans  that  allow  eligible  employees  to  contribute  a  portion  of  their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines. We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees' contributions up to certain limits. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, expenses related to these plans totaled $595 million, $599 million and $573 million, respectively.\n\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We also participate in other multiemployer benefit plans that  provide health and welfare and retirement savings benefits to active and retired participants. If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or were to otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law would require us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by other participating  employers  may  lead  to  adverse  changes  in  the  financial  condition  of  one  of  these  plans,  which  could  result  in  an increase  in  our  withdrawal  liability.  Total  contributions  we  made  to  multiemployer  benefit  plans  and  any  potential  withdrawal liabilities were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Note 12: Equity\n\n## Common Stock\n\nIn the aggregate, holders of our Class A common stock have 66 /3% of the voting power of our common stock and holders of our Class B common stock have 33 /3% of the voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation.

      "question": "How did the change in Disney's Value at Risk (VAR) model estimates from fiscal 2022 ($395 million) to fiscal 2023 ($284 million) reflect the company's evolving approach to hedging firm commitments through foreign exchange derivatives?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney's VAR model estimated a maximum potential one-day loss of $395 million, reflecting its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity risks. The model excluded forecasted transactions and firm commitments, focusing instead on existing financial instruments. By fiscal 2023, the VAR estimate had decreased to $284 million, indicating a reduction in overall risk exposure, likely due to lower interest rate volatility. During this time, Disney actively used foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge firm commitments and forecasted transactions, with $8.3 billion in notional amounts of net foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of fiscal year-end 2023. This suggests that while the VAR model showed a lower risk profile in 2023, the company maintained a robust hedging strategy focused on firm commitments, aligning its risk management practices with both market conditions and strategic financial planning.",

By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.\n\nIt is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.\n\n## Value at Risk (VAR)\n\nThe Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis increased to $395 million at October 1, 2022 from $364 million at October 2, 2021.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, there were only 3 record holders of Class B common stock, with Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owning all outstanding shares, giving him significant voting control due to the 15 votes per share associated with Class B stock. Class A common stockholders collectively held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock accounted for 33 1/3%. By 2024, the number of issued Class A shares increased from 4,651,093,045 in 2022 to 4,842,108,959 in 2024. Despite this increase, the voting power of Class A shares remained diluted because Class B shares retained their non-dilutable 33 1/3% of voting power, which is structurally protected under the company's articles of incorporation.

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share.

In 2023, the same regulatory rule was referenced, and the structure remained consistent, indicating no significant change in the company's reliance on subsidiary earnings for servicing public debt.

By 2023, the certificate of incorporation included additional safeguards that required approval by the affected class of stock for any amendments that would adversely alter their rights, powers, or preferences. Furthermore, in 2023, the Board of Directors had to unanimously approve any such amendment before it could be put to a stockholder vote.

      "answer": "Disney's VAR exposure decreased from $395 million in 2022 to $255 million in 2024, reflecting a reduction in market risk, particularly due to lower interest rate volatility. Despite this decline, the company consistently excluded forecasted transactions from its VAR model in both years, meaning the model did not account for future expected exposures in its risk estimation. However, the company actively hedges forecasted foreign exchange transactions using forward and option contracts, with notional amounts increasing from $8.3 billion in 2023 to $9.9 billion in 2024. This suggests that while forecasted transactions were not part of the VAR model, they were still managed through direct hedging strategies, indicating a dual approach: modeling only current exposures while proactively mitigating future ones.",

By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.\n\nIt is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.\n\n## Value at Risk (VAR)\n\nThe Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis increased to $395 million at October 1, 2022 from $364 million at October 2, 2021.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company's computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt, interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis decreased to $255 million at September 28, 2024 from $284 million at September 30, 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "question": "How did the evolution of redemption options tied to AT&T's subsidiary preferred interests change between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to the Telco LLC preferred interests?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T disclosed that holders of preferred interests in its subsidiaries, including Telco LLC, had the option to require redemption upon contingent events such as failure to pay distributions for two or more periods or not meeting minimum credit ratings. The redemption mechanism allowed AT&T to settle these obligations with cash or AT&T common stock, with a cap of 250 million shares of stock. By 2024, AT&T had expanded its issuance of preferred interests in Telco LLC, increasing the total from $2,000 (in 2020) to $7,250, with new classes (A-2 and A-3) introduced in April 2023. These new classes carried a higher initial preferred distribution rate of 6.85%, subject to reset in 2027. The redemption terms remained largely consistent, with AT&T retaining the right to call the interests after seven years from issuance, but the increased scale and complexity of the preferred interests structure suggest a strategic shift toward leveraging these instruments more heavily in capital planning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: T(2022) \u2192 Redemption Option: AT&T disclosed redemption options tied to subsidiary preferred interests, including the ability to settle with cash or stock, capped at 250 million shares.",
        "Hop 2: Redemption Option \u2192 Telco Preferred Interests: The redemption options were specifically tied to Telco LLC preferred interests, which were subject to contingent redemption upon failure to pay distributions or credit rating issues.",
        "Hop 3: Telco Preferred Interests \u2190 T(2024): By 2024, AT&T had significantly expanded its Telco LLC preferred interests from $2,000 to $7,250, introducing new classes with higher distribution rates and maintaining the same redemption framework."

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nAuthorized Shares We have authorized 14 billion common shares of AT&amp;T stock and 10 million preferred shares of AT&amp;T stock, each with a par value of $1.00 per share. Cumulative perpetual preferred shares consist of the following:\n\n- Series A: 48 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference and a dividend rate of 5.000%.\n- Series B: 20 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a \u20ac100,000 per share liquidation preference, and an initial rate of 2.875%, subject to reset after May 1, 2025.\n- Series C: 70 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference, and a dividend rate of 4.75%.\n\nSo long as the quarterly preferred dividends are declared and paid on a timely basis on each series of preferred shares, there are no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T common shares. The preferred shares are optionally redeemable by AT&amp;T at the liquidation price on or after five years from the issuance date, or upon certain other contingent events.\n\nStock Repurchase Program From time to time, we repurchase shares of common stock for distribution through our employee benefit plans or in connection with certain acquisitions. Our Board of Directors has approved the following authorization to repurchase common stock: (1) March 2013 authorization program of 300 million shares, which was completed in 2020 and (2) March 2014 authorization program for 300 million shares, with approximately 178 million outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n\nTo implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 142 million shares totaling $5,278 under the March 2013 and March 2014 authorizations. During 2021, there were no shares repurchased under the March 2014 authorization.\n\nDividend Declarations In December 2021 and December 2020, AT&amp;T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $36 and a quarterly common dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock.\n\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries We have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration. The preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Mobility II\n\nWe previously issued 320 million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), representing all currently outstanding Mobility preferred equity interests, which pay cash distributions of $560 per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions are declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred equity interests will not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares.\n\nA holder of the Mobility preferred interests may put the interests to Mobility II. Mobility II may redeem the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022. When either option arises due to a passage of time, that option may be exercised only during certain periods.\n\nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) twenty-five dollars ($8,000 in the aggregate) plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price may be paid with cash, AT&amp;T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&amp;T common stock, at Mobility II's sole election. In no event shall Mobility II be required to deliver more than 250 million shares of AT&amp;T common stock to settle put and redemption options. We have the intent and ability to settle the Mobility preferred equity interests with cash.\n\n## Tower Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.",

These preferred interests were redeemed on November 6, 2020. (See Note 6)\n\nThe membership interests in PR Holdings consisted of (1) common interests, which were held by consolidated subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (PR preferred interests). The PR preferred interests paid an initial preferred distribution at an annual rate of 4.75%. Distributions were paid quarterly, subject to declaration.\n\n## NOTE 18. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and a deferred purchase price, and (2) revolving service and trade receivables. Under these programs, we transfer receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, where applicable. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to 'Total Assets' reported on our consolidated balance sheets.

A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period.

In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $7,250 (collectively the 'Telco preferred interests').\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consists of (1) members' interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter.

      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL disclosed the distinct voting rights structure of its Class B common stock, which granted 10 votes per share and could be converted to Class A common stock upon sale or transfer. This structural feature likely influenced the company's strategic repurchase of Class A and Class C shares, as seen in 2024, where $62.0 billion worth of shares were repurchased. The emphasis on Class A shares in repurchase decisions may reflect efforts to manage voting control while optimizing shareholder value, particularly as Class B stockholders retain significant influence due to their higher voting power.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL had 300,754,904 shares of Class A common stock and 44,576,938 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, with Class A shares carrying one vote and Class B shares carrying ten votes each. By 2024, the company continued repurchasing both Class A and Class C shares, spending $62.0 billion in 2024 alone, with $44.7 billion still available for future repurchases. The multi-class structure, where Class B shares held disproportionate voting power, likely influenced the decision to repurchase Class A and Class C shares rather than Class B, preserving the voting control of major stakeholders while reducing overall share count and potentially increasing earnings per share for remaining stockholders.",

      "answer": "Disney's approach to interest rate risk management remained largely consistent between 2022 and 2024, with the company not designating pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in either year. In 2022, the company noted that it did not have any pay-fixed swaps designated for hedging interest payments, and gains or losses from such instruments were not material. This pattern continued in 2024, with similar disclosures indicating no material changes in the use of pay-fixed swaps for interest rate hedging. However, by 2024, there was a visible impact of $0.9 billion in market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges, suggesting that while Disney wasn't actively using pay-fixed swaps to hedge interest payments, it still had interest rate derivatives in place that affected the valuation of its floating-rate borrowings. This indicates a shift from direct cash flow hedging to a more passive management of interest rate exposure through embedded derivative instruments rather than active swap strategies.",

        "Hop 1: DIS(2022) \u2192 Pay-Fixed Interest Rate Swaps: Disney disclosed it did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in 2022, and related gains/losses were immaterial.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META disclosed that its controlled company status and dual-class stock structure, which gave Class B shareholders disproportionate voting control, could make Class A common stock less attractive to investors due to reduced corporate governance protections. The structure included a 35% voting power threshold that required Class B approval for change-of-control transactions. By 2024, META continued to disclose this structure, with 343,761,117 Class B shares still outstanding, maintaining Mark Zuckerberg's control. The voting rights remained asymmetric, with Class B shares having significantly more voting power than Class A shares.

      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T noted that future benefit payments could be made from the VEBA Trust, which would reduce its asset balances, and at that time, the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans had allocable interests of 98.0% and 2.0%, respectively, in the commingled trust. By 2024, the Pension Trust held AT&T securities representing less than 1% of its assets, while the VEBA Trust held none.

      "question": "How did the shift in Disney's strategic focus from linear sports channels like the ACC Network in 2023 to ESPN+ in 2024 affect subscriber trends and investment allocation across these platforms?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the ACC Network had 44 million subscribers as part of Disney\u2019s traditional ESPN linear channel lineup (chunk 2), reflecting continued reliance on MVPD and cable distribution. By 2024, Disney emphasized ESPN+ as a key growth driver, reporting 26 million paid subscribers to the DTC service (chunk 3), which suggests a strategic reallocation of resources toward direct-to-consumer distribution. This shift aligns with broader financial moves: ESPN+ revenue now comes primarily from subscription fees and bundles with Disney+ and Hulu, signaling a pivot away from traditional linear sports channels like the ACC Network. The earlier year\u2019s cost structure (chunk 1) \u2014 dominated by programming rights and production costs \u2014 likely funded both linear and streaming offerings, but the 2024 focus on ESPN+ indicates a prioritization of scalable, lower-cost DTC infrastructure over linear channel maintenance.",

By 2024, the strategic relationship evolved as Disney's stake in A+E led to financial implications when a content license agreement was terminated, resulting in a $56 million gain attributable to Disney's share of A+E's profits.

We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results.

If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "answer": "In 2022, ESPN's programming and production costs increased by 32%, reaching $14,155 million, which included significant investments in ESPN+ and other digital platforms. This cost growth was directly tied to ESPN's expanded content production capabilities, including its programming on ABC, which is branded as ESPN on ABC. By 2023, Disney strategically emphasized ESPN on ABC as part of its broader Sports segment, leveraging the ABC network to distribute ESPN's sports content to a broader audience. This strategic emphasis was evident in Disney's plans to launch a new DTC offering in 2025 that will include live linear streams of ESPN-branded channels and ESPN+. The increased investment in 2022 thus supported Disney's 2023 strategy of expanding ESPN's reach through both traditional broadcast (ESPN on ABC) and digital platforms, reflecting a coordinated approach to content programming and distribution.",

      "question": "How did the change in the number of Class B common stockholders from 2022 to 2024 influence the voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B common stock, particularly considering the non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power held by Class B shares?",
      "answer": "In 2022, there were only 3 record holders of Class B common stock, which collectively maintained 33 1/3% of the combined voting power due to their 15-vote-per-share structure. By 2024, this non-dilutable voting structure remained unchanged, but the total issued shares of Class A common stock decreased from 4,842,108,959 in 2023 to 4,651,093,045 in 2024, while Class B shares remained constant at 9,444,375. This reduction in Class A shares could have increased the relative influence of Class B shareholders within the overall voting framework, despite the fixed 33 1/3% allocation. The relationship between the two stock classes highlights a strategic governance structure where a small group of Class B holders retains significant voting control.",

      "answer": "META's strategic prioritization of Reels in 2023, which was explicitly stated to monetize at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, likely contributed to downward pressure on Facebook's average price per ad metric in 2024. The 2023 filing acknowledged that promoting Reels would 'monetize at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future,' while the 2024 filing showed Facebook remained central to ad delivery but did not report an increase in average price per ad. This suggests the shift in user engagement toward a less monetizable format may have constrained ad pricing power in the following year.",

        "Hop 1: META(2023) \u2192 Reels: META acknowledged in 2023 that Reels would monetize at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, despite being strategically prioritized to grow user engagement.",

        "Hop 3: Facebook \u2190 META(2024): In 2024, Facebook remained the primary vehicle for ad delivery, with no reported increase in average price per ad despite continued ad impression growth."

      "answer": "In 2022, Alphabet's Certificate of Incorporation, governed by Delaware law, included safeguards that prevented the Board from declaring unequal per-share dividends across Class A, B, and C stock without approval from affected stockholders and unanimous board consent (Chunk 1). This governance framework ensured dividend parity across all classes. In 2023, the Certificate of Incorporation was interpreted alongside the company's capital structure, which granted Class B shares 10 votes per share while Class A had 1 vote and Class C had none (Chunk 2). Given these voting rights disparities and the governance constraints on dividend differentiation, Alphabet's Board executed a $62.2 billion share repurchase program in 2023 that exclusively targeted Class A and Class C shares (Chunk 3), likely to avoid altering the existing voting power distribution held by Class B shareholders while still returning capital to less-voting stock classes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIf approval is obtained, each of the Company's stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 (the 'Record Date'), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of the same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.\n\n## Note 12. Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\n\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical,  except  with  respect  to  voting.  Furthermore,  there  are  a  number  of  safeguards  built  into  our  certificate  of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends  on  our  Class  A,  Class  B,  and  Class  C  stock.  Specifically,  Delaware  law  provides  that  amendments  to  our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that  before  any  such  amendment  may  be  put  to  a  stockholder  vote,  it  must  be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney emphasized substantial upfront investments in facilities like hotels, noting the risk if market conditions shifted, and highlighted Disneyland Paris's hotel operations with 5,750 rooms and 250,000 square feet of conference space, along with 2,100 independently operated rooms. By 2023, this strategy appeared to evolve into a broader development vision for Val d'Europe, where Disney transitioned from direct hotel operations to enabling third-party developments on leased or purchased land, including commercial and residential spaces beyond just hotels. This reflects a shift from direct capital-intensive investment to a more asset-light model leveraging external partners, aligning with Disney\u2019s broader focus on monetizing land assets while reducing operational exposure. The 2023 Val d'Europe developments\u2014featuring a town center with shopping, office, and residential space\u2014suggest that earlier hotel investments served as a catalyst for attracting third-party investment and expanding the resort ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nentertainment experiences. Demand for certain of our out-of-home entertainment experiences, such as theater-going to watch movies, has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, and COVID-19 may continue to impact consumer tastes and preferences. In addition, many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S. The success of our businesses therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in content production and acquisition, acquisition of sports rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other facilities or customer facing platforms before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance, and these products may be introduced into a significantly different market or economic or social climate from the one we anticipated at the time of the investment decisions. If our entertainment offerings and products (including our content offerings, which have been impacted by COVID-19 and may in the future be impacted by COVID-19 developments or other health outbreaks or pandemics) as well as our methods to make our offerings and products available to consumers, do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue may decline, decline further or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby further adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. Further, consumers' perceptions of our position on matters of public interest, including our efforts to achieve certain of our environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. Consumer tastes and preferences impact, among other items, revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air), affiliate fees, subscription fees, theatrical film receipts, the license of rights to other distributors, theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, sales of licensed consumer products or sales of our other consumer products and services.\n\n## The success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create.\n\nThe value to us of our IP is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our IP may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. The terms of some copyrights for IP related to some of our products and services have expired and other copyrights will expire in the future. For example, in the United States and countries that look to the United States copyright term when shorter than their own, the copyright term for early works such as the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), and the specific early versions of characters depicted in those works, expires at the end of the 95th calendar year after the date the copyright was originally secured in the United States. Revenues generated from this intellectual property could be negatively impacted.\n\nThe unauthorized use of our IP may increase the cost of protecting rights in our IP or reduce our revenues. The convergence of computing, communication and entertainment devices, increased broadband internet speed and penetration, increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of IP rights more challenging. The unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for IP rights holders. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry IP in one country can adversely affect the results of the Company's operations worldwide, despite the Company's efforts to protect its IP rights. COVID-19 and distribution innovation in response to COVID-19 has increased opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways. Additionally, negative economic conditions coupled with a shift in government priorities could lead to less enforcement. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our IP against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content and other commercial misuses of our IP.\n\nWith respect to IP developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in IP may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from or utilize the IP that is the subject of challenged rights. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain IP rights of third parties. Technological changes in industries in which the Company operates and extensive patent coverage in those areas may increase the risk of such claims being brought and prevailing.\n\n## Protection of electronically stored data and other cybersecurity is costly, and if our data or systems are materially compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities, damage to our reputation, disruption of service or theft of our assets.\n\nWe maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. We also use computer systems to deliver our products and services and operate our businesses. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access, modification, exfiltration, destruction or denial of access and our computer systems are subject to cyberattacks that may result in disruptions in service. We use many third-party systems and software, which are also subject to supply chain and other",

      "answer": "In 2022, the ACC Network had an estimated 50 million subscribers, as reported under Disney's ESPN-branded channels, which included ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, and others with subscriber counts ranging from 51 to 74 million. The ACC Network was explicitly listed as part of ESPN's domestic sports channel portfolio, indicating its role in ESPN's college sports coverage. By 2023, Disney disclosed that international ESPN-branded channels had grown to approximately 55 million subscribers across 115 countries, signaling a strategic expansion beyond the U.S. market. This suggests a shift in focus from primarily domestic college sports networks like the ACC Network to broader international sports content distribution, leveraging ESPN's brand and production capabilities.",

      "answer": "Disney held a stake in ESPNU in 2022, which had 51 million subscribers. By 2024, ESPNU's subscriber base dropped to 47 million, while ESPN2, which Disney directly produced, maintained a stable 66 million subscribers. This shift suggests Disney may have reallocated resources toward more popular and stable platforms like ESPN2, potentially optimizing its sports channel portfolio for broader audience retention and monetization. The decline in ESPNU's subscriber base, contrasted with ESPN2's consistent reach, likely influenced Disney's strategic focus on channels with stronger market performance.",

Class B shares were convertible into Class A shares on a one-to-one basis, subject to restrictions.

This suggests potential conversions occurred, yet the non-dilutable voting threshold for Class B remained intact due to structural protections in the articles of incorporation.

We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees' contributions up to certain limits. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, expenses related to these plans totaled $595 million, $599 million and $573 million, respectively.\n\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions.

      "question": "How did Netflix's auditor adjust their sensitivity analyses of content amortization assumptions between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about the evolution of Netflix's content investment risk management?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix's auditor conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate how changes in assumptions like viewing patterns could impact content amortization timing, focusing on controls over data completeness and accuracy. In 2023, the auditor continued performing similar sensitivity analyses but maintained the same core methodology while still emphasizing the subjective nature of estimating future viewing patterns. The consistency in audit approach suggests Netflix's content investment risk management remained focused on forecasting accuracy rather than methodological changes. This reveals that Netflix's financial reporting risk around content amortization remained stable year-over-year, with no significant shifts in how viewing pattern assumptions were managed or challenged through audit procedures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Star Wars was a major licensed property under Disney's merchandise licensing operations, contributing to royalty revenue based on third-party product sales across categories like toys and apparel. By 2024, Star Wars content was integrated into Disney+, which saw a 10% increase in subscription fees due to higher effective rates and 6% subscriber growth. This indicates that the Star Wars brand, previously monetized primarily through licensing, was leveraged in the DTC space to drive both pricing power and subscriber expansion. The evolution from product licensing to content-driven subscriptions shows a strategic shift in how Disney monetized the Star Wars franchise.",

The Company licenses characters from its film, television and other properties for use on third-party products in these categories and earns royalties, which are usually based on a fixed percentage of the wholesale or retail selling price of the products. Some of the major properties licensed by the Company include: Mickey and Friends, Star Wars, Spider-Man, Disney Princess, Avengers, Frozen, Toy Story, Winnie the Pooh and Cars.\n\n## Retail\n\nThe Company sells Disney-, Marvel-, Pixar- and Lucasfilm-branded products through shopDisney branded internet sites and Disney Store branded retail locations. At October 1, 2022, the Company owns and operates approximately 40 stores in Japan, 20 stores in North America, three stores in Europe and one store in China.\n\nThe Company creates, distributes and publishes a variety of products in multiple countries and languages based on the Company's branded franchises. The products include children's books and comic books.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\n\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\n\n## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\n\nThe Company's businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its IP, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. Important IP includes rights in the content of motion pictures, television programs, electronic games, sound recordings, character likenesses, theme park attractions, books and magazines, and merchandise. Risks related to the protection and exploitation of IP rights and information concerning the expiration of certain of our copyrights are set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\n\n## AVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available without charge on our website, www.disney.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The increase in impressions was due to Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar growth, in part reflecting the launches of the ad-supported Disney+ service domestically in December 2022 and internationally starting in November 2023 and airing more cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar. There were two significant International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year.\n\n## Revenues - Other\n\nThe increase in other revenue was due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nIn addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business: (1)\n\nPaid subscribers at:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the pattern of Alphabet's share repurchases between 2023 and 2024 impact the relative ownership balance between Class A and Class B shareholders, particularly in light of the automatic conversion feature of Class B shares upon transfer?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, with $36.3 billion remaining available under the repurchase program as of year-end. In 2024, the company repurchased $62.0 billion of these shares and authorized an additional $70.0 billion program, with $44.7 billion remaining available by year-end. Since Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, the continued heavy repurchase of Class A shares may have shifted the ownership balance by reducing the float of Class A shares while leaving Class B shares (often held by insiders) relatively untouched. This could concentrate voting control among existing Class B shareholders, despite the broader repurchase activity.",

      "answer": "The reduction in issued Class A shares from 4.84 billion in 2023 to 4.65 billion in 2024 suggests a decrease of 190 million shares. However, the Class B common stock, which is convertible share for share into Class A common stock, remained unchanged at 9.44 million shares in both years. Given that the 2023 filing explicitly disclosed that Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares, the lack of any change in the Class B share count indicates that no significant conversions occurred during this period. Therefore, the decrease in Class A shares is likely attributable to other factors such as share repurchases or retirements, rather than conversions from Class B stock.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ESPN+ and other streaming services incurred $1.564 billion in programming costs, reflecting significant investment in content. By 2024, ESPN+ was being bundled with Disney+ and Hulu, contributing to Disney+'s subscription fee revenue growth of 10%, driven by higher effective rates and a 6% increase from subscriber growth. This bundling strategy, which leveraged ESPN+'s exclusive live sports content such as UFC pay-per-view events and international cricket programming, helped attract and retain subscribers, despite a 2% offset from foreign exchange impacts. The evolution from standalone costs to a bundled revenue driver illustrates how ESPN+ content investments in 2022 supported Disney+'s revenue growth and strategic positioning in 2024.",

(2)\n\nESPN+ is a domestic subscription-based DTC service offering thousands of live sporting events, on-demand sports content and other original programming. The service is offered individually or in various bundles with Disney+ and Hulu to customers directly or through third-party distributors on mobile and internet connected devices. ESPN+ revenue is derived from subscription fees, pay-per-view fees and, to a lesser extent, advertising. Live events available through the service include mixed martial arts, soccer, hockey, boxing, baseball, college sports, golf, tennis and cricket. ESPN+ is currently the ex clusive distributor for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) pay-per-view events in the U.S. As of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid ESPN+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 26 million.\n\n## International ESPN\n\nThe Company operates approximately 45 ESPN branded sports channels outside the U.S. in 4 languages and approximately 115 countries/territories. In the Netherlands, the ESPN branded channels are operated by Eredivisie Media &amp; Marketing CV (EMM) (owned 51% by the Company), which has the media and sponsorship rights to the Dutch Premier League for soccer. Rights include various soccer leagues (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).

The increase in impressions was due to Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar growth, in part reflecting the launches of the ad-supported Disney+ service domestically in December 2022 and internationally starting in November 2023 and airing more cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar. There were two significant International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year.\n\n## Revenues - Other\n\nThe increase in other revenue was due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nIn addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business: (1)\n\nPaid subscribers at:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA disclosed its Class A Common Stock structure, which forms the basis of shareholder voting rights. By 2024, the detailed explanation showed that holders of Class A common stock collectively held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock, which carries 15 votes per share, represented the remaining 33 1/3% of voting power. Notably, Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owned all outstanding shares of Class B common stock, giving him outsized influence over corporate decisions. Additionally, the 2024 financial report showed that 4,651,093,045 shares of Class A common stock were issued, with 3,778,302,017 shares outstanding, compared to 9,444,375 shares of Class B common stock, which are non-dilutable. This structure reinforced the dual-class voting disparity, concentrating significant decision-making power in a single shareholder.",

      "question": "How did the voting rights distribution between Class A and Class B shares at Comcast evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what implications does this have for potential shifts in shareholder control through conversions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Class B shares were held by only 3 record holders, giving them significant concentrated control despite being a minority voting class (33 1/3% of total voting power). By 2024, each share of Class B common stock remained entitled to 15 votes, while the number of votes per Class A share was dynamically adjusted based on the total outstanding shares of both classes. The 2024 filing shows 4,651,093,045 Class A shares issued in 2024 (vs. 4,842,108,959 in 2023), with Class B shares remaining at 9,444,375. The voting power distribution remained structurally fixed at 66 2/3% for Class A and 33 1/3% for Class B, but the convertibility of Class B shares to Class A creates potential for control shifts if conversions occur. This structure allows Class B holders to maintain outsized influence while retaining the option to convert to the majority-vote class.",

By 2023, Disney held a 50% stake in A+E, which operated Lifetime alongside A&E and HISTORY, each with 58 million subscribers as of September 2024. This shift from direct ownership to a joint venture reflects a strategic move toward shared risk and collaborative content production across multiple cable networks, rather than maintaining full control over individual channels.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Alphabet's financial reporting assumed the conversion of Class B stock in the computation of diluted net income per share of Class A stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock did not assume the conversion of those shares. This asymmetry in treatment reflects a nuanced approach to earnings per share reporting that considers the structural differences between the share classes. By 2024, Alphabet continued to disclose Class A stock as a registered security but did not specifically reiterate the same level of detail regarding Class B stock treatment in diluted EPS calculations. This suggests a potential shift in emphasis toward Class A shares in public financial disclosures, possibly aligning with investor focus or internal capital structure optimization.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META's corporate governance structure limited investor protections because its dual-class stock arrangement gave Mark Zuckerberg outsized control, and any change in control required approval by a majority of Class B shareholders while Class B common stock represented at least 35% of the combined voting power. By 2024, Class B common stock had fallen below the 35% threshold, triggering structural changes: board vacancies could no longer be filled by stockholders, the board became classified into staggered three-year terms with directors removable only for cause, and stockholder actions became restricted to formal meetings. This shift reduced minority investor influence further, despite potential expectations that governance would become more balanced as Class B voting power declined.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney reported notional amounts of $7.4 billion for foreign exchange cash flow hedges, which included firm commitments, with $704 million in net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts maturing in the next twelve months. By 2024, Disney's notional amounts for foreign exchange cash flow hedges increased to $9.9 billion, though the deferred gains decreased significantly to $99 million for the next twelve months. This indicates a substantial increase in the scale of hedging activities, particularly through option contracts, but a reduction in the near-term unrealized gains, potentially reflecting changes in foreign exchange market conditions or shifts in Disney's hedging strategy.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA reported only 3 record holders for Class B Common Stock, which carries 15 votes per share and represents a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power. This concentrated ownership structure, with Brian L. Roberts as the primary beneficial owner, inherently gives disproportionate voting control over corporate decisions. In 2023, the company continued to register Class A Common Stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, maintaining the dual-class structure. The persistence of this structure, combined with the fixed 33 1/3% voting power for Class B shares, suggests that governance decisions in 2023 were still significantly influenced by the small group of Class B shareholders, despite Class A shareholders collectively holding the remaining 66 2/3% of voting power.

      "question": "How did Alphabet's approach to repurchasing Class A and Class C shares evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of the stated factors influencing these decisions and the governance mechanisms ensuring equal treatment across share classes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Alphabet disclosed the existence of both Class A and Class C shares, which have identical rights except for voting power, and indicated that repurchase decisions were guided by economic cost and prevailing market conditions. By 2023, the company clarified that repurchases of both Class A and Class C shares were executed based on relative trading prices and volumes, general business conditions, and other investment opportunities, with repurchase programs conducted through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The governance framework remained consistent across years: Delaware law and Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation prevented unequal dividend treatment, requiring unanimous board approval for any amendments that could adversely affect a class of stock. This governance structure ensured that undistributed earnings were allocated proportionally across share classes, aligning with the consistent net income per share reported for Class A, Class B, and Class C stock in 2021, 2022, and 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [GOOGL](2022) \u2192 [Class A Stock]: In 2022, Alphabet disclosed the existence of Class A shares and their listing on the Nasdaq, alongside Class C shares, noting identical rights except for voting.",
        "Hop 2: [Class A Stock] \u2192 [Class C Stock]: Both share classes are explicitly linked in governance and financial rights, with the 2023 filing noting equal dividend and liquidation rights and the same net income per share across all classes for 2021\u20132023.",
        "Hop 3: [Class C Stock] \u2190 [GOOGL](2023): In 2023, Alphabet detailed how share repurchases for both Class A and Class C shares were conducted based on relative trading prices, volumes, and market conditions, with a consistent governance framework ensuring equal treatment."

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney used option contracts as part of its strategy to hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions, although specific notional amounts for that year are not provided. By 2024, the notional amount of Disney's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges had increased to $9.9 billion, up from $8.3 billion in 2023, indicating a growing hedge exposure. The principal currencies hedged remained consistent, including the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, and Chinese yuan. This evolution reflects a strategic increase in the scale of option contract usage to manage foreign exchange risk over the two-year period.",

Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment. Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g. forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g. floating-rate debt).\n\nThe Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities.

Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&amp;T and long-term growth opportunities.\n\nOur 2025 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and repurchasing common stock when deemed appropriate. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.\n\n## Credit Facilities\n\nThe following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. We currently have a $12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2029 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\n\nWe also utilize other ex ternal financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.\n\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-toEBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&amp;T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.\n\n## Collateral Arrangements\n\nMost of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&amp;T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our $34,884 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During 2024, we received $477 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 12)\n\n## Other\n\nOur total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year), redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders' equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At December 31, 2024, our debt ratio was 50.7%, compared to 53.5% at December 31, 2023 and 56.1% at December 31, 2022. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests.",

      "question": "How did the conversion of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock between 2023 and 2024 impact the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock at CMCSA, and what does this suggest about the company's capital structure evolution?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA reported 4,842,108,959 issued Class A Common Stock shares, while in 2024, this number decreased to 4,651,093,045. Despite the conversion mechanism from Class B to Class A shares, the total issued shares of Class A decreased, indicating a net reduction likely due to buybacks or other corporate actions. This suggests a strategic tightening of the capital structure, even as the company maintained the one-for-one convertibility of Class B shares into Class A shares, a mechanism that typically increases Class A share issuance.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: In 2023, CMCSA disclosed that it had 9,444,375 issued and outstanding Class B shares.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis into Class A shares, though Class B stockholders are restricted from retaining ownership of Class A shares post-conversion.",

      "question": "How did Netflix's 2022 content licensing risks related to third-party providers influence its 2024 streaming content pricing strategy, particularly in light of the varying price ranges across countries?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix faced increasing risks related to content licensing, including rising programming costs and the potential withdrawal of content from third-party providers due to competitive pressures and exclusive rights negotiations. The 2022 filing explicitly noted that as content providers developed their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to license popular content on acceptable terms, which could impact Netflix\u2019s content mix and increase costs. By 2024, Netflix responded by implementing a tiered pricing model that ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $32 per month across different countries. This pricing flexibility suggests a strategic move to offset rising content acquisition costs and mitigate the impact of content unavailability by tailoring pricing to regional market conditions and consumer willingness to pay.",

As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

      "question": "How did Disney's use of foreign exchange option contracts as cash flow hedges for firm commitments change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about their foreign currency risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney had $8.3 billion in notional amounts of foreign exchange cash flow hedges, which increased to $9.9 billion in 2024. These hedges, which include option contracts, are used to protect the value of firm commitments and forecasted foreign currency transactions. The increase of $1.6 billion in hedge notional amounts suggests that Disney expanded its hedging activity in 2024, likely in response to greater foreign exchange exposure or more volatile currency markets. This indicates a more aggressive or expanded foreign currency risk management strategy in 2024 compared to 2023.",

        "Hop 1: DIS(2023) \u2192 Firm Commitments: Disney used foreign exchange hedges, including option contracts, to protect firm commitments in 2023, with a total notional amount of $8.3 billion.",
        "Hop 2: Firm Commitments \u2192 Option Contracts: Option contracts are specifically used to hedge firm commitments and forecasted foreign currency transactions, offsetting changes in the U.S. dollar value of these exposures.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, with $36.3 billion remaining available under the repurchase authorization by year-end. In 2024, the company repurchased $62.0 billion of shares, with $44.7 billion remaining available for repurchases. The automatic conversion provisions for Class B shares, which convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, likely contributed to increased availability of Class A shares for repurchase. This dynamic may have enabled more strategic retirements of Class A shares in 2024, as the conversion process effectively increased the pool of Class A shares in circulation without dilution of voting rights, supporting the company\u2019s repurchase and capital allocation strategy.",

      "question": "Given that Alphabet's 2024 share repurchases remained focused on Class A and Class C shares similar to 2023, and considering the conversion rules between stock classes, how did the continued absence of Class B share repurchases impact the relative ownership proportions of high-vote Class B shares between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "The continued absence of Class B share repurchases in 2024, similar to 2023, likely increased the relative proportion of high-vote Class B shares within Alphabet's capital structure. Since repurchases were limited to Class A and Class C shares in both years ($62.2 billion in 2023 and $62.0 billion in 2024), and Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, the lack of Class B repurchases meant that these higher-vote shares were not being retired at the same rate as Class A shares. This mirrors the pattern seen at Comcast, where Class B shares also held concentrated voting power and could convert to Class A shares.",

Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\n\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical,  except  with  respect  to  voting.  Furthermore,  there  are  a  number  of  safeguards  built  into  our  certificate  of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends  on  our  Class  A,  Class  B,  and  Class  C  stock.  Specifically,  Delaware  law  provides  that  amendments  to  our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that  before  any  such  amendment  may  be  put  to  a  stockholder  vote,  it  must  be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\n\n",

      "question": "Given the automatic conversion of Class B shares upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock, how did Alphabet balance maintaining voting control while executing large-scale repurchases of Class A shares in 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, and in 2024, it repurchased $62.0 billion, indicating a sustained focus on returning capital to shareholders. Class B shares, which carry 10 votes per share, automatically convert to Class A shares (1 vote per share) upon sale or transfer. This conversion mechanism creates a tension between maintaining voting control and enabling share repurchases at scale. Despite this, Alphabet managed to maintain flexibility by repurchasing shares while preserving its dual-class structure. The availability of $36.3 billion in 2023 and $44.7 billion in 2024 under the repurchase authorization shows the company's strategic intent to continue these programs without fully eroding its voting control base, as Class B shares not converted remained under control of key stakeholders.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA had 5,083,466,045 issued Class A common shares, which decreased to 4,842,108,959 in 2023. This reduction in issued shares could have increased the relative concentration of voting power among remaining Class A shareholders. Class A common stock collectively holds 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock holds 33 1/3%, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. Despite the decrease in issued Class A shares, the non-dilutable nature of Class B voting power ensures that Mr. Brian L. Roberts, the sole beneficial owner of Class B shares, maintains significant control. The change in Class A share issuance thus highlights a shift in shareholder structure that may have subtly altered the balance of influence within the broader shareholder base, while the Class B voting power remained structurally dominant.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney identified triggering events such as decreases in estimated future cash flows, which led to impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter. These assets were evaluated on a non-recurring basis using discounted future cash flow analysis, a Level 3 valuation technique. In 2024, similar triggering events occurred in the second and fourth quarters, again prompting impairment charges under the same non-recurring fair value measurement policy. However, the repeated use of Level 3 valuation in both years highlights a continued reliance on unobservable inputs due to market uncertainties affecting asset recoverability. This pattern indicates a sustained financial stress point across both fiscal years.",

        "Hop 1: DIS(2023) \u2192 Triggering Events: Disney disclosed that triggering events, such as decreases in estimated future cash flows, prompted impairment testing of long-lived assets in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Triggering Events \u2192 Non-Recurring Fair Value Measures: Triggering events are directly linked to the activation of non-recurring fair value measures, under which assets are valued using Level 3 techniques like discounted cash flow analysis.",

      "question": "How did Disney's approach to hedging forecasted transactions in 2022 compare with its use of the VAR model in 2024, particularly in terms of risk exposure metrics and excluded financial instruments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney actively used derivatives to hedge forecasted transactions as part of its risk management strategy, specifically targeting exposure to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. However, by 2024, the company's Value at Risk (VAR) model, which estimates the maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of its financial instruments, explicitly excluded forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and foreign currency-denominated receivables/payables from its calculations. This exclusion suggests a strategic shift in how Disney assessed and reported risk, focusing the VAR model only on realized financial instruments such as debt, derivatives, and equity investments. The VAR metric itself decreased from $284 million in 2023 to $255 million in 2024, indicating a reduction in measured risk exposure, which was attributed to lower interest rate volatility.",

By 2024, the company maintained this dual-class structure, but expanded its share repurchase program, repurchasing $62.0 billion worth of shares in that year alone. The voting rights structure, where Class A and Class B shares differed in voting power but had otherwise identical rights, remained unchanged, though Class B shares automatically converted to Class A upon sale or transfer. This structure likely allowed major shareholders to maintain control while the company pursued aggressive share buybacks in 2024, which totaled $62.0 billion for the year, as repurchases primarily targeted Class A and Class C shares, which have no voting rights, preserving the voting power of Class B holders.",

As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained av ailable for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\n\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock in 2023 evolve by 2024, and what implications did this have for shareholder control and equity structure at CMCSA?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Class B common stock was not yet issued, meaning the voting power was entirely concentrated in Class A common stock. By 2024, Class B common stock was issued with 15 votes per share, representing 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, while Class A common stock voting power was adjusted accordingly to 66\u2154%. This structural change introduced a dual-class system that concentrated voting control in the hands of the holder of Class B shares (Brian L. Roberts), despite a slight reduction in the number of issued Class A shares (from 4,842,108,959 in 2023 to 4,651,093,045 in 2024). The equity structure also reflected this shift, with Class A common stock value remaining stable at $47 million in 2024, down only slightly from $48 million in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class B shares were not yet issued in 2023, indicating a single-class equity structure.",

        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA(2024): In 2024, the number of issued Class A shares decreased slightly, and the equity value of Class A common stock was reported at $47 million, down from $48 million in 2023."

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class  B  common stock having 15 votes per share.  The  Class  B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock.

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney had $8.3 billion in notional amounts of foreign exchange cash flow hedges, which increased to $9.9 billion in 2024. This growth in hedging activity reflects a stronger financial commitment to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted foreign currency transactions. The increase in hedge coverage suggests Disney aimed to enhance its stability in earnings by reducing the volatility associated with global currency movements. This is further supported by the fact that mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and recognized in earnings when the hedged forecasted transactions occur, thereby smoothing financial performance over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS(2023) \u2192 Foreign Exchange Option Contracts: Disney designated foreign exchange option contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency transactions, with a notional amount of $8.3 billion as of September 30, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Foreign Exchange Option Contracts \u2192 Forecasted Transactions: These contracts were used to hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions, offsetting changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of those transactions.",
        "Hop 3: Forecasted Transactions \u2190 DIS(2024): By 2024, Disney increased the notional amount of these hedges to $9.9 billion, indicating a stronger hedge position to manage earnings volatility from forecasted foreign currency transactions."

      "question": "How did Disney's use of pay-fixed interest rate swaps in 2023 relate to the interest rate exposure on its floating-rate borrowings in 2024, and what does this imply about their interest rate risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney entered into pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings, effectively converting floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. However, by 2024, the company disclosed that it had no pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments, indicating a shift in strategy. In 2024, the interest rates on floating-rate borrowings reflected the rates in effect at that time, which may have exposed Disney to greater interest rate volatility compared to the prior year. This suggests a strategic decision to reduce the use of interest rate swaps, potentially increasing exposure to market rate fluctuations.",

      "question": "How did the strategic positioning of National Geographic within Disney's DTC ecosystem change between fiscal 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its branding integration and monetization dependency on Disney+ subscriber growth?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, National Geographic was fully integrated into the Disney+ interface as a top-level tile, directly contributing to the DTC ecosystem and subscriber value. By fiscal 2023, National Geographic magazine was moved to the Content Sales/Licensing segment, signaling a shift in its monetization model away from direct DTC subscription dependency. Despite this, National Geographic-branded programming remained a top-level tile on Disney+, indicating continued strategic importance to subscriber acquisition and retention. This dual positioning suggests a deliberate effort to leverage National Geographic's brand within the DTC platform while transitioning part of its revenue model to more traditional licensing and publishing streams.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nsuccessfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T disclosed that the Tower Preferred Interests were subject to reset in December 2024, with a September series (Class A-1) totaling $1,500 at 5.0% and a December series (Class A-2) totaling $4,500 at 4.75%. Holders had the option to require redemption upon contingent events, such as failure to pay distributions for two or more periods or a breach of credit rating requirements. By 2024, AT&T amended the Tower Preferred Interests in August 2024, effective November 2024, restructuring them into Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests) paying 5.90%, with a portion transitioning annually to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) at SOFR plus 250 basis points. The redemption terms were extended, allowing AT&T to call the Fixed Rate Interests starting in November 2029 and Floating Rate Interests at any time. This evolution provided AT&T with enhanced flexibility in managing its tower asset financing through a more structured and diversified interest rate profile, while maintaining the ability to redeem the interests under favorable conditions.",

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nAuthorized Shares We have authorized 14 billion common shares of AT&amp;T stock and 10 million preferred shares of AT&amp;T stock, each with a par value of $1.00 per share. Cumulative perpetual preferred shares consist of the following:\n\n- Series A: 48 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference and a dividend rate of 5.000%.\n- Series B: 20 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a \u20ac100,000 per share liquidation preference, and an initial rate of 2.875%, subject to reset after May 1, 2025.\n- Series C: 70 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference, and a dividend rate of 4.75%.\n\nSo long as the quarterly preferred dividends are declared and paid on a timely basis on each series of preferred shares, there are no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T common shares. The preferred shares are optionally redeemable by AT&amp;T at the liquidation price on or after five years from the issuance date, or upon certain other contingent events.\n\nStock Repurchase Program From time to time, we repurchase shares of common stock for distribution through our employee benefit plans or in connection with certain acquisitions. Our Board of Directors has approved the following authorization to repurchase common stock: (1) March 2013 authorization program of 300 million shares, which was completed in 2020 and (2) March 2014 authorization program for 300 million shares, with approximately 178 million outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n\nTo implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 142 million shares totaling $5,278 under the March 2013 and March 2014 authorizations. During 2021, there were no shares repurchased under the March 2014 authorization.\n\nDividend Declarations In December 2021 and December 2020, AT&amp;T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $36 and a quarterly common dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock.\n\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries We have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration. The preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Mobility II\n\nWe previously issued 320 million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), representing all currently outstanding Mobility preferred equity interests, which pay cash distributions of $560 per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions are declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred equity interests will not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares.\n\nA holder of the Mobility preferred interests may put the interests to Mobility II. Mobility II may redeem the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022. When either option arises due to a passage of time, that option may be exercised only during certain periods.\n\nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) twenty-five dollars ($8,000 in the aggregate) plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price may be paid with cash, AT&amp;T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&amp;T common stock, at Mobility II's sole election. In no event shall Mobility II be required to deliver more than 250 million shares of AT&amp;T common stock to settle put and redemption options. We have the intent and ability to settle the Mobility preferred equity interests with cash.\n\n## Tower Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.",

These preferred interests were redeemed on November 6, 2020. (See Note 6)\n\nThe membership interests in PR Holdings consisted of (1) common interests, which were held by consolidated subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (PR preferred interests). The PR preferred interests paid an initial preferred distribution at an annual rate of 4.75%. Distributions were paid quarterly, subject to declaration.\n\n## NOTE 18. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and a deferred purchase price, and (2) revolving service and trade receivables. Under these programs, we transfer receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, where applicable. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to 'Total Assets' reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash receipts on the deferred purchase price are classified as cash flows from investing activities.",

The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&amp;T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\n## Tower Holdings Preferred Interests\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the '2019 Tower preferred interests'). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fix ed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the 'Tower preferred interests') would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC Preferred Interests\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $7,250 (collectively the 'Telco preferred interests').\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consists of (1) members' interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years from the issuance date. The Telco preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating.

      "question": "How did the increase in content licensing costs from 2022 to 2024, driven by strained relationships with content providers, impact NFLX's strategy around original content investment and profitability targets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NFLX emphasized expanding its global streaming membership base within operating margin targets, with a focus on content that delights members and attracts new ones. However, by 2024, NFLX faced rising content licensing costs due to strained relationships with content providers, who were increasingly unwilling to license popular content on favorable terms. This led NFLX to shift focus toward original content production, which is reflected in their increased investment in original programming to maintain a compelling content mix. This strategic pivot was necessary to mitigate the rising costs and risks associated with third-party licensing, directly influencing their profitability targets as content amortization and production costs rose.",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- our relationship with third-party service providers for the management, operation, sale and technology to support advertisements on our service;\n- our ability to develop and expand an advertising sales and advertising technology organization team;\n- our ability to develop the technology and related infrastructure to support advertising and drive value to advertisers;\n- the impact of our content and reputation on advertisers' willingness to spend with us; and\n- any member dissatisfaction due to advertisements.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content prov iders or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

By 2023, although the voting rights per share remained structurally unchanged (Class A: 1 vote, Class B: 10 votes), the actual distribution of influence likely shifted due to the $62.2 billion in share repurchases during the year, which primarily targeted Class A and Class C shares.

The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "question": "How did CMCSA's Class B Common Stock voting structure change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this mean for shareholder governance?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA had 9,444,375 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, which carried conditional voting rights for specific corporate actions, such as exiting the core payments business, mergers, or certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation. These rights were distinct from Class A Common Stock, which held full voting rights on all matters. However, by 2024, Class B Common Stock was no longer listed in the equity section of the balance sheet, indicating that these shares were either retired or fully converted into another class of shares. This structural change effectively removed the separate voting rights associated with Class B shares, consolidating voting power under Class A shareholders. As a result, Class A shareholders now have more influence over corporate governance decisions without the counterbalance of Class B voting rights.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA disclosed 9,444,375 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding in 2023, with conditional voting rights.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: Class B shares had no voting rights except for specific corporate actions, such as exiting the core payments business or mergers.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 CMCSA(2024): By 2024, Class B Common Stock was no longer listed in the equity section, indicating its removal or conversion, thereby altering the voting structure."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, holders of Class A common stock collectively held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3%, with each share of Class B common stock carrying 15 votes. The 2023 filing shows that Class B common stock remained outstanding with 9,444,375 shares, and there was no indication that the voting rights structure or the non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power allocation for Class B shares had changed. This indicates that the governance control framework, particularly the voting power split, remained unchanged between 2022 and 2023, preserving the structural influence of Class B shareholders.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the redemption options for the Tower Preferred Interests could be triggered upon contingent events such as failure to pay distributions for two or more periods or failure to meet a minimum credit rating. Redemption could be settled in cash, AT&T common stock, or a combination, at the subsidiary\u2019s sole election, with a cap of 250 million shares of AT&T stock. By 2023, these terms remained largely unchanged, but the context shifted as AT&T repurchased all outstanding Mobility preferred interests (which had similar redemption features), signaling a strategic move to reduce contingent liabilities. This suggests a more cautious approach to managing redemption risks tied to preferred equity instruments, even as the formal redemption terms for Tower Preferred Interests remained intact.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: T(2022) \u2192 Redemption Option: Discloses redemption terms for preferred equity, including put and redemption rights tied to contingent events and settlement flexibility.",
        "Hop 2: Redemption Option \u2192 Tower Preferred Interests: The redemption terms are subject to contingent events such as failure to pay distributions or credit rating changes, with settlement options in cash or stock.",
        "Hop 3: Tower Preferred Interests \u2190 T(2023): Discloses continuation of the same redemption structure but within a broader context where AT&T proactively repurchased similar Mobility preferred interests, indicating a shift in strategic posture."

Our Board of Directors has approved the following authorization to repurchase common stock: (1) March 2013 authorization program of 300 million shares, which was completed in 2020 and (2) March 2014 authorization program for 300 million shares, with approximately 178 million outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n\nTo implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2020, we repurchased approximately 142 million shares totaling $5,278 under the March 2013 and March 2014 authorizations. During 2021, there were no shares repurchased under the March 2014 authorization.\n\nDividend Declarations In December 2021 and December 2020, AT&amp;T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $36 and a quarterly common dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock.\n\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries We have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration. The preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Mobility II\n\nWe previously issued 320 million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), representing all currently outstanding Mobility preferred equity interests, which pay cash distributions of $560 per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions are declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred equity interests will not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares.\n\nA holder of the Mobility preferred interests may put the interests to Mobility II. Mobility II may redeem the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022. When either option arises due to a passage of time, that option may be exercised only during certain periods.\n\nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) twenty-five dollars ($8,000 in the aggregate) plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price may be paid with cash, AT&amp;T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&amp;T common stock, at Mobility II's sole election. In no event shall Mobility II be required to deliver more than 250 million shares of AT&amp;T common stock to settle put and redemption options. We have the intent and ability to settle the Mobility preferred equity interests with cash.\n\n## Tower Holdings\n\nIn 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.",

The September series (Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals $1,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and the December series (Class A-2) totals $4,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning five years from the issuance date or upon the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the underlying assets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&amp;T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Telco LLC\n\nIn September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunication-related assets.\n\nMembers' equity in Telco LLC consist of (1) member's interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (Telco preferred interests), which pay an initial preferred distribution of 4.25% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every seven years. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&amp;T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning seven years from the issuance date.\n\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating.

These preferred interests were redeemed on November 6, 2020. (See Note 6)\n\nThe membership interests in PR Holdings consisted of (1) common interests, which were held by consolidated subsidiaries of AT&amp;T, and (2) preferred interests (PR preferred interests). The PR preferred interests paid an initial preferred distribution at an annual rate of 4.75%. Distributions were paid quarterly, subject to declaration.\n\n## NOTE 18. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\n\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and a deferred purchase price, and (2) revolving service and trade receivables. Under these programs, we transfer receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, where applicable. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to bill and collect the payments from our customers on behalf of the financial institutions.\n\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to 'Total Assets' reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash receipts on the deferred purchase price are classified as cash flows from investing activities.",

In no event was Mobility II required to deliver more than 250 million shares of AT&T common stock to settle put and redemption options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| On October 24, 2022, approximately 105 million Mobility preferred interests were put to AT&T by a third-party investor, for which we paid approximately $2,600 cash to redeem. On December 27, 2022, the AT&T pension trust provided written notice of its right to require us to purchase the remaining 213 million, or approximately $5,340, of Mobility preferred interests outstanding. The terms of the instruments limited the amount we were required to redeem in any 12-month period to approximately 107 million shares, or $2,670. With the certainty of redemption, the Mobility preferred interests were reclassified from equity to a liability at fair value, with approximately $2,670 recorded in current liabilities as 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities,' representing the amount required to be redeemed within one year, and $2,670 recorded in 'Other noncurrent liabilities.' The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Notes 12 and 14). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interest for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414. |\n| Tower Holdings Preferred Interests In 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the 'Tower preferred interests'). The September series (Tower Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals $1,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and the December series (Tower Class A-2) totals $4,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning five years from the issuance date or upon the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the underlying assets.

      "answer": "GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and $62.0 billion in 2024, indicating sustained buyback activity concentrated in non-voting (Class C) and single-vote (Class A) shares. Given that Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, the continued large-scale repurchase of Class A shares\u2014without corresponding Class B repurchases\u2014may have preserved or even increased the relative voting power of Class B shares within the overall equity structure. This dynamic mirrors the dual-class voting power framework seen in companies like CMCSA, where a smaller number of Class B shares retain a disproportionately large share of total voting rights due to their per-share vote multiplier.",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stockholders at META evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what implications did this have for shareholder influence and corporate governance?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Class B common stockholders held 33 1/3% of the combined voting power at META, with each share carrying 15 votes, while Class A common stockholders held the remaining 66 2/3%. By 2024, the total number of outstanding shares had changed, with 2,189,898,148 shares of Class A and 343,761,117 shares of Class B common stock, which likely preserved the non-dilutable 15:1 voting power ratio per share. This structure continued to concentrate significant governance control with the holders of Class B shares, despite the much larger number of Class A shares outstanding. The introduction of a dividend policy in 2024, applying equally to both classes, added a new financial incentive for both groups, potentially influencing strategic alignment between the two classes.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney disclosed floating-rate borrowings with a net premium of $1.8 billion and a market-value adjustment of $1.8 billion, indicating significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations. While the company had the capacity to use pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure\u2014effectively converting floating-rate debt to fixed-rate\u2014no such swaps were designated as cash flow hedges at the end of fiscal 2023. This pattern continued into 2024, where despite a slightly lower net premium of $1.6 billion and a reduced market-value adjustment of $0.9 billion, Disney still did not employ pay-fixed interest rate swaps as hedges. As a result, the company's interest expense in 2024 was directly exposed to prevailing floating rates without mitigation through fixed-rate swaps, suggesting a strategic decision to accept interest rate volatility or rely on other risk management tools.",

The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the change in the outstanding balance of the line of credit provided by Shendi to Shanghai Disney Resort between 2022 and 2023 reflect the evolving financial partnership between Disney and Shendi?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the line of credit provided by Shendi to Shanghai Disney Resort had an outstanding balance of 1.2 billion yuan (approximately $162 million), but by 2023, this balance had dropped to zero. This shift indicates a change in the financial dynamics of the partnership, potentially signaling improved liquidity or a strategic decision to reduce debt exposure. The continued provision of long-term loans by Shendi, totaling 8.6 billion yuan in 2023, suggests sustained support despite the change in short-term credit utilization.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META's 10-K highlighted that its dual-class structure, where Class B shares held non-dilutable voting power, could depress stock prices and limit shareholder influence over governance decisions. The structure required a majority of Class B shares to approve change-of-control transactions until they fell below 35% of total voting power. In 2024, META disclosed 343,761,117 Class B shares outstanding, each carrying significant voting rights, maintaining concentrated control. The CMCSA evidence clarifies that Class B shares typically hold a non-dilutable 33\u2153% of voting power, with each Class B share entitled to 15 votes, directly linking the structural mechanics to the continued governance imbalance. This shows that despite potential shifts in ownership percentages, META's 2023 governance risks persisted in 2024 through sustained board control and limited shareholder influence.",

      "answer": "The significant stock-based compensation (SBC) awards tied to Class C shares in 2023 ($21.7 billion of the $22.1 billion total SBC expense) likely contributed to an increase in the number of outstanding Class C shares through RSU vesting. Since all share classes have identical per-share dividend rights (as stated in both 2023 and 2024 filings), the increased number of Class C shares would have resulted in a higher total dividend payout to Class C shareholders in 2024. This aligns with the 2024 disclosure showing $3.3 billion in dividends paid to Class C shareholders, compared to $3.5 billion for Class A and $519 million for Class B, despite equal per-share amounts. The connection between SBC awards in 2023 and dividend distributions in 2024 demonstrates how equity compensation directly affects capital structure and shareholder returns over time.",

      "answer": "Alphabet's share repurchase strategy, which focused exclusively on Class A and Class C shares, reduced the total number of Class A shares outstanding while leaving Class B shares untouched. In 2023, $62.2 billion in shares were repurchased, followed by $62.0 billion in 2024. Since Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, but were not subject to repurchase, this strategy effectively preserved the high-vote Class B structure while reducing the overall Class A voting float. As a result, the relative voting power of Class B shareholders increased compared to Class A shareholders, as fewer Class A shares remained in circulation without a corresponding reduction in Class B shares. This dynamic reinforces control concentration among long-term shareholders who hold Class B shares.",

By 2023, the voting power structure remained unchanged, but the total number of shares was affected by repurchases: in 2023, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, reducing the total share count and potentially concentrating voting power among remaining shareholders.

This structure discouraged potential takeovers and could have made Class A shares less attractive to investors. The conversion mechanism allowed Class B shares to convert on a one-for-one basis into Class A shares, but Class B holders were restricted from retaining Class A shares post-conversion, reinforcing the dual-class governance structure. By 2024, the 10-K filing showed that there were still 343,761,117 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, representing a significant portion of voting power, indicating that the control dynamics had not materially shifted from 2023 to 2024 despite potential investor concerns.",

      "question": "How did the change in Disney's equity investment relationship with A&E between 2023 and 2024 affect its strategic partnership dynamics with Hearst, particularly in terms of subscriber base growth and international content distribution reach?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney held a 50% ownership stake in A+E Networks, a joint venture with Hearst, which operated channels like A&E, HISTORY, and Lifetime, each reaching 58 million domestic subscribers. By 2024, A+E maintained the same subscriber count but expanded its programming availability to approximately 200 countries and territories. This international reach likely strengthened Disney\u2019s strategic partnership with Hearst, as A+E became a key vehicle for distributing Disney's content globally, especially through general entertainment and family channels operating in 175 countries. The stable ownership structure and growing international footprint suggest a deepened collaboration between Disney and Hearst to leverage A+E\u2019s platform for global content delivery.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Class A common stockholders held 66\u2154% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders held 33\u2153%, with Class B shares carrying 15 votes per share. In 2023, Class B shares were reduced to carrying 10 votes per share, potentially altering the balance of control. Additionally, GOOGL repurchased $59.3 billion in shares in 2022 and $62.2 billion in 2023, which may have disproportionately affected Class A and Class C shares, but not Class B, further concentrating voting power. This evolution reflects a structural shift in governance and shareholder influence.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META's 10:1 voting power disparity between Class A and Class B shares raised concerns about governance risks, potentially harming investor confidence in Class A shares. By 2024, despite continued structural governance constraints tied to the dual-class system, META maintained a significant share repurchase program, repurchasing $62.0 billion of shares (including both Class A and Class B). However, the persistent imbalance in voting rights, with 343,761,117 Class B shares outstanding at the end of 2024, suggests that governance risks remained largely unchanged. The repurchase strategy may reflect an effort to consolidate ownership while maintaining control, but the unchanged voting structure likely continued to weigh on Class A investor sentiment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney maintained a strategic partnership with FYI, which had 42 million domestic subscribers and was explicitly part of A+E Networks, a joint venture in which Disney held a 50% ownership stake. A+E Networks also included other channels like A&E, HISTORY, and Lifetime.

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney participated in multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements that included specific eligibility requirements for employee participation, with contributions expensed as incurred.

As a result, while the fundamental structure of Disney's participation and associated risks remained consistent between years, the evidence does not provide specific data to indicate a material change in contribution obligations or risk exposure directly tied to eligibility modifications.",

      "question": "How did the shift in stock repurchase focus from Class A and Class C shares in 2023 to Class C share reserve allocations in 2024 reflect changes in Alphabet's equity strategy, particularly in relation to the treatment of Class B and Class C stock under the two-class earnings allocation method?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alphabet's repurchase strategy included both Class A and Class C shares, with repurchases executed based on market conditions and economic cost, while also emphasizing that all share classes (Class A, B, and C) received equal per-share dividends due to legal and structural safeguards. The two-class method of earnings allocation ensured that net income per share was identical across all classes, as they had identical liquidation and dividend rights. By 2024, the focus had evolved, with 633 million shares of Class C stock specifically reserved for future issuance under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan, signaling a strategic emphasis on Class C shares for equity compensation. This shift aligns with the growing importance of RSUs, which are settled in Class C shares and reflect increased stock-based compensation expenses ($22.0 billion in 2024, up from $21.7 billion in 2023). The continued alignment of dividend and liquidation rights between Class B and Class C shares ensured that earnings allocation remained proportionate, even as the company's equity issuance and repurchase strategies evolved.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL(2023) \u2192 Class B Stock: In 2023, Alphabet repurchased Class A and Class C shares, with equal dividend and liquidation rights across all classes, and used the two-class method for earnings allocation.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Stock \u2192 Class C Stock: Both share classes were treated equally under the two-class earnings allocation method, with identical dividend and liquidation rights.",
        "Hop 3: Class C Stock \u2190 GOOGL(2024): In 2024, 633 million Class C shares were reserved for future RSU issuances under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan, with RSUs being settled in Class C shares and contributing to rising stock-based compensation expenses."

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock at CMCSA change from 2022 to 2024, and what does this imply about the stability of Brian L. Roberts' control over corporate decisions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Class A common stockholders held 66\u2154% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock, beneficially owned entirely by Brian L. Roberts, represented 33\u2153% of the voting power with 15 votes per share. By 2024, the issued and outstanding shares of Class A increased from 4,651,093,045 (2022) to 4,842,108,959 (2024), while Class B shares remained constant at 9,444,375. This suggests that although the total number of Class A shares increased, the non-dilutable nature of Class B voting rights ensured that Roberts\u2019 control remained stable, preserving his influence over corporate governance despite potential dilution in Class A voting concentration.",
