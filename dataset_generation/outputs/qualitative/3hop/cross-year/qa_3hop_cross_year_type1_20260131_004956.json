      "question": "How did the financial impact of AMT's acquisition of CoreSite in 2023, which included 24 data center facilities, evolve into changes in the structure and reporting of the Data Centers segment in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMT completed the acquisition of CoreSite for $10.4 billion, which included 24 data center facilities across eight U.S. markets, integrating them into the Data Centers segment. By 2024, AMT had restructured its reportable segments, separating U.S. & Canada property from the broader property segments and maintaining the Data Centers segment as a distinct reporting unit. This evolution reflects a strategic emphasis on the data center business post-acquisition, allowing for more transparent performance tracking of the integrated CoreSite assets.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and ex penses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates' below.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we completed the sale of ATC TIPL. The divestiture qualified for presentation as discontinued operations. See Note 22 for further discussion. Prior to the divestiture and classification as discontinued operations, ATC TIPL's operating results were included within the Asia-Pacific property segment. Historical financial information included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the operating results of ATC TIPL as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we also completed the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our APAC property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now report our results in six  segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Historical financial information included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 and includes our U.S. &amp; Canada property, Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment.\n\nWe also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.",

During this review, AMT recorded a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge for its India reporting unit due to the carrying value exceeding fair value. In 2024, the transaction with DIT culminated in the sale of ATC TIPL for approximately $2.2 billion, resulting in a $1.2 billion loss, which included a $1.1 billion reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2023, the Company undertook a strategic review of its India operations, where the Company evaluated the appropriate level of exposure to the India market within its global portfolio of communications assets, and assessed opportunities to repurpose capital to drive long-term shareholder value and sustained growth. The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below).\n\nOn January 4, 2024, the Company, through ATC TIPL, entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust ('DIT'), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the 'ATC TIPL Transaction'). Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration represented up to approximately 210 billion Indian Rupees ('INR') (approximately $2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed in note 11), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of the Company's existing term loan in India, by DIT.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately 29.6 billion INR (approximately $354.1 million) to the Company, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction of the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by the Company at closing.\n\nThe ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). The Company used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of $1.2 billion, which primarily included the reclassification of the Company's cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $1.1 billion. The loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties and classified them as temporary equity due to the potential for redemption in cash, with adjustments made to the carrying amount based on redemption value. By 2024, the redemption option remained available to limited partners in the Operating Partnership, who could exchange units for cash or shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis, with the cash amount based on the trading price of SPG common stock. SPG maintained the ability to determine whether redemptions were settled in cash or stock, but if cash was selected and insufficient funds were available, the exchange would default to stock. This evolution shows a continued emphasis on flexibility in redemption settlement while maintaining the temporary equity classification due to the contingent cash redemption risk.",

Simon Property Group, L.P.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)\n\nmillion.  In 2020, Simon issued 293,204 shares of common stock to 20 limited partners of the Operating Partnership in exchange for an equal number of units pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed 116,658 units from four limited partners for $16.1 million.  These transactions increased Simon's ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.\n\nOn December 29, 2020, the Operating Partnership issued 955,705 units in connection with the acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in TRG, as discussed in Note 6.\n\nOn  November  18,  2020,  we  issued  22,137,500  shares  of  common  stock  in  a  public  offering  at  a  price  of $72.50  per  share,  before  underwriting  discounts  and  commissions.    The  Operating  Partnership  issued  an  equal number of units to Simon.  A portion of the $1.6 billion proceeds from the offering, net of issue costs, were used to fund the Operating Partnership's acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in TRG.\n\nOn  February  13,  2017,  Simon's  Board  of  Directors  authorized  a  two-year  extension  of  the  previously authorized  $2.0  billion  common  stock  repurchase  plan  through  March  31,  2019.    On  February  11,  2019,  Simon's Board  of  Directors  authorized  a  new  common  stock  repurchase  plan.    Under  the  plan,  Simon  was  authorized  to repurchase  up  to  $2.0  billion  of  its  common  stock  during  the  two-year  period  ending  February  11,  2021.    The Repurchase Program was not extended.  Simon repurchased the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  as  market  conditions  warranted.    During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  Simon  purchased 1,245,654  shares  at  an  average  price  of  $122.50  per  share.    During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2019,  Simon purchased 2,247,074 shares at an average price of $160.11 per share, of which 46,377 shares at an average price of $164.49 were purchased as part of the previous program.  As Simon repurchased shares under this program, the Operating Partnership repurchased an equal number of units from Simon.\n\n## Temporary Equity\n\n## Simon\n\nSimon classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that Simon could be required  to  redeem  the  security  for  cash  irrespective  of  the  probability  of  such  a  possibility.  As  a  result,  Simon classifies  one  series  of  preferred  units  in  the  Operating  Partnership  and  noncontrolling  redeemable  interests  in properties in temporary equity. Each of these securities is discussed further below.\n\nLimited  Partners'  Preferred  Interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership  and  Noncontrolling  Redeemable Interests  in  Properties. The  redemption  features  of  the  preferred  units  in  the  Operating  Partnership  contain provisions which could require the Operating Partnership to settle the redemption in cash. As a result, this series of preferred units in the Operating Partnership remains classified outside permanent equity.\n\nThe remaining  noncontrolling  interests  in  a  property  or  portfolio  of  properties  which  are  redeemable  at  the option of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside Simon's control, are accounted for as temporary equity. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to the redemption amount assuming the instrument is redeemable at the balance sheet date. Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded and presented within accumulated deficit in the consolidated statements of equity in the line issuance of unit equivalents and other. There were no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The",

This was consistent with AMT being in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2024, suggesting that the company had refined its securitization strategy to better manage liquidity and reduce default risk, particularly in light of the increased reserve requirements and trustee oversight.",

The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.\n\nFailure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.\n\nRestrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust SecuritizationsThe indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the 'Series 2015-2 Notes') issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC ('GTP Acquisition Partners') in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations.

      "answer": "In 2023, SPG invested in SPARC Group and received $101.8 million in lease income from its retailers, including SPARC Group and J.C. Penney. By 2024, SPG's investment evolved as J.C. Penney acquired SPARC Group's retail operations, which was renamed Catalyst Brands. This led to SPG recognizing a non-cash pre-tax gain of $100.5 million and retaining a 31.3% noncontrolling interest in Catalyst.

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.\n\nWe consolidate properties that are wholly-owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control. Control  of  a  property  is  demonstrated  by,  among  other  factors,  our  ability  to  refinance  debt  and  sell  the  property without the consent of any other partner or owner and the inability of any other partner or owner to replace us.\n\nWe also consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to  receive  benefits  of  the  VIE  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  the  VIE.  Our  determination  of  the  primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements and other contractual arrangements. There have been no changes during 2021 in previous conclusions about whether an entity qualifies  as  a  VIE  or  whether  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary  of  any  previously  identified  VIE.  During  the  periods presented, we did not provide financial or other support to any identified VIE that we were not contractually obligated to provide.\n\nInvestments in partnerships and joint ventures represent our noncontrolling ownership interests. We account for these unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting. We initially record these investments at cost and we subsequently adjust for net equity in income or loss, which we allocate in accordance with the provisions of the  applicable  partnership  or  joint  venture  agreement,  cash  contributions  and  distributions,  and  foreign  currency fluctuations,  if  applicable.  The  allocation  provisions  in  the  partnership  or  joint  venture  agreements  are  not  always consistent with the legal ownership interests held by each general or limited partner or joint venture investee primarily due  to  partner  preferences.  We  separately  report  investments  in  partnerships  and  joint  ventures  for  which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and our share of net income of the partnerships and joint ventures within cash distributions and losses in partnerships and joint ventures, at equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The net equity of certain partnerships and joint ventures is less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that are usually greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we consolidated 131 wholly-owned properties and 17 additional properties that are less than wholly-owned, but which we control or for which we are the primary beneficiary. We apply the equity method of  accounting  to  the  other  84  properties  (the  joint  venture  properties)  and  our  investments  in  Kl\u00e9pierre  (a  publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company) and The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, as well as our investments in  certain  entities  involved  in  retail  operations,  such  as  J.C.  Penney  and  SPARC  Group;  intellectual  property  and licensing  ventures,  such  as  Authentic  Brands  Group,  LLC,  or  ABG,  and  Eddie  Bauer  Ipco;  and  an  e-commerce venture  Rue  Gilt  Groupe,  or  RGG,  (collectively,  our  other  platform  investments).    We  manage  the  day-to-day operations of 53 of the 84 joint venture properties, but have determined that our partner or partners have substantive participating rights with respect to the assets and operations of these joint venture properties. Our investments in joint ventures in Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Canada, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom comprise 23 of the  remaining  31  properties.  These  international  properties  and  TRG  are  managed  by  joint  ventures  in  which  we share control.\n\nPreferred distributions of the Operating Partnership are accrued at declaration and represent distributions on outstanding preferred units of partnership interests, or preferred units, and are included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  We allocate net operating results of the Operating Partnership after preferred distributions to limited partners and to us based on the partners' respective weighted average ownership interests in the Operating Partnership.  Net  operating  results  of  the  Operating  Partnership  attributable  to  limited  partners  are  reflected  in  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.",

As a result of the redemption, the Company's controlling interest in ATC TIPL increased from 63% to 79% and the noncontrolling interest decreased from 37% to 21%.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company redeemed 100% of Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons' remaining combined holdings of ATC TIPL, for total consideration of INR 24.8 billion ($337.3 million at the date of redemption). As a result of the redemption, the Company's controlling interest in ATC TIPL increased from 79% to 92% and the noncontrolling interest decreased from 21% to 8%.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company redeemed 100% of Macquarie's combined holdings in ATC TIPL, for total consideration of INR 12.9 billion (approximately $173.2 million at the date of redemption). The redemption is reflected in the consolidated statements of equity as (i) an increase in Additional Paid-in Capital of $84.2 million and (ii) an increase in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $46.3 million. As a result of the redemption, the Company now holds a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL.\n\nOther Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests -During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of MTN Group Limited's noncontrolling interests in each of the Company's joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $524.4 million, including a net adjustment of $1.4 million made during the three months ended March 31, 2020, which resulted in an increase in the Company's controlling interests in such joint ventures from 51% to 100%. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company, through a subsidiary of ATC Europe, entered into an agreement with its local partners in France to form Eure-et-Loir R\u00e9seaux Mobiles SAS ('Eure-et-Loir'), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owned and operated wireless communications towers in France. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company liquidated its interests in Eure-et-Loir for total consideration of 2.2 million EUR (approximately $2.5 million at the date of redemption).\n\nThe changes in Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT's excess cash distribution from GTP Acquisition Partners was subject to the Cash Trap DSCR threshold of 1.30x, which, if breached, would restrict distributions and deposit excess cash into a reserve account. By 2023, GTP Acquisition Partners had a DSCR of 17.42x, well above the 1.30x threshold, enabling $322.1 million in excess cash to be distributed to AMT. This improvement in DSCR, combined with the completion of the 2023 Securitization, which refinanced $1.3 billion in Series 2013-2A Notes, reflects a strengthening in AMT's securitization structure and cash flow management, allowing for greater liquidity to be passed through to the parent company.",

The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs' interests in 5,113 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the 'Trust Sites').\n\nThe component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (the 'Loan Agreement').

The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of 3.652% and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of 4.459%. The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components.\n\nThe Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs' personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs' rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the 'Guarantor'), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations.\n\nUnder the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable, including interest payments, subject to the conditions described below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company.\n\nIn order to distribute any excess cash flow to the Company, the AMT Asset Subs and GTP Acquisition Partners must each maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (the 'DSCR'), which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. If the DSCR were equal to or below 1.30x (the 'Cash Trap DSCR') for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the 'Cash Trap Reserve Account') instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG held an investment in J.C. Penney, which was part of its broader portfolio of retail-related equity investments. By 2024, J.C. Penney had acquired the retail operations of SPARC Group, which SPG had previously invested in, and was subsequently renamed Catalyst Brands. As a result of this transaction, SPG\u2019s indirect exposure to SPARC Group through J.C. Penney transitioned into a direct 31.3% noncontrolling interest in Catalyst Brands and a continuing 33.3% interest in SPARC Holdings, which now holds a 25% stake in Catalyst. This evolution reflects a strategic shift in SPG\u2019s involvement in the retail operations segment, moving from indirect exposure via J.C. Penney to a more direct but reduced ownership position in the restructured entity by 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Simon Property Group, Inc.\n\n## Simon Property Group, L.P.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts\n\nand where indicated as in millions or billions)\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.\n\nWe consolidate properties that are wholly-owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control. Control  of  a  property  is  demonstrated  by,  among  other  factors,  our  ability  to  refinance  debt  and  sell  the  property without the consent of any other partner or owner and the inability of any other partner or owner to replace us.\n\nWe also consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to  receive  benefits  of  the  VIE  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  the  VIE.  Our  determination  of  the  primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements and other contractual arrangements. There have been no changes during 2021 in previous conclusions about whether an entity qualifies  as  a  VIE  or  whether  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary  of  any  previously  identified  VIE.  During  the  periods presented, we did not provide financial or other support to any identified VIE that we were not contractually obligated to provide.\n\nInvestments in partnerships and joint ventures represent our noncontrolling ownership interests. We account for these unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting. We initially record these investments at cost and we subsequently adjust for net equity in income or loss, which we allocate in accordance with the provisions of the  applicable  partnership  or  joint  venture  agreement,  cash  contributions  and  distributions,  and  foreign  currency fluctuations,  if  applicable.  The  allocation  provisions  in  the  partnership  or  joint  venture  agreements  are  not  always consistent with the legal ownership interests held by each general or limited partner or joint venture investee primarily due  to  partner  preferences.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG held an investment in SPARC Group, which was part of its broader portfolio of retail-related platform investments. By 2024, SPG's earlier involvement with SPARC Group intersected with its investment in J.C. Penney when J.C. Penney acquired SPARC Group in an all-equity transaction, forming Catalyst. As a result of this transaction, SPG's stake transitioned into a 31.3% noncontrolling interest in Catalyst. This evolution in investment structure directly influenced SPG's financial relationship with the combined entity, as evidenced by the $100.5 million non-cash pre-tax gain recognized from the transaction. Furthermore, SPG reported $105.9 million in lease income from Catalyst in 2024, up from $83.8 million in 2022, showing a clear financial impact of the strategic evolution of its involvement with SPARC Group and J.C.

Control  of  a  property  is  demonstrated  by,  among  other  factors,  our  ability  to  refinance  debt  and  sell  the  property without the consent of any other partner or owner and the inability of any other partner or owner to replace us.\n\nWe also consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to  receive  benefits  of  the  VIE  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  the  VIE.  Our  determination  of  the  primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements and other contractual arrangements. There have been no changes during 2021 in previous conclusions about whether an entity qualifies  as  a  VIE  or  whether  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary  of  any  previously  identified  VIE.  During  the  periods presented, we did not provide financial or other support to any identified VIE that we were not contractually obligated to provide.\n\nInvestments in partnerships and joint ventures represent our noncontrolling ownership interests. We account for these unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting. We initially record these investments at cost and we subsequently adjust for net equity in income or loss, which we allocate in accordance with the provisions of the  applicable  partnership  or  joint  venture  agreement,  cash  contributions  and  distributions,  and  foreign  currency fluctuations,  if  applicable.

By 2024, the transaction closed, and AMT received 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). The proceeds were used to repay $1.5 billion in senior notes in early 2024, including $500 million of 0.600% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.00% notes. This indicates a strategic shift to reduce debt and improve liquidity, despite recording a $1.2 billion loss on the sale.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG held a 33.3% noncontrolling interest in SPARC Group, which had a strategic partnership with ABG as Reebok's core licensee and operating partner in the U.S. During 2023, SPARC Group issued equity to a third party, diluting SPG's ownership and triggering a deemed disposal gain of $145.8 million. Concurrently, SPG's stake in ABG decreased from 12.3% in early 2023 to 9.6% by year-end due to multiple capital transactions, resulting in additional gains totaling $59.1 million. These changes reflect SPG's evolving investment strategy, with financial benefits realized through non-cash gains, despite reducing its exposure to both SPARC Group and ABG.",

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.\n\nWe consolidate properties that are wholly-owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control. Control  of  a  property  is  demonstrated  by,  among  other  factors,  our  ability  to  refinance  debt  and  sell  the  property without the consent of any other partner or owner and the inability of any other partner or owner to replace us.\n\nWe also consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to  receive  benefits  of  the  VIE  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  the  VIE.  Our  determination  of  the  primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements and other contractual arrangements. There have been no changes during 2021 in previous conclusions about whether an entity qualifies  as  a  VIE  or  whether  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary  of  any  previously  identified  VIE.  During  the  periods presented, we did not provide financial or other support to any identified VIE that we were not contractually obligated to provide.\n\nInvestments in partnerships and joint ventures represent our noncontrolling ownership interests. We account for these unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting. We initially record these investments at cost and we subsequently adjust for net equity in income or loss, which we allocate in accordance with the provisions of the  applicable  partnership  or  joint  venture  agreement,  cash  contributions  and  distributions,  and  foreign  currency fluctuations,  if  applicable.  The  allocation  provisions  in  the  partnership  or  joint  venture  agreements  are  not  always consistent with the legal ownership interests held by each general or limited partner or joint venture investee primarily due  to  partner  preferences.  We  separately  report  investments  in  partnerships  and  joint  ventures  for  which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and our share of net income of the partnerships and joint ventures within cash distributions and losses in partnerships and joint ventures, at equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The net equity of certain partnerships and joint ventures is less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that are usually greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we consolidated 131 wholly-owned properties and 17 additional properties that are less than wholly-owned, but which we control or for which we are the primary beneficiary. We apply the equity method of  accounting  to  the  other  84  properties  (the  joint  venture  properties)  and  our  investments  in  Kl\u00e9pierre  (a  publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company) and The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, as well as our investments in  certain  entities  involved  in  retail  operations,  such  as  J.C.  Penney  and  SPARC  Group;  intellectual  property  and licensing  ventures,  such  as  Authentic  Brands  Group,  LLC,  or  ABG,  and  Eddie  Bauer  Ipco;  and  an  e-commerce venture  Rue  Gilt  Groupe,  or  RGG,  (collectively,  our  other  platform  investments).    We  manage  the  day-to-day operations of 53 of the 84 joint venture properties, but have determined that our partner or partners have substantive participating rights with respect to the assets and operations of these joint venture properties. Our investments in joint ventures in Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Canada, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom comprise 23 of the  remaining  31  properties.  These  international  properties  and  TRG  are  managed  by  joint  ventures  in  which  we share control.\n\nPreferred distributions of the Operating Partnership are accrued at declaration and represent distributions on outstanding preferred units of partnership interests, or preferred units, and are included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  We allocate net operating results of the Operating Partnership after preferred distributions to limited partners and to us based on the partners' respective weighted average ownership interests in the Operating Partnership.  Net  operating  results  of  the  Operating  Partnership  attributable  to  limited  partners  are  reflected  in  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG applied ASU 2020-04, which provided optional expedients for transitioning certain debt instruments away from LIBOR to alternative benchmark indexes, with no impact reported on their consolidated financial statements. In 2023, SPG continued to comply with ASU 2021-01, an expansion of the scope of ASU 2020-04 to include derivatives, allowing continued application of the guidance through December 31, 2024. The transition was part of a broader market shift away from LIBOR, and SPG\u2019s use of these accounting updates facilitated smoother contract modifications and hedge accounting treatments without material financial impact. The continuation of compliance through 2023 ensured consistent financial reporting during the reference rate reform period.",

General and administrative expense primarily includes executive compensation, benefits and travel expenses as well as costs of being a public company, including certain legal costs, audit fees, regulatory fees, and certain other professional fees.\n\n## Simon Property Group Acquisition Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe Company sponsored, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, a special purpose acquisition corporation, or SPAC, named Simon Property Group Acquisition Holdings, Inc.  On February 18, 2021, the SPAC announced the pricing  of  its  initial  public  offering,  which  was  consummated  on  February  23,  2021,  generating  gross  proceeds  of $345.0 million, which have been placed in a trust account and is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in Investments held in trust - special purpose acquisition company.  The SPAC is a consolidated VIE which was formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination.  The Company accounts for the noncontrolling interest in the SPAC as noncontrolling redeemable interests as these instruments are redeemable at the option of the holder and  are  classified  as  temporary  equity  at  their  redemption  value  in  Simon's  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet in Limited partners preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests and in  the  Operating  Partnership's  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet  in  Preferred  units,  various  series,  at liquidation value, and noncontrolling redeemable interests.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform,' which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the US GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market  transition  from  LIBOR  and  other  interbank  offered  rates  to  alternative  reference  rates.  Additional  optional expedients, exceptions, and clarifications were created in ASU 2021-01. The guidance is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to any contract modifications or existing and new hedging relationships through December 31, 2022. We elected the expedients in conjunction with transitioning certain debt instruments, as discussed in note 7, to alternative benchmark indexes.  There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements at adoption.\n\n## 4. Real Estate Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\nWe acquire interests in properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We acquire interests in individual properties or portfolios of real estate companies that meet our investment criteria and sell properties which no longer meet our strategic criteria. Unless otherwise noted below, gains and losses on these transactions are included in gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and  impairment,  net  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive  income.  We capitalize asset acquisition costs and expense costs related to business combinations, as well as disposition related costs as they are incurred. We",

      "question": "How did the resolution of VIL's payment shortfall in 2023 influence AMT's strategic decisions regarding the VIL OCDs in 2024, and what was the financial outcome of those decisions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, VIL resumed full payments on its contractual obligations to AMT, which had previously been impacted by the VIL Shortfall. This resolution allowed AMT to reassess its strategic exposure to the Indian market, ultimately leading to the decision to convert and sell the VIL OCDs in 2024. AMT converted 14.4 billion INR (approximately $172.7 million) of VIL OCDs into 1,440 million VIL shares and sold them for net proceeds of 18.0 billion INR (approximately $216.0 million). The remaining 1.6 billion INR (approximately $19.2 million) of VIL OCDs were also sold for net proceeds of 1.8 billion INR (approximately $22.0 million). These transactions resulted in a total gain of $46.4 million recognized in 2024, reflecting the financial benefit of AMT's strategic decisions following the stabilization of VIL's payments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMT(2023) \u2192 VIL: VIL resumed full payments after the 2022 shortfall, prompting AMT to reassess its India exposure.",
        "Hop 2: VIL \u2192 VIL OCDs: VIL issued OCDs in 2023, which were held by AMT's Indian subsidiary ATC TIPL and carried interest at 11.2% annually.",
        "Hop 3: VIL OCDs \u2190 AMT(2024): In 2024, AMT converted and sold all VIL OCDs and equity, realizing a $46.4 million gain from the transactions."

The VIL OCDs were (a) to be repaid by VIL with interest or (b) convertible into equity of VIL. The VIL OCDs were issued for an aggregate face value of 16.0 billion INR (approximately $193.2 million on the date of issuance). The VIL OCDs were to mature in tranches with 8.0 billion INR (approximately $96.6 million on the date of issuance) maturing on August 27, 2023 and 8.0 billion INR (approximately $96.6 million on the date of issuance) maturing on August 27, 2024. In August 2023, the Company amended the agreements governing the VIL OCDs to, among other items, extend the maturity of the first tranche of the VIL OCDs to August 27, 2024. The fair value of the VIL OCDs at issuance was approximately $116.5 million. The VIL OCDs accrued interest at a rate of 11.2% annually.

      "question": "How did the redemption activity of SPG's 7.50% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units in 2023 and 2024 impact Simon's preferred stock premium amortization, and what does this indicate about SPG's capital structure strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SPG redeemed 25,000 preferred units for $2.5 million, and in 2024, it redeemed 75,000 units for $7.5 million, reducing the carrying value of these units from $23.0 million in 2023 to $15.5 million in 2024. These redemptions directly affected Simon, as the preferred distributions paid by the Operating Partnership to Simon are equal to the dividends Simon pays on its preferred stock. Correspondingly, Simon's unamortized premium on the Series J 8 3/8% Preferred Stock decreased from $1.3 million in 2023 to $0.9 million in 2024, reflecting accelerated amortization due to the increased redemption activity. This indicates that SPG is strategically reducing its preferred equity obligations, likely to optimize its capital structure by lowering preferred dividend costs over time.",

      "question": "How did the changes in AMT's debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) thresholds in 2023 and the resulting impact on GTP Acquisition Partners' excess cash flow restrictions evolve into the 2024 securitization loan agreement terms, particularly in relation to restricted cash balances?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's relationship with GTP Acquisition Partners was governed by securitization loan agreements that imposed two DSCR thresholds: a Cash Trap DSCR at 1.30x and a Minimum DSCR at 1.15x. If either threshold was breached, excess cash flow was restricted and either deposited into a Cash Trap Reserve Account or used to amortize debt, limiting AMT\u2019s access to those funds. This had the potential to affect AMT\u2019s ability to fund capital expenditures and meet REIT distribution requirements. By 2024, the structure remained largely intact, but the restricted cash balance held in these reserve accounts decreased from $76.3 million in 2023 to $60.8 million in 2024, suggesting either improved compliance with DSCR thresholds or a reduction in excess cash flow generation. The continued reliance on these DSCR-based restrictions shows that AMT\u2019s financial performance remained closely tied to the performance of GTP Acquisition Partners under the securitization loan agreements, with the same mechanisms in place to control cash flow distribution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMT(2023) \u2192 GTP Acquisition Partners: AMT depended on GTP Acquisition Partners' cash flow, which was restricted if DSCR thresholds (1.30x and 1.15x) were breached, impacting AMT\u2019s liquidity.",
        "Hop 2: GTP Acquisition Partners \u2192 Securitization Loan Agreements: GTP Acquisition Partners was subject to the Securitization Loan Agreements, which governed cash flow distribution based on DSCR compliance and reserve account usage.",
        "Hop 3: Securitization Loan Agreements \u2190 AMT(2024): In 2024, AMT remained dependent on the same securitization structure, with restricted cash balances decreasing to $60.8 million, indicating a potential improvement or shift in cash flow dynamics."

If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the Bank Loan Agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.\n\nRestrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust SecuritizationsThe indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the 'Series 2015-2 Notes') issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC ('GTP Acquisition Partners') in a private securitization transaction in May 2015 (the '2015 Securitization') and the loan agreement related to the securitization transactions completed in March 2018 (the '2018 Securitization') and March 2023 (the '2023 Securitization' and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the 'Trust Securitizations') (collectively, the 'Securitization Loan Agreements') include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the 'AMT Asset Subs') are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements).\n\nUnder the Securitization Loan Agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the 'Series 2018-1A Securities'), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the 'Series 2018-1R Securities' and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the '2018 Securities'), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities 2023-1, Subclass A (the 'Series 2023-1A Securities'), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass R (the 'Series 20231R Securities' and, together with the Series 2023-1A Securities, the '2023 Securities') issued in the Trust Securitizations (the 'Loan'), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after paying all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of these assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to us for use. As of December 31, 2024, $60.8 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash.\n\nCertain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio ('DSCR') is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.",

      "question": "How did the change in the number of communications sites securing the Series 2015-2 Notes between 2023 and 2024 affect AMT's equity interests structure and its overall securitized debt strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Series 2015-2 Notes were secured by 3,343 communications sites, while in 2024, the number of secured sites decreased slightly to 3,338. This reduction in the number of sites likely prompted a reassessment of the collateral base supporting the notes, which are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust, and a security interest in GTP Acquisition Partners' equity interests in its subsidiaries. In response, AMT adjusted its securitized debt strategy by completing the $1.3 billion 2023 Securitization, which expanded the Trust\u2019s secured assets to include 5,029 broadcast and wireless communications towers. This broader collateral pool under the Trust Loan Agreement indicates a shift toward a more diversified and larger asset-backed financing structure, reducing reliance on the older Series 2015-2 Notes\u2019 collateral base and leveraging newer securitization vehicles.",

      "question": "How did SPG's strategic investment in J.C. Penney in 2023 influence its ownership changes in SPARC Group in 2024, particularly in light of J.C. Penney's acquisition of SPARC Group's retail operations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SPG had a strategic investment in J.C. Penney and also held a noncontrolling interest in SPARC Group, which was diluted to 33.3% in Q3 2023, resulting in a $145.8 million pre-tax gain. In 2024, J.C. Penney completed an all-equity acquisition of SPARC Group's retail operations, forming Catalyst, in which SPG now holds a 31.3% noncontrolling interest. This transaction led to a $100.5 million non-cash pre-tax gain for SPG. The 2023 investment in J.C. Penney appears to have been a precursor to the 2024 consolidation of SPARC Group's retail assets under J.C. Penney, which SPG followed through reduced direct ownership in SPARC and a new structure under Catalyst. This reflects a strategic evolution in SPG's retail portfolio positioning through the entity chain.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SPG(2023) \u2192 J.C. Penney: SPG had a strategic investment in J.C. Penney and also held a stake in SPARC Group, which was diluted in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: J.C. Penney \u2192 SPARC Group: In 2024, J.C. Penney acquired SPARC Group\u2019s retail operations in an all-equity transaction, forming Catalyst.",
        "Hop 3: SPARC Group \u2190 SPG(2024): SPG\u2019s ownership in SPARC Group was further reduced in 2024, and it now holds a 31.3% interest in the newly formed Catalyst entity."

      "question": "How did SPG's strategic investment in SPARC Group in 2023 influence its subsequent divestiture decisions with ABG in 2024, particularly in light of SPARC Group's earlier partnership with ABG?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SPG held a 33.3% noncontrolling interest in SPARC Group, which had formed a strategic partnership with ABG to operate Reebok in the U.S. During the third quarter of 2023, SPARC Group issued equity to a third party, diluting SPG\u2019s ownership and triggering a non-cash pre-tax gain of $145.8 million. This dilution may have signaled a strategic shift in SPG\u2019s involvement with SPARC Group and its downstream relationships, including with ABG. In late 2023, SPG sold a portion of its ABG stake for $300.2 million, recognizing a $157.1 million gain. By Q1 2024, SPG completed the full divestiture of its remaining ABG interest for $1.2 billion, realizing a pretax gain of $414.8 million. The earlier dilution in SPARC Group appears to have initiated a broader strategic retreat from its retail platform investments, culminating in the full exit from ABG in 2024.",

        "Hop 1: SPG(2023) \u2192 SPARC Group: SPG held a 33.3% noncontrolling interest in SPARC Group in 2023 and recognized a $145.8 million non-cash gain after SPARC Group issued equity to a third party.",
        "Hop 2: SPARC Group \u2192 ABG: SPARC Group had a strategic partnership with ABG to operate Reebok in the U.S., indicating a core business relationship influencing SPG\u2019s broader retail platform investment strategy.",
        "Hop 3: ABG \u2190 SPG(2024): In 2024, SPG fully exited its ABG position for $1.2 billion, realizing a $414.8 million pretax gain, following a partial sale in late 2023 for $300.2 million with a $157.1 million gain."

      "question": "How did the changes in SPG's Series J 8 3/8% Preferred Stock carrying value and redemption terms between 2022 and 2024 reflect Simon's evolving role as issuer and partner in SPG's capital structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that the Series J 8 3/8% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock was issued at a premium of $7.5 million, with an unamortized premium of $1.9 million at year-end. By 2024, the unamortized premium had decreased to $0.9 million, indicating ongoing amortization of the original premium. The redemption terms remained consistent, with Simon retaining the right to redeem shares on or after October 15, 2027, at $50.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. Meanwhile, Simon, as both issuer of the preferred stock and partner in SPG, saw the carrying value of preferred units held by it drop from $25.5 million in 2022 to $15.5 million in 2024, reflecting redemptions of 75,000 units in 2024 and 25,000 units in 2023, totaling $10 million in redemptions over two years. This reduction indicates a strategic shift in SPG\u2019s capital structure, with Simon actively managing its preferred equity exposure through redemptions, while maintaining its role as issuer of the preferred stock.",

      "answer": "In 2023, VIL resumed full payments after a period of partial payments (the 'VIL Shortfall'), which had led AMT to record reserves and impairments totaling $508.6 million in 2022 and an additional $322.0 million goodwill impairment in 2023. This resolution likely contributed to AMT\u2019s decision to convert and sell the VIL OCDs in 2024. Specifically, in March 2024, AMT converted 14.4 billion INR ($172.7 million) of VIL OCDs into equity, and subsequently sold those shares in April 2024 for $216.0 million. It also sold the remaining 1.6 billion INR ($19.2 million) of OCDs in June 2024, realizing a total gain of $46.4 million. These actions suggest that AMT used the improved financial stability of VIL to monetize its position in the OCDs, turning a previously risky receivable into a realized gain, while also reducing exposure to a volatile Indian market that had previously required significant impairment charges.",

The VIL OCDs were (a) to be repaid by VIL with interest or (b) convertible into equity of VIL. The VIL OCDs were issued for an aggregate face value of 16.0 billion INR (approximately $193.2 million on the date of issuance). The VIL OCDs were to mature in tranches with 8.0 billion INR (approximately $96.6 million on the date of issuance) maturing on August 27, 2023 and 8.0 billion INR (approximately $96.6 million on the date of issuance) maturing on August 27, 2024. In August 2023, the Company amended the agreements governing the VIL OCDs to, among other items, extend the maturity of the first tranche of the VIL OCDs to August 27, 2024. The fair value of the VIL OCDs at issuance was approximately $116.5 million. The VIL OCDs accrued interest at a rate of 11.2% annually. Interest was payable to ATC TIPL semi-annually, with the first payment received in September 2023.\n\nOn March 23, 2024, the Company converted an aggregate face value of 14.4 billion INR (approximately $172.7 million) of VIL OCDs into 1,440 million shares of equity of VIL (the 'VIL Shares').\n\nOn April 29, 2024, the Company completed the sale of 1,440 million VIL Shares at a price of 12.78 INR per share. The net proceeds for this transaction were approximately 18.0 billion INR (approximately $216.0 million at the date of settlement) after deducting commissions and fees.\n\nOn June 5, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the remaining aggregate face value of 1.6 billion INR (approximately $19.2 million) of the VIL OCDs. The net proceeds for this transaction, ex cluding accrued interest, were approx imately 1.8 billion INR (approx imately $22.0 million at the date of settlement) after deducting fees.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a gain of $46.4 million on the sales of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs.

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT disclosed the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction with DIT, which included the value of the VIL OCDs (~$116.5 million at issuance) as part of the total aggregate consideration of up to 210 billion INR (~$2.5 billion). By 2024, the transaction was finalized with total consideration of 182 billion INR (~$2.2 billion), reflecting a reduction of ~$300 million from the upper bound of the initial estimate. During the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed ~$354.1 million to AMT, which included the value of the VIL OCDs and VIL Shares, satisfying the economic benefit retained by AMT. However, AMT recorded a $1.2 billion loss on the sale, primarily due to the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments. This indicates that while the VIL OCDs contributed to the final proceeds, the overall financial outcome was significantly impacted by the translation losses upon exiting the Indian market.",

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2023, the Company undertook a strategic review of its India operations, where the Company evaluated the appropriate level of exposure to the India market within its global portfolio of communications assets, and assessed opportunities to repurpose capital to drive long-term shareholder value and sustained growth. The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below).\n\nOn January 4, 2024, the Company, through ATC TIPL, entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust ('DIT'), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the 'ATC TIPL Transaction'). Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration represented up to approximately 210 billion Indian Rupees ('INR') (approximately $2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed in note 11), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of the Company's existing term loan in India, by DIT.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately 29.6 billion INR (approximately $354.1 million) to the Company, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction of the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by the Company at closing.\n\nThe ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). The Company used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of $1.2 billion, which primarily included the reclassification of the Company's cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $1.1 billion. The loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the changes in SPG's mortgage debt structure between 2023 and 2024 affect the company's exposure to cross-default provisions and its ability to meet financial covenants?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SPG had $5.2 billion in mortgage indebtedness with cross-default provisions affecting five properties across two pools, increasing exposure to potential acceleration if any single mortgage defaulted. By 2024, SPG's financing strategy included greater reliance on unsecured debt through the $2.0 billion Commercial Paper program and Supplemental Facility, which introduced financial covenants tied to corporate credit ratings. This shift likely reduced SPG's exposure to property-level cross-default risks but increased sensitivity to credit rating changes, as seen in the Supplemental Facility's SOFR plus 72.5 basis point rate based on current ratings. The transition from secured to unsecured financing reflects a strategic move to manage covenant compliance more flexibly while reducing asset-specific risk.",

Penney's acquisition of SPARC Group's retail operations and the formation of Catalyst, SPG's lease income from the combined entity (Catalyst) increased slightly to $105.9 million.

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT entered into a $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement that included cross-default provisions, which meant that a payment default or acceleration under certain other material debt agreements could trigger defaults under this facility. By 2024, these provisions constrained AMT's financial flexibility, particularly as inflationary pressures and higher interest rates increased borrowing costs and limited its ability to incur additional debt or distribute capital to shareholders. The 2024 filing specifically notes that cross-default provisions in credit agreements could lead to accelerated repayment demands, which, given the already elevated interest rate environment, made it more challenging for AMT to manage liquidity and meet REIT distribution requirements without jeopardizing its financial position.",

In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation or our customers may be unwilling to pay contractual increases or demand discounts upon renewal, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Inflation has also contributed to foreign currency exchange rate volatility, including in several of the markets where we operate. The ongoing impact of inflation may continue to create foreign exchange rate instability in our international markets, including in markets such as Africa and Latin America, that could, in turn, depress the value of that market's currency, thereby adversely impacting our business, results of operations, financial condition or the underlying value of foreign subsidiaries.\n\nIn addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. Although the Federal Reserve Board and other central banks began cutting interest rates in the latter part of 2024, interest rates remain above recent norms. The combination of higher interest rates and high inflation could lead to an ex tended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve. Additionally, higher inflation or higher costs of capital could also impact the risk premiums or market returns on our assets. Changes in costs of capital could adversely impact the underlying value of our assets, which could in turn result in impairment charges.\n\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\n\nThe agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets.\n\nThe agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower or other communications infrastructure development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Our credit agreements also contain crossdefault and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds. In the event of such a default, the resulting cross-defaults or cross-accelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources-Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity' and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\n\nWe also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments, which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws and Regulations\n\nOur foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nOur international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 1.    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBusiness -American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, 'ATC' or the 'Company') is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company's primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting ('AZP') and structural analysis, which primarily support the Company's site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company's customers include its tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nThe Company's portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators and holds a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that the Company leases primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC's principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\nThe Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers and in its data centers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, the Company's international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of its U.S. indoor DAS networks business, its Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of its operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Mexico and Nigeria. In January 2022, a majority of the Company's operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation -The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company's ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of December 31, 2021, the Company holds (i) a 52% controlling interest in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of the Company's operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe') (Allianz and CDPQ (each as defined in note 16) hold the noncontrolling interests) and (ii) a 51% controlling interest in a joint venture whose holdings consist of the Company's operations in Bangladesh (Confidence Tower Holdings Ltd. ('Confidence Group') holds the noncontrolling interest). As of December 31, 2021, ATC Europe holds an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively (PGGM holds the noncontrolling interests). See note 16 for a discussion of changes to the Company's noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nChange in Reportable Segments -During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the Company's acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite,' and the acquisition, the 'CoreSite Acquisition'), the Company updated its reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is within the Company's property operations. The Company will now report its results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada,",

      "question": "How did JPMorgan Chase Bank's role in AMT's financing structure evolve from its initial $10.5 billion bridge loan commitment in 2022 to its position in the multicurrency revolving credit agreement in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JPMorgan Chase Bank provided a $10.5 billion bridge loan commitment to finance AMT's CoreSite Acquisition, but this commitment was terminated by December 8, 2021, as AMT secured alternative financing. By 2024, JPMorgan Chase Bank had transitioned from a bridge loan provider to a co-documentation agent and joint lead arranger in AMT's multicurrency revolving credit agreement, as evidenced by the amendments to the agreement dated through mid-2024. This reflects a shift from a short-term financing role to a more enduring strategic partnership in AMT's capital structure.",

      "question": "How did AMT's reliance on GTP Acquisition Partners in 2022 constrain its ability to incur new indebtedness in 2023, particularly given the 1.30x debt service coverage ratio threshold and rising inflationary pressures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMT relied on GTP Acquisition Partners, which was subject to restrictive covenants that prohibited it from incurring additional indebtedness unless it maintained a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) above 1.30x. This DSCR threshold determined whether excess cash flow could be released to GTP Acquisition Partners and ultimately to AMT. By 2023, rising inflation and higher interest rates increased AMT\u2019s cost of capital and reduced its financial flexibility, making it more challenging to maintain the required DSCR. As a result, AMT\u2019s ability to incur new indebtedness was constrained because any breach of the 1.30x DSCR could trigger cash flow restrictions and prevent the release of excess funds from GTP Acquisition Partners, directly impacting AMT\u2019s liquidity and capacity to take on new debt.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMT(2022) \u2192 GTP Acquisition Partners: AMT relied on GTP Acquisition Partners, whose equity was pledged as security, with cash flow release contingent on maintaining a DSCR above 1.30x.",
        "Hop 2: GTP Acquisition Partners \u2192 Incurring Indebtedness: GTP Acquisition Partners was restricted from incurring new indebtedness unless it met the DSCR requirement and other financial covenants.",
        "Hop 3: Incurring Indebtedness \u2190 AMT(2023): In 2023, inflationary pressures and higher interest rates made it harder for AMT to meet the DSCR threshold, limiting its ability to incur new debt."

To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act' and, such requirements, the 'Risk Retention Rules'), the Trust issued, and one of the Company's affiliates purchased, $26.4 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the 'Series 2018-1R Securities' and, together with the Series 20181A Securities, the '2018 Securities') to retain an 'eligible horizontal residual interest' (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities.\n\nThe Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the 'Series 2013-2A Securities' and, together with the 2018 Securities the 'Trust Securities') issued in a securitization transaction in March 2013 (the '2013 Securitization' and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the 'Trust Securitizations') remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 Securitization.\n\nThe assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the 'Loan') made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the 'AMT Asset Subs'). The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs' interests in 5,113 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the 'Trust Sites').\n\nThe component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (the 'Loan Agreement'). The Loan Agreement includes terms and conditions, including with respect to secured assets, substantially consistent with the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 15, 2013. The 2018 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Loan Agreement and were issued in two separate subclasses of the same series. The 2018 Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of 3.652% and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of 4.459%. The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components.\n\nThe Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs' personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs' rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the 'Guarantor'), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations.\n\nUnder the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable, including interest payments, subject to the conditions described below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company.\n\nIn order to distribute any excess cash flow to the Company, the AMT Asset Subs and GTP Acquisition Partners must each maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (the 'DSCR'), which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. If the DSCR were equal to or below 1.30x (the 'Cash Trap DSCR') for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the 'Cash Trap Reserve Account') instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable.

The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.\n\nFailure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.\n\nRestrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust SecuritizationsThe indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the 'Series 2015-2 Notes') issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC ('GTP Acquisition Partners') in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the 'AMT Asset Subs') are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements).\n\nUnder the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the 'Series 2013-2A Securities'), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the 'Series 2018-1A Securities'), and the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the 'Series 2018-1R Securities' and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the '2018 Securities') issued in the Trust Securitizations (the 'Loan'), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement.

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT had completed the full acquisition of ATC TIPL, achieving 100% ownership through a series of redemptions from noncontrolling interest holders, including Tata Sons and Macquarie, for a total of approximately $936.2 million. By 2024, AMT reversed this position by selling ATC TIPL to DIT for approximately $2.2 billion, after receiving $354.1 million in distributions prior to closing. This strategic pivot reflects a shift from direct ownership to a partnership model with DIT, an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by Brookfield Asset Management. The transaction allowed AMT to exit the Indian market and repay $2.2 billion in debt under its 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, despite recording a $1.2 billion loss from the sale, primarily due to the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments.",

        "Hop 2: ATC TIPL \u2192 DIT: In 2024, ATC TIPL became the subject of a strategic divestiture by AMT, culminating in its acquisition by DIT for $2.2 billion after regulatory approvals.",

Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration represented up to approximately 210 billion Indian Rupees ('INR') (approximately $2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed in note 11), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of the Company's existing term loan in India, by DIT.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately 29.6 billion INR (approximately $354.1 million) to the Company, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction of the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by the Company at closing.\n\nThe ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). The Company used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of $1.2 billion, which primarily included the reclassification of the Company's cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $1.1 billion. The loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n",

By 2024, AMT converted $172.7 million of these OCDs into VIL equity and sold both the shares and remaining OCDs, realizing a total gain of $46.4 million.

In the third quarter of 2022, one of our largest customers in India, V odafone Idea Limited ('VIL'), communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us (the 'VIL Shortfall'). We recorded reserves in late 2022 and the first half of 2023 for the V IL Shortfall. In the second half of 2023, V IL began making payments in full of its monthly contractual obligations owed to us.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we deferred recognition of revenue of approximately $27.3 million, net of recoveries, related to VIL in India. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized approximately $95.7 million of this previously deferred revenue. As of December 31, 2024, we have fully recognized this previously deferred revenue.\n\nIn 2023, we initiated a strategic review of our India business. During the process, and based on information gathered therein, we updated our estimate on the fair value of the India reporting unit and determined that the carrying value exceeded fair value. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 for our India reporting unit.\n\nIn February 2023, and as amended in August 2023, VIL issued optionally convertible debentures (the 'VIL OCDs') to ATC TIPL in exchange for VIL's payment of certain amounts towards accounts receivables.

The VIL OCDs were (a) to be repaid by VIL with interest or (b) convertible into equity of VIL. The VIL OCDs were issued for an aggregate face value of 16.0 billion INR (approximately $193.2 million on the date of issuance).

In August 2023, the Company amended the agreements governing the VIL OCDs to, among other items, extend the maturity of the first tranche of the VIL OCDs to August 27, 2024. The fair value of the VIL OCDs at issuance was approximately $116.5 million. The VIL OCDs accrued interest at a rate of 11.2% annually.

This impairment was a key financial outcome of the review and informed the decision to enter into the transaction with DIT. The ATC TIPL transaction, finalized in 2024, represented a strategic exit from a portion of AMT's Indian operations and was expected to potentially yield up to 210 billion INR (approximately $2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and repayment of existing intercompany debt.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG held a significant interest in ABG, which had a strategic partnership with SPARC Group for Reebok's U.S. operations. This positioned SPG to benefit from SPARC Group's expansion, including the acquisition of Reebok. However, in 2023, SPG's ownership in SPARC Group was diluted to 33.3% due to new equity issuance, resulting in a non-cash pre-tax gain of $145.8 million. Additionally, SPG sold part of its ABG stake in Q4 2023 for $300.2 million, recognizing a pre-tax gain of $157.1 million. These actions suggest that SPG leveraged its earlier investment in ABG to realize financial gains in 2023, even as its direct stake in SPARC Group decreased.",

        "Hop 1: SPG(2022) \u2192 ABG: SPG had a significant investment in ABG, which was a strategic partner of SPARC Group, particularly in relation to Reebok.",

The  interests  were  acquired  through  two  separate  joint ventures, a licensing venture and an operating venture. Our aggregate investment in the ventures was $67.6 million. In connection with the acquisition of our interest, the Forever 21 joint venture recorded a non-cash bargain purchase gain  in  the  second  quarter  of  2020,  of  which  our  share  of  $35.0  million  pre-tax  is  included  in  income  from unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. In the first quarter of 2021, we and our partner, ABG, each acquired additional 12.5% interests in the licensing and operations of Forever 21,  our  share  of  which  was  $56.3  million,  bringing  our  respective  interests  to  50%.  Subsequently,  the  Forever  21 operations were merged into SPARC Group.\n\nOn October 16, 2019, we contributed approximately $276.8 million consisting of cash and the Shop Premium Outlets, or SPO, assets for a 45% noncontrolling interest in RGG to create a new multi-platform venture dedicated to digital value shopping.  We attributed substantially all of our investment to goodwill and certain amortizing and nonamortizing intangibles.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, as discussed in note 4, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in a hotel adjacent to one of our properties from our joint venture partner. As a result of this acquisition, we now own 100% of this property.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we disposed of our interests in a multi-family residential investment. Our share of the gross proceeds was $17.9 million. The gain of $16.2 million is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nIn  2016,  we  and  a  group  of  co-investors  acquired  certain  assets  and  liabilities  of A\u00e9ropostale,  a  retailer  of apparel and accessories, out of bankruptcy and subsequently renamed SPARC Group.  The interests were acquired through two separate joint ventures, a licensing venture and an operating venture.  In April 2018, we contributed our entire interest in the licensing venture in exchange for additional interests in ABG, a brand development, marketing, and entertainment company.  In January 2020, we acquired additional interests of 5.05% and 1.37% in SPARC Group and ABG,  respectively,  for  $6.7  million  and  $33.5  million,  respectively.  During  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  SPARC acquired certain assets and operations of Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brands out of bankruptcy. During the second quarter of 2021, SPARC Group acquired certain assets and operations of Eddie Bauer. At December 31, 2021, our noncontrolling equity method interests in the operations venture of SPARC Group was 50.0%.\n\n## International Investments\n\nWe  conduct  our  international  operations  primarily  through  joint  venture  arrangements  and  account  for  the majority of these international joint venture investments using the equity method of accounting.\n\n## European Investments\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  we  owned  63,924,148  shares,  or  approximately  22.4%,  of  Kl\u00e9pierre,  which  had  a quoted market price of $23.65 per share. Our share of net income, net of amortization of our excess investment, was $145.1 million, $26.5 million and $145.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on applicable Euro:USD exchange rates and after our conversion of Kl\u00e9pierre's results to GAAP, Kl\u00e9pierre's total assets, total liabilities, and noncontrolling interests were $18.1 billion, $11.9 billion, and $1.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $20.9 billion, $14.4 billion, and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Kl\u00e9pierre's  total  revenues,  operating  income  before  other  items  and  consolidated  net  income  were  approximately $1.2  billion,  $380.5  million  and  $848.1  million,  respectively,  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  $1.3  billion, $327.3 million and $211.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $1.5 billion, $626.3 million and $655.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, before consolidation of the amortization of our excess investment.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Kl\u00e9pierre elected to step-up the tax basis of certain assets in Italy, which  triggered  a  one-time  payment  at  a  significantly  reduced  tax  rate. As  a  result  of  the  step-up  in  tax  basis,  a previously established deferred tax liability was reversed resulting in a non-cash gain, of which our share was $118.4 million.",

      "question": "How did SPG's 2023 investment in J.C. Penney influence its strategic position in SPARC Group following the 2024 restructuring and ownership reduction?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SPG reported lease income of $101.8 million from J.C. Penney, in which it had an investment, signaling a strategic alignment with the retailer. By December 2024, J.C. Penney had acquired SPARC Group's retail operations and was renamed Catalyst Brands, prompting SPG to recognize a non-cash pre-tax gain of $100.5 million. Following this restructuring, SPG's ownership in SPARC Group decreased to 33.3%, down from a previously higher stake, as SPARC Group issued equity to a third party, further diluting SPG's position. This indicates that SPG's earlier investment in J.C. Penney influenced its strategic realignment and financial outcomes in relation to SPARC Group after the 2024 transaction.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT had $251.8 million in restricted cash reserves tied to advance rents under the Trust Securitizations, which were held in accounts controlled by the applicable trustee and reserved for the succeeding month\u2019s obligations. By 2024, this amount dropped significantly to $53.9 million, indicating a substantial decrease in the cash flow buffer held under the same covenants. This reduction suggests that AMT improved its Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) compliance, allowing for earlier release of cash flows and reducing reliance on reserve accounts. The relationship with GTP Acquisition Partners remained intact as AMT continued to hold equity interests in the entity, and the 2015 Indenture still governed the secured revenue notes, but the lower reserve levels indicate a stronger financial position and reduced risk of triggering an amortization period or cash trap event.",

With respect to the Trust Securities, an 'amortization period' also commences if, on the anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Trust Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. If the Series 2015-2 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Series 2015-2 Notes, and such notes will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, as applicable, on each monthly payment date.\n\nThe Loan and the Series 2015-2 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within 18 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2013-2A Securities or the Series 2015-2 Notes, or 36 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due.\n\nThe Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities, as applicable, are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture, as applicable). The organizational documents of the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture also contain certain covenants that require the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, to provide the respective trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify such trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Trust Sites or the 2015 Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites, as applicable, and allow the applicable trustee reasonable access to the sites, including the right to conduct site investigations.\n\nA failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture could prevent the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. Furthermore, if the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners were to default on the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, in which case the Company could lose the revenue associated with those assets. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare such notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes.\n\nFurther, under the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, respectively, are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and, under the 2015 Indenture and in certain circumstances under the Loan Agreement, to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Trust Sites. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the applicable trustee and then released. The $251.8 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the Trust Securitizations and the $107.0 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the 2015 Securitization as of December 31, 2021 are classified as Restricted cash on the Company's accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nIndia Indebtedness -The India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, and an overdraft facility. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank's Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. The overdraft facility bears interest at the Overnight Mumbai Inter-Bank Offer Rate at the time of borrowing plus a spread. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not borrowed under these facilities.",

As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants.\n\n## American Tower Subsidiary Debt\n\n## Securitizations\n\nThe Company has several securitizations in place. Cash flows generated by the communications sites that secure the securitized debt of the Company are only available for payment of such debt and are not available to pay the Company's other obligations or the claims of its creditors. However, subject to certain restrictions, the Company holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to service the securitized debt and other obligations arising out of the securitizations. The securitized debt is the obligation of the issuers thereof or borrowers thereunder, as applicable, and their subsidiaries, and not of the Company or its other subsidiaries.\n\nAmerican Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A and Series 2015-2, Class A -In May 2015, GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC ('GTP Acquisition Partners'), one of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, refinanced existing debt with cash on hand and proceeds from a private issuance (the '2015 Securitization') of $350.0 million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A, which were subsequently repaid on the June 2020 payment date, and $525.0 million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the 'Series 2015-2 Notes').\n\nThe Series 2015-2 Notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Indenture and related series supplements, each dated as of May 29, 2015 (collectively, the '2015 Indenture'), between GTP Acquisition Partners and its subsidiaries (the 'GTP Entities') and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the 2015 Notes was 8.1 years and 3.029%, respectively, as of the date of issuance.\n\nThe outstanding Series 2015-2 Notes are secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,338 communications sites (the '2015 Secured Sites') owned by the GTP Entities and their operating cash flows, (ii) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and fix tures of the GTP Entities, including GTP Acquisition Partners' equity interests in its subsidiaries and (iii) the rights of the G TP Entities under a management agreement.

To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act' and, such requirements, the 'Risk Retention Rules'), the Trust issued, and one of the Company's affiliates purchased, $68.5 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 20231, Subclass R (the 'Series 2023-1R Securities' and, together with the Series 2023-1A Securities, the '2023 Securities') to retain an 'eligible horizontal residual interest' (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2023 Securities.\n\nOn March 29, 2018, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the '2018 Securitization,' and, together with the 2023 Securitization, the 'Trust Securitizations'), in which the Trust issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the 'Series 2018-1A Securities'). To satisfy the Risk Retention Rules, the Trust issued, and one of the Company's affiliates purchased, $26.4 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the 'Series 2018-1R Securities' and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the '2018 Securities') to retain an 'eligible horizontal residual interest' (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities.\n\nThe assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan broken into components or 'componentized' (the 'Loan'), which secures each of the 2018 Securities and the 2023 Securities.

By the second half of 2023, VIL resumed full payments, and AMT recognized $95.7 million of the previously deferred revenue in 2024. Additionally, in February and August 2023, VIL issued $193.2 million in VIL OCDs to AMT's subsidiary, ATC TIPL, as part of a payment arrangement. In 2024, AMT converted and sold the VIL OCDs and equity shares, generating $216.0 million and $22.0 million in net proceeds, respectively, and recognizing a total gain of $46.4 million. The resolution of the VIL Shortfall thus directly enabled the financial restructuring through the VIL OCDs, which culminated in significant realized gains for AMT in 2024.",

SPG's legal ownership in these properties ranged from 23% to 94%, with eight consolidated as of 2024.

To the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved, we could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Relating to Real Estate Investments and Operations\n\n## Our  international  activities  may  subject  us  to  risks  that  are  different  from  or  greater  than  those associated with our domestic operations.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  we  held  interests  in  consolidated  and  joint  venture  properties  that  operate  in Austria, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. We also have an equity stake in Kl\u00e9pierre, a publicly traded European real estate company, which  operates  in  14  countries  in  Europe.  Accordingly,  our  operating  results  and  the  value  of  our  international operations  may  be  impacted  by  any  unhedged  movements  in  the  foreign  currencies  in  which  those  operations transact and in which our net investment in those international operations is held. While we occasionally enter into hedging  agreements  to  manage  our  exposure  to  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  these  agreements  may  not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely.\n\nWe may pursue additional investment, ownership, development and redevelopment/expansion opportunities outside  the  United  States.  Such  international  activities  carry  risks  that  are  different  from  those  we  face  with  our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n- adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;\n- changes in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;\n- impact  from  international  trade  disputes  and  the  associated  impact  on  our  tenants'  supply  chain  and consumer spending levels;\n- challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corporate governance, operations, taxes and litigation;\n- the risk  that  we,  our  employees  and/or  agents  could  violate  anti-bribery,  anti-corruption  and  international trade laws in the U.S., such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, which could result in criminal or civil sanctions and/or fines, negatively impact our reputation, or require us to incur significant expenses to investigate;\n- differing lending practices;\n- differences in cultures and consumer retail behavior;\n- changes in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect international operations;\n- changes in applicable laws and regulations in these foreign jurisdictions;\n- difficulties in managing international operations;\n- obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; and\n- labor discord, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, epidemics and pandemics, including COVID-19, the fear of spread of contagious diseases, or the threat of international boycotts.\n\nOur international activities represented approximately 7.1% of consolidated net income and 8.5% of our net operating income, or NOI, for the year ended December 31, 2021. To the extent that we expand our international activities, the above risks could increase in significance, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## We  face  risks  associated  with  the  acquisition,  development,  redevelopment  and  expansion  of properties.\n\nWe regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties, and these activities  are  subject  to  various  risks.  We  may  not  be  successful  in  pursuing  acquisition,  development  or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. In addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not perform as well as expected, impacting our anticipated return on investment.

      "answer": "The increase in restricted cash in reserve accounts from 2022 to $60.8 million in 2024 reflects the cumulative impact of AMT's expanded securitization structure with the 2023 securitization joining the 2015 and 2018 securitizations. In 2022, AMT was already subject to reserve account requirements under the 2015 and 2018 securitizations, which mandated that cash flows from secured assets be deposited into reserve accounts before distribution. By 2024, the addition of the 2023 securitization introduced new reserve requirements under the broader Securitization Loan Agreements, tightening liquidity controls and increasing the amount of restricted cash held. This suggests that AMT's compliance strategy has evolved to accommodate more stringent reserve and distribution protocols across a more complex set of securitization agreements, with implications for available cash flow to the parent company.",

If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the Bank Loan Agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.\n\nRestrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust SecuritizationsThe indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the 'Series 2015-2 Notes') issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC ('GTP Acquisition Partners') in a private securitization transaction in May 2015 (the '2015 Securitization') and the loan agreement related to the securitization transactions completed in March 2018 (the '2018 Securitization') and March 2023 (the '2023 Securitization' and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the 'Trust Securitizations') (collectively, the 'Securitization Loan Agreements') include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the 'AMT Asset Subs') are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements).\n\nUnder the Securitization Loan Agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the 'Series 2018-1A Securities'), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the 'Series 2018-1R Securities' and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the '2018 Securities'), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities 2023-1, Subclass A (the 'Series 2023-1A Securities'), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass R (the 'Series 20231R Securities' and, together with the Series 2023-1A Securities, the '2023 Securities') issued in the Trust Securitizations (the 'Loan'), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after paying all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of these assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to us for use. As of December 31, 2024, $60.8 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash.\n\nCertain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio ('DSCR') is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Series 2015-2 Notes were secured by mortgages on 3,531 communications sites, a security interest in personal property of the GTP Entities, and GTP Acquisition Partners' equity interests in its subsidiaries.

American Tower Holding Sub II, LLC reaffirmed its guarantee of the Series 2015-2 Notes and pledged its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners as security for the repayment obligations.

      "question": "How did SPG's adoption of ASU 2021-01 in 2023 influence its management of debt instrument transitions away from LIBOR through December 2024, particularly in terms of financial statement impacts and compliance flexibility?",
      "answer": "SPG adopted ASU 2021-01 in 2023, which expanded the scope of ASU 2020-04 by introducing optional expedients for derivative instruments affected by changes in interest rates used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment. This allowed SPG greater flexibility in managing contract modifications related to the transition away from LIBOR. Since ASU 2020-04 was still in effect through December 31, 2024, SPG continued to apply these expedients in 2024 when transitioning certain debt instruments to alternative benchmark indexes. The company reported no material impact on its consolidated financial statements at adoption in 2023, and this trend continued through 2024, indicating that the combined application of ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2020-04 provided operational relief without significant financial statement consequences during the LIBOR transition period.",

        "Hop 3: ASU 2020-04 \u2190 SPG(2024): SPG continued applying ASU 2020-04 through 2024, using its provisions to transition debt instruments to alternative benchmark indexes, with no material impact reported on financial statements."

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT's Senior Unsecured Debt included various notes with differing interest rates and redemption features, such as a make-whole premium for early redemption and a par call date after which no premium was required. By 2024, AMT introduced the 3.900% and 4.100% Notes under the Senior Unsecured Debt category, which maintained similar redemption mechanics, including the 100% principal redemption price plus a make-whole premium before the par call date. However, the 2024 Notes were issued under updated credit facilities that extended maturity dates for AMT's broader debt structure, including the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility being extended to January 28, 2028. This indicates a strategic shift toward longer-term financing and refinancing of older obligations like the 0.600% Notes, which were repaid using proceeds from the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility in 2024.",

      "question": "How did AMT's strategic decision to convert its VIL OCDs to equity and subsequently sell the investment affect its 2024 financial performance?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's Indian subsidiary, ATC TIPL, held VIL OCDs issued by Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) with a face value of 16.0 billion INR (approximately $193.2 million). These OCDs were convertible into equity or repayable with interest. By August 2023, the maturity of the first tranche was extended to August 2024. In March 2024, AMT converted 14.4 billion INR (approximately $172.7 million) of the VIL OCDs into 1,440 million shares of VIL equity. These shares were sold in April 2024 for net proceeds of approximately 18.0 billion INR (approximately $216.0 million). The remaining 1.6 billion INR (approximately $19.2 million) of OCDs were sold in June 2024 for net proceeds of approximately 1.8 billion INR (approximately $22.0 million). As a result of these transactions, AMT recognized a total gain of $46.4 million in 2024, which was recorded in 'Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes' in the consolidated statements of operations. This strategic move allowed AMT to realize value from its exposure to VIL, contributing positively to its 2024 financial results.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT had a JPM Bridge Loan Commitment of $10.5 billion intended to finance the CoreSite Acquisition, but this commitment was fully terminated by December 8, 2021, as AMT secured alternative financing through other credit facilities. By 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. had transitioned from a potential bridge loan provider to an active participant in AMT's credit agreements, serving as a Co-Documentation Agent and Joint Lead Arranger under the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement dated December 8, 2021, and remained involved in June 2023 through Amendment No. 1 to that agreement. This evolution reflects a strategic shift from a contingent financing relationship to an ongoing partnership in AMT\u2019s capital structure.",

      "question": "How did Simon Property Group's equity-based compensation strategy evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly regarding the structure and capacity of long-term incentives under the 2019 Plan?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that the 2019 Plan included Stock Appreciation Rights as part of its equity-based compensation offerings and highlighted the role of restricted stock awards and LTIP units in long-term incentives for employees and directors. The plan was described as a key mechanism for aligning executive and director interests with long-term shareholder value. By 2023, the company provided more detailed disclosures showing that 8,000,000 shares of common stock had been reserved under the 2019 Plan, indicating a significant capacity for future equity grants. Additionally, SPG emphasized that the substantial majority of these awards were market or performance-based, with LTIP units continuing to play a central role in long-term incentive compensation. The evolution from 2022 to 2023 reflects a more structured and capacity-defined approach to equity compensation, with increased emphasis on performance alignment and long-term value creation.",

Simon Property Group, L.P.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)\n\nDirectors who are not also our employees or employees of our affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the  2019 plan. Each independent director receives an annual cash retainer of $110,000, and an annual restricted stock award with a grant date value of $175,000. Committee chairs receive annual retainers for the Company's Audit, Compensation,  and  Governance  and  Nominating  Committees  of  $35,000,  $35,000  and  $25,000,  respectively. Directors  receive  fixed  annual  retainers  for  service  on  the Audit,  Compensation  and  Governance  and  Nominating Committees,  of  $15,000,  $15,000,  and  $10,000,  respectively.  The  Lead  Director  receives  an  annual  retainer  of $50,000.  These retainers are paid 50% in cash and 50% in restricted stock.\n\nRestricted stock awards vest in full after one year.  Once vested, the delivery of the shares of restricted stock (including reinvested dividends) is deferred under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the director retires, dies or becomes disabled or otherwise no longer serves as a director. The directors may vote and are entitled to receive  dividends  on  the  underlying  shares;  however,  any  dividends  on  the  shares  of  restricted  stock  must  be reinvested  in  shares  of  common  stock  and  held  in  the  Director  Deferred  Compensation  Plan  until  the  shares  of restricted stock are delivered to the former director.\n\n## Stock Based Compensation\n\nOur long-term incentive compensation awards under our stock based compensation plans primarily take the form of LTIP units, restricted stock grants and restricted stock units.  These awards are either market or performancebased and are based on various individual, corporate and business unit performance measures as further described below. The expense related to these programs, net of amounts capitalized, is included within home and regional office costs  and  general  and  administrative  costs  in  the  accompanying  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive income.    In  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  the  Compensation  and  Human  Capital  Committees  established  and  made awards under a 2021 Long-Term Incentive Program, or 2021 LTI Program.  Awards under the 2021 LTI Program took the form of LTIP units and restricted stock units, or RSUs, as further discussed below.\n\nLTIP Programs. The Compensation and Human Capital Committees has approved long-term, performance based incentive compensation programs, or the LTIP programs, for certain senior employees. Awards under the LTIP programs take the form of LTIP units, a form of limited partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership, which are subject to the participant maintaining employment with us through certain dates and other conditions as described in the applicable award agreements. Awarded LTIP units not earned in accordance with the conditions set forth in the applicable award agreements are forfeited. Earned and fully vested LTIP units are equivalent to units of the Operating Partnership.  During  the  performance  period,  participants  are  entitled  to  receive  distributions  on  the  LTIP  units awarded to them equal to 10% of the regular quarterly distributions paid on a unit of the Operating Partnership. As a result, we account for these LTIP units as participating securities under the two-class method of computing earnings per share.\n\nIn  2018,  the  Compensation  and  Human  Capital  Committees  established  and  granted  awards  under  a redesigned LTIP program, or the 2018 LTIP program.  Awards under the 2018 LTIP program were granted in two tranches, Tranche A LTIP units and Tranche B LTIP units. Each of the Tranche A LTIP units and the Tranche B LTIP units  will  be  considered  earned  if,  and  only  to  the  extent  to  which,  the  respective  goals  based  on  Funds  From Operations,  or  FFO,  per  share  or  Relative  TSR  Goal  performance  criteria,  as  defined  in  the  applicable  award agreements, are achieved during the applicable two-year and three-year performance periods of the Tranche A LTIP units and Tranche B LTIP units, respectively.  One half of the earned Tranche A LTIP units will vest on January 1, 2021 with the other one-half vesting on January 1, 2022.\n\nThe grant  date  fair  value  of  the  portion  of  the  LTIP  units  based  on  achieving  the  target  FFO  performance criteria is $6.1 million for the Tranche A LTIP units and the Tranche B LTIP units, for a total of $12.1 million.  The 2018 LTIP program provides that the value of the FFO-based award may be adjusted up or down based on the Company's performance  compared  to  the  target  FFO  performance  criteria  and  has  a  maximum  potential  fair  value  of  $18.2 million.\n\nIn 2021 and 2019, the Compensation and Human Capital Committees established and granted awards under a redesigned LTIP program, or the 2021 LTIP program and the 2019 LTIP program, respectively.  Awards under these programs will be considered earned if, and only to the extent to which, the respective performance conditions (based on  Funds  From  Operations,  or  FFO,  per  share,  and  Objective  Criteria  Goals)  and  market  conditions  (based  on Relative or",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's subsidiary had 3,343 communications sites securing the Series 2015-2 Notes, while in 2024, this number decreased to 3,338 sites. According to the 'Securitizations' section in both the 2023 and 2024 filings, AMT holds the right to receive excess cash flows not needed to service the securitized debt. The reduction in the number of secured sites by 5 directly affects the total asset base generating cash flows, which in turn reduces the potential pool of excess cash available for AMT to receive. This change implies a slight constriction in AMT's cash flow rights tied to the collateral base of the Series 2015-2 Notes.",

      "answer": "Simon Property Group maintained a controlling interest in its European investee across both years, with ownership percentages ranging from 23% to 94% as of December 31, 2023, and remaining consistent as of December 31, 2024. This investee held interests in 12 Designer Outlet properties, including one in Austria. By 2024, SPG disclosed that their international operations, which included properties in Austria, contributed approximately 5.4% of consolidated net income and 9.0% of NOI. Despite stable ownership percentages, the consistent presence of Austrian properties within the portfolio indicates a sustained exposure to risks such as foreign exchange fluctuations and regional economic changes, which could affect NOI contributions from international operations.",

Such international activities carry risks that are different from  those we face with our dom estic properties and operations.

F oreign C orrupt P ractices Act, and certain foreign countries, such as the U .K. Bribery Act, which could result in crim inal or civil sanctions and/or fines, negatively im pact our reputation, or require us to incur significant expenses to investigate;\n- differing lending practices;\n- differences in cultures and consum er retail behavior;\n- changes in applicable laws and regulations in the U nited States that affect international operations;\n- changes in applicable laws and regulations in these foreign jurisdictions;\n- difficulties in m anaging international operations;\n- obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; and\n- labor  discord,  political  or  civil  unrest,  acts  of  terrorism ,  epidem ics  and  pandem ics,  the  fear  of  spread  of  contagious diseases, supply chain disruptions or the threat of international boycotts.\n\nOur international activities represented approxim ately 5.4% of consolidated net incom e and 9.0% of our net operating incom e, or NOI, for the year ended D ecem ber 31, 2024.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG applied ASU 2021-01, which expanded the scope of ASU 2020-04 to include derivatives, allowing the company to utilize optional expedients for easing the transition away from LIBOR in its financial reporting. This early adoption enabled SPG to prepare for broader compliance with ASU 2020-04, which was extended through December 31, 2024. By 2023, SPG had fully elected the expedients under ASU 2020-04 in conjunction with transitioning certain debt instruments to alternative benchmark indexes. The company reported no material impact on its consolidated financial statements at adoption, indicating a smooth integration of these accounting updates. This shows that SPG's early application of ASU 2021-01 in 2022 facilitated a seamless compliance process under ASU 2020-04 in 2023, particularly in managing the transition of debt instruments.",

On February 18, 2021, the SPAC announced the pricing  of  its  initial  public  offering,  which  was  consummated  on  February  23,  2021,  generating  gross  proceeds  of $345.0 million, which have been placed in a trust account and is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in Investments held in trust - special purpose acquisition company.  The SPAC is a consolidated VIE which was formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination.  The Company accounts for the noncontrolling interest in the SPAC as noncontrolling redeemable interests as these instruments are redeemable at the option of the holder and  are  classified  as  temporary  equity  at  their  redemption  value  in  Simon's  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet in Limited partners preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests and in  the  Operating  Partnership's  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet  in  Preferred  units,  various  series,  at liquidation value, and noncontrolling redeemable interests.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform,' which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the US GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market  transition  from  LIBOR  and  other  interbank  offered  rates  to  alternative  reference  rates.  Additional  optional expedients, exceptions, and clarifications were created in ASU 2021-01. The guidance is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to any contract modifications or existing and new hedging relationships through December 31, 2022. We elected the expedients in conjunction with transitioning certain debt instruments, as discussed in note 7, to alternative benchmark indexes.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG had an interest in a European investee that owned 9 Designer Outlet properties in Europe, with SPG's ownership stakes ranging from 23% to 94%. By 2024, this number had increased to 12 Designer Outlet properties across Europe, with one of those properties now located in Austria. Despite this growth, SPG's ownership percentages in these properties still ranged from 23% to 94%, indicating a continuation of its mixed ownership strategy. The addition of an Austrian property expanded SPG's geographic footprint into a new European market within its international portfolio, which in 2024 represented 5.4% of consolidated net income and 9.0% of net operating income. This expansion suggests a strategic focus on geographic diversification through its European investee.",

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain of $58.6 million related to the disposition of certain assets of Kl\u00e9pierre. These transactions are included in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nWe  have  an  interest  in  a  European  investee  that  had  interests  in  11  Designer  Outlet  properties  as  of December 31, 2021, ten Designer Outlet properties as of December 31, 2020, and nine Designer Outlet properties as of December 31, 2019. Seven of which are consolidated by us as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our legal percentage ownership interests in these properties ranged from 23% to 94%. Due to certain redemption rights held by our venture partner, which will require us to purchase their interests under certain circumstances, the noncontrolling interest is presented (i) in the accompanying Simon consolidated balance sheets outside of equity in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties and (ii) in the accompanying Operating Partnership consolidated balance sheets within preferred units, various series, at liquidation value, and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties.\n\nOn January  1,  2021  our  European  investee  gained  control  of  Ochtrup  Designer  Outlets  as  a  result  of  the expiration of certain participating rights held by a venture partner. This resulted in the consolidation of the property, requiring a remeasurement of our previously held equity interest to fair value and the recognition of a non-cash gain of  $3.7  million  in  earnings  during  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  which  includes  amounts  reclassified  from  accumulated other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  related  to  the  currency  translation  adjustment  previously  recorded  on  our investment. The gain is included in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The determination of the fair value consisted of Level 2 and 3 inputs and was predominately allocated to investment property.\n\nIn addition, we have a 50.0% noncontrolling interest in a European property management and development company that provides services to the Designer Outlet properties.\n\nWe also have minority interests in Value Retail PLC and affiliated entities, which own or have interests in and operate nine luxury outlets located throughout Europe and we also have a direct minority ownership in three of those outlets. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of these equity instruments without readily determinable fair values was $140.8 million and is included in deferred costs and other assets.\n\n## Asian Joint Ventures\n\nWe  conduct  our  international  Premium  Outlet  operations  in  Japan  through  a  joint  venture  with  Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd.

In addition, the amendments require that a public business entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | January 1, 2023, the Company adopted, using a prospective approach.                     | The new guidance has reduced the complexity involved with evaluating and accounting for certain loan modifications.

The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, with certain exceptions. ASU 2021-01 amends the scope of the recent reference rate reform guidance. New optional expedients allow derivative instruments impacted by changes in the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment to qualify for certain optional relief. The amendments in ASU 2022-06 extend the sunset date of the reference rate reform optional expedients and exceptions to December 31, 2024. | Effective for contract modifications made between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2024. | The guidance has reduced the operational and financial impacts of contract modifications that replace a reference rate, such as London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), affected by reference rate reform. Contract modifications to replace reference rates affected by the reform occurred during 2021, 2022 and 2023.
