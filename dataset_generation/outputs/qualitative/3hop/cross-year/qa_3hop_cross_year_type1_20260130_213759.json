      "question": "How did the change in coal-fired capacity at Duke Energy Indiana's Edwardsport plant from 2022 to 2023 reflect Duke Energy's broader fuel sourcing strategy in Indiana, particularly regarding coal supply contracts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Indiana's Edwardsport plant had a capacity of 595 MW of coal-fired generation, which decreased to 578 MW in 2023. This reduction aligns with Duke Energy's broader strategy in Indiana, where it reported having an adequate supply of coal under contracts to meet its risk management guidelines, but also noted that coal inventory levels may fluctuate due to volatility in natural gas prices and associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch. The slight decrease in coal-fired capacity at Edwardsport suggests a measured transition possibly influenced by fuel market dynamics and strategic flexibility in coal contracts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Edwardsport: Edwardsport had 595 MW of coal-fired capacity in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Edwardsport \u2192 Indiana: Edwardsport is a coal-fired plant located in Indiana.",
        "Hop 3: Indiana \u2190 DUK(2023): In 2023, Duke Energy Indiana reported adequate coal supply under contracts, but noted fluctuating inventory levels due to natural gas price volatility."

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company incurred a $96 million pre-tax charge due to the disallowance of certain capital investments at Nicor Gas, its Illinois-based gas distribution subsidiary. This negatively impacted financial performance and likely constrained investment capacity in the short term. By 2024, Nicor Gas continued to operate in Illinois, serving 2,276 thousand customers with 34.7 thousand miles of pipeline. However, gas cost recovery revenues in Illinois decreased due to lower natural gas prices and warmer weather reducing demand. Despite these challenges, Nicor Gas maintained its weather or revenue normalization mechanisms, which helped stabilize income despite fluctuating consumption. The 2023 capital investment disallowance and 2024 revenue reductions both reflect external pressures on regulated utility returns in Illinois.",

The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See \"Cost of Natural Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\nRevenues from gas marketing services decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower commodity prices.\n\n## Customer Count\n\nThe number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations' and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.\n\nThe following table provides the number of customers served by Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO reported that the Garland Solar Storage project, with a nameplate capacity of 88 MW, was under construction with expected commercial operation dates (COD) spanning September 2021 through the first quarter of 2022. By 2023, SO confirmed that the project had been completed, with COD finalized between September 2021 and February 2022. This indicates that SO successfully executed its energy storage strategy within the planned timeframe, transitioning the project from construction to full operation while maintaining the stated capacity.

By 2023, NEE disclosed capital expenditures specifically for new wind projects and repowering of existing ones totaling approximately 2,621 MW, indicating a strategic emphasis on expanding wind generation capacity. NEP's role as an investment vehicle allowed NEE to maintain exposure to wind projects without full consolidation, while NEE's direct capital commitments in 2023 reflect a more aggressive push into wind energy development.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's risk management activities included exposure to market risks such as commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices, with foreign currency derivatives being part of the broader 'Risk Management Activities' category. By 2024, foreign currency derivatives were specifically identified and classified as Level 2 instruments in the fair value hierarchy, valued using financial models with observable inputs such as forward foreign currency rate curves, notional amounts, and counterparty credit quality. This reflects a more detailed and structured approach to foreign currency risk management within the company's overall financial risk framework.",

Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.\n\nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\n\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, 'Risk Factors,' and 'Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information' for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy's exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the effects of regulation, commodity contract size and length, market liquidity, market conditions, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 17. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nFair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between m arket participants at the m easurem ent date. T he fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. F air value m easurem ents use m arket data or assum ptions m arket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assum ptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. T hese inputs m ay be readily observable, corroborated by m arket data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques m axim ize the use of observable inputs and m inim ize the use of unobservable inputs. A m idm arket pricing convention (the m idpoint price between bid and ask prices) is perm itted for use as a practical expedient.\n\nFair value m easurem ents are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy as defined by G AAP . C ertain investm ents are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. These investm ents are m easured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. T he net asset value is derived based on the investm ent cost, less any im pairm ent, plus or m inus changes resulting from  observable price changes for an identical or sim ilar investm ent of the sam e issuer.\n\nFair value accounting guidance perm its entities to elect to m easure certain financial instrum ents that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity m ethod investm ents or the C om pany's own debt, at fair value. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants have not elected to record any of these item s at fair value.\n\nValuation m ethods of the prim ary fair value m easurem ents disclosed below are as follows.\n\n## Investments in equity securities\n\nThe m ajority of investm ents in equity securities are valued using Level 1 m easurem ents. Investm ents in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. P rincipal active m arkets for equity prices include published exchanges such as the N YSE  and N asdaq Stock M arket. F oreign equity prices are translated from  their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active m arket. T here was no after-hours m arket activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value m easurem ents.\n\n## Investments in debt securities\n\nMost investm ents in debt securities are valued using Level 2 m easurem ents because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the term s of the debt instrum ent (m aturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the m arket for a particular fixed-incom e security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurem ent is Level 3.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nCommodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. C om m odity derivatives with observable forward curves are classified as Level 2. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term  of the contract and the unobservable period had m ore than an insignificant im pact on the valuation, the com m odity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustm ents for natural gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustm ents for electricity sales contracts. D uke E nergy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estim ate the fair value of certain com m odity contracts by a m arket participant price verification procedure. T his procedure provides a com parison of internal forward com m odity curves to m arket participant generated curves.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nMost over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial m odels that utilize observable inputs for sim ilar instrum ents and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional am ounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties.\n\n## Foreign currency derivatives\n\nMost over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives are valued using financial m odels that utilize observable inputs for sim ilar instrum ents and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward foreign currency rate curves, notional am ounts, foreign currency rates and credit quality of the counterparties.\n\n## Other fair value considerations\n\nSee Note 2 for further inform ation on the valuation of the C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups. See N ote 12 for a discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NEE reported $377 million in fair value assets for forward contracts - gas, valued using discounted cash flow with a weighted-average forward price of $3/MMBtu. By 2024, this fair value asset decreased to $296 million, while the weighted-average forward price increased to $4/MMBtu.

      "question": "How did SO's investment in the Tranquillity Solar Storage project evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its battery energy storage capacity and completion timeline?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SO reported that the Tranquillity Solar Storage project, located in Fresno County, CA, had a nameplate capacity of 72 MW and was completed between November 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. By 2024, the project was still referenced in SO's portfolio as a completed battery energy storage system with the same 72 MW capacity, indicating that the company maintained its stake and that the project remained operational. This shows a stable investment in the same asset without capacity expansion, with the project transitioning from construction to full operation within the expected timeline.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Battery Energy Storage System: In 2022, SO reported the Tranquillity Solar Storage project as a battery energy storage system with a 72 MW capacity, completed between November 2021 and Q1 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Battery Energy Storage System \u2192 Tranquillity Solar Storage: The Tranquillity Solar Storage project is explicitly categorized under SO's battery energy storage systems, with a defined capacity and completion schedule.",
        "Hop 3: Tranquillity Solar Storage \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, SO's filings still list Tranquillity Solar Storage as a completed battery energy storage project with the same 72 MW capacity, indicating ongoing ownership and operational status."

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's regulatory exposure to FERC through KO Transmission change from 2023 to 2024, and what impact did the divestiture of KO Transmission's pipeline have on Duke Energy's natural gas infrastructure and compliance obligations under FERC regulations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy was subject to FERC regulations through its ownership of KO Transmission, which operated a 90-mile interstate natural gas pipeline regulated by FERC. KO Transmission was sold in February 2023, transferring ownership of its pipeline facilities to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC at book value. By 2024, Duke Energy no longer owned KO Transmission, thereby reducing its direct FERC-regulated infrastructure exposure. This divestiture likely altered Duke Energy's compliance obligations under FERC, as it no longer operated that specific pipeline asset, shifting focus to other FERC-regulated investments such as Hardy Storage and Pine Needle. The removal of KO Transmission from Duke's portfolio reflects a strategic shift in its natural gas infrastructure positioning under FERC oversight.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 FERC Regulations: Duke Energy was subject to FERC regulations due to its ownership of KO Transmission, which operated a FERC-regulated interstate pipeline.",
        "Hop 2: FERC Regulations \u2192 KO Transmission: KO Transmission was directly regulated by FERC as an interstate pipeline operator, with its 90-mile pipeline interconnecting with other FERC-regulated systems.",
        "Hop 3: KO Transmission \u2190 DUK(2024): By 2024, Duke Energy had divested KO Transmission's pipeline facilities, removing its direct FERC-regulated exposure through that entity and altering its natural gas infrastructure profile."

A significant com petitive factor is price. G U &amp;I 's prim ary product com petition is with electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively im pact com petitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consum er.

C om petition between natural gas and other form s of energy is also based on efficiency, perform ance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors.

T hese factors in turn could decrease the dem and for natural gas, im pair G U &amp;I's ability to attract new custom ers and cause existing custom ers to switch to other form s of energy or to bypass G U &amp;I's system s in favor of alternative com petitive sources. T his could result in slow or no custom er growth for G U &amp;I and could cause custom ers to reduce or cease using natural gas, thereby reducing G U &amp;I's ability to m ake capital expenditures and otherwise grow its business, adversely affecting its earnings.\n\n## Natural Gas Investments\n\nDuke E nergy, through its G U &amp;I segm ent, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal T rail. Sabal T rail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal T rail N atural G as P ipeline, which is regulated by FE R C  and traverses Alabam a, G eorgia, and F lorida to transport natural gas to F lorida. D uke E nergy, also through its G U &amp;I segm ent, has a 47% equity ownership interest in AC P  and investm ents in various renewable natural gas joint ventures. D uke E nergy determ ined that it would no longer invest in AC P , and the construction of the AC P  pipeline, in 2020.\n\nGU&amp;I has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in C ardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in N orth C arolina regulated by the N C U C , a 45% equity ownership in P ine N eedle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in N orth C arolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in H ardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and H am pshire counties in W est Virginia. P ine N eedle and H ardy Storage are regulated by F E R C .\n\nGU&amp;I sold all of KO  T ransm ission's pipeline facilities and related real property to C olum bia G as T ransm ission, LLC  in F ebruary 2023 for approxim ately book value.\n\nSee Notes 4, 13 and 18 to the C onsolidated Financial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters,\" \"Investm ents in U nconsolidated Affiliates\" and \"Variable Interest E ntities,\" respectively, for further inform ation on D uke E nergy's and G U &amp;I's natural gas investm ents.\n\n## Inventory\n\nGU&amp;I m ust m aintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to custom ers. As of D ecem ber 31, 2024, the inventory balance for G U &amp;I was $95 m illion. F or more inform ation on inventory, see N ote 1 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"Sum m ary of Significant Accounting P olicies.\"\n\n## Regulation\n\n## State\n\nThe state utility com m issions approve rates for D uke E nergy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. T he state utility com m issions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of G U &amp;I's natural gas distribution facilities. C P C N s issued by the state utility com m issions or other governm ent agencies, as applicable, authorize GU&amp;I to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale custom ers. P rior approval from  the relevant state utility com m ission is required for G U &amp;I to issue securities. T he underlying concept of utility ratem aking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\n\nI n addition to am ounts collected from  custom ers through approved base rates, each of the state utility com m issions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective com m ission determ ines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\n\nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by G U &amp;I. D ue to the associated regulatory treatm ent and the m ethod allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from  year to year have no m aterial im pact on operating results of G U &amp;I, unless a com m ission finds a portion of such costs to have been im prudent. H owever, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from  custom ers can adversely im pact the tim ing of cash flows of G U &amp;I. G U &amp;I also has various regulatory m echanism s in place to track and recover certain costs associated with capital investm ents including the IM R  in N orth C arolina, AR M  in T ennessee, and C E P  R ider in O hio.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's use of short-term bank debt by Nicor Gas in 2022 compare to Nicor Gas's role as a borrower under Southern Company's credit arrangements in 2024, and what does this evolution indicate about Southern Company's financial strategy for its gas operations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that Nicor Gas had $300 million in short-term bank debt with a weighted average interest rate of 0.7%, indicating a direct reliance on short-term financing for its gas operations. This debt was explicitly listed under Nicor Gas's liabilities, showing a localized approach to funding. By 2024, Nicor Gas's role had evolved: it became a borrower under Southern Company's broader $700 million credit arrangement expiring in 2029, which was restricted for working capital needs. This shift from standalone short-term borrowing to being part of a larger, multi-year committed credit structure suggests a strategic move toward centralized financial management and improved liquidity support for gas operations.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company reported that property, plant, and equipment values were reduced by regulatory disallowances and impairments, indicating a baseline level of regulatory risk exposure. By 2023, Nicor Gas\u2014part of Southern Company\u2019s gas distribution operations\u2014faced a specific $96 million pre-tax charge due to the disallowance of certain capital investments, which directly impacted the gas distribution segment. Additionally, Southern Company recorded a $72 million after-tax charge tied to this disallowance, further affecting earnings. This evolution shows that regulatory disallowances, which were previously a general risk factor in 2022, became a concrete financial burden in 2023, particularly for Nicor Gas, leading to measurable impacts on segment performance and capitalized investment values.",

In 2023, NEP issued an additional $500 million in December 2022, increasing the total outstanding convertible notes and thereby amplifying the dilutive effect on NEE's equity structure.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's nuclear units represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. These nuclear operations were subject to significant financial risks, including decommissioning costs, regulatory fines, and capital expenditures for security and maintenance. By 2024, the output from nuclear units increased to 25% and 34% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. This increase in nuclear generation corresponded with continued exposure to financial risks, including potential costs exceeding decommissioning trusts and insurance coverage, as well as the possibility of substantial capital expenditures due to NRC regulations or incidents. The evolution of nuclear output and its associated financial risks indicates a growing reliance on nuclear energy despite the persistent and potentially increasing financial exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

Achievement of these goals is dependent on various factors, many of which the Southern Company system does not control, including load growth across the Southern Company system's service territory, energy policy and regulations, natural gas prices, and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to economically transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet through a diverse portfolio of resources including low-carbon and carbon-free resources; making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing to implement effective energy efficiency and demand response programs; customer demand for carbon-free energy; implementing initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution emissions; continuing research and development with a focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future. There is no guarantee that the Southern Company system will achieve these goals.\n\nSee MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters - Environmental Laws and Regulations -Greenhouse Gases\" in Item 7 herein for additional information.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, inability to maintain reliability consistent with customer ex pectations as the traditional electric operating companies transition their generating fleets in support of the Southern Company system's net zero goal, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and catastrophic events such as fires, including wildfires, earthquakes, ex plosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, wars, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, six nuclear units. The eight units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 25% and 34% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2024. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives or license extensions and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and significant capital ex penditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants.

      "question": "How did the expansion of Duke Energy's storm recovery property through new bond issuances in 2024 relate to evolving state legislative frameworks, and what does this indicate about the company's increasing reliance on regulatory mechanisms to manage storm-related financial risks?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy used storm recovery property\u2014created under state legislation and NCUC financing orders\u2014to issue $237 million and $770 million in bonds, financing unrecovered storm costs from 2018 and 2019. By 2024, the company expanded this model to South Carolina with the formation of Duke Energy Progress SC Storm Funding, LLC, which issued $177 million in bonds to cover storm costs from 2014 through 2022. This expansion was enabled by new state legislation and a PSC SC financing order, indicating a strategic shift toward broader regulatory-backed mechanisms to manage long-standing storm-related liabilities. The 2024 risk factor disclosures also highlight Duke Energy\u2019s growing sensitivity to state regulatory frameworks, as the company depends on these mechanisms to recover costs and maintain financial stability amid increasing climate-related risks.",

D uke E nergy is working to m eet growing and evolving custom er energy needs while balancing custom er reliability and affordability, and other priorities including the need to m odernize its fleet and the regulatory construct. D uke E nergy is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, econom ic and com petitive uncertainties and contingencies, m any of which are beyond its control and may m ake those goals difficult to achieve.\n\nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable D uke E nergy to reduce its carbon em issions. F or exam ple, D uke E nergy anticipates that its nuclear stations in N orth C arolina and South C arolina will continue to qualify for significant tax incentives in the form  of nuclear production tax credits under the IR A. N uclear energy is a reliable and clean energy source and nuclear tax incentives allowed under the IR A, including nuclear production tax credits, are expected to reduce the cost of the energy transition for our custom ers. If such nuclear production tax credits were elim inated or reduced, it could negatively im pact our ability to return the anticipated cost benefits to custom ers.\n\nAdditionally, new E P A rules issued in April 2024 im pose stringent G H G  em ission reduction standards, revised air toxic lim its, and wastewater discharge lim itations that m ay im pact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational tim eline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies m ay be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transm ission and distribution upgrades needed to accom m odate the build out of large volum es of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the C om pany to continue to retire existing carbon em itting assets or m ake investm ents in new generating capacity. T he C om pany m ay be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on tim e. In addition, new technologies that are not yet com m ercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, D uke E nergy's ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\n\nMeeting the evolving and growing energy needs of our custom ers will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, m ay challenge our ability to m eet custom er expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environm ent, particularly as dem and increases. O ur nuclear fleet is central to our ability to m eet these objectives and custom er expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond m idcentury. F ailure to receive approval from  the N R C  for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\n\nAs a consequence, D uke E nergy m ay not be able to fully im plem ent or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which m ay have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\n\n## REGULATORY, LE GISLATIVE  AND LE GAL R ISK S\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of N orth C arolina, South C arolina, F lorida, O hio, T ennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility com m issions, retail electric and natural gas rates m ay be subject to review and possible reduction by the com m issions, which m ay decrease the D uke E nergy R egistrants' earnings. Additionally, if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a tim ely basis, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be negatively im pacted. D ifferences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as N orth C arolina and South C arolina in D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' service territory, m ay also result in failure to recover costs.\n\nI f legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the D uke E nergy R egistrants' exclusive rights to serve their regulated custom ers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively im pacted. F ederal and state regulations, laws, com m ercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to prom ote and expand the use of E E measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in D uke E nergy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in D uke E nergy service territories or result in custom ers leaving the electric distribution system  and an increase in custom er net energy m etering, which allows custom ers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit am ount. O ver tim e, custom er adoption of these technologies could result in D uke E nergy not being able to fully recover the costs and investm ent in generation.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy's consistent classification of debt investments as AFS in both 2022 and 2024 suggests a stable investment strategy focused on holding these securities for the long term, rather than for active trading or short-term profit. The immaterial realized gains and losses from sales of AFS securities in 2024 further support this, indicating minimal turnover and a passive management approach. This consistency in accounting treatment and investment behavior implies that Duke Energy is maintaining a conservative and stable portfolio strategy for its debt holdings, likely aligned with its broader risk management and capital preservation goals.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 AFS: In 2022, Duke Energy classified debt investments as AFS, indicating a long-term holding strategy.",

        "Hop 3: Debt Investments \u2190 DUK(2024): In 2024, the company continued using AFS for debt investments, with immaterial realized gains/losses, showing no significant change in strategy."

      "answer": "The divestiture of KO Transmission in February 2023, which included the sale of all pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC at book value, significantly reduced Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s FERC-related compliance obligations. Since KO Transmission was previously subject to FERC regulations as an interstate pipeline operator, its sale removed a major source of regulatory risk and compliance burden. In 2024, Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s exposure to FERC regulations was notably lower, reflecting the absence of interstate pipeline operations and the associated capital and operational compliance costs.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 KO Transmission: Duke Energy Ohio owned KO Transmission, an interstate pipeline company engaged in natural gas transportation and subject to FERC regulations. The company divested KO Transmission on February 1, 2023, selling all pipeline assets at book value.",
        "Hop 2: KO Transmission \u2192 FERC Regulations: KO Transmission was directly regulated by FERC due to its interstate pipeline operations, requiring compliance with FERC\u2019s rules and oversight.",

By 2023, the company maintained this classification but introduced a distinction for debt securities within Investment Trusts, where unrealized losses were immediately recognized and deferred to regulatory accounts due to lack of control over day-to-day management.

In 2023, Southern Linc was explicitly noted as marketing digital wireless communications services to the public, suggesting that the capital previously allocated to fiber optic construction was redirected toward expanding their digital wireless offerings.

The increase was primarily due to a $16 million increase at the parent company primarily related to director compensation expenses and an $11 million increase at PowerSecure primarily associated with higher bad debt expense, partially offset by a $17 million decrease at Southern Linc primarily related to the design and construction of a fiber optic system completed in 2020.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nEarnings from equity method investments for these other business activities increased $14 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in investment income at Southern Holdings.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense for these other business activities increased $17 million, or 2.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase of approximately $64 million related to higher average outstanding long-term borrowings, partially offset by decreases of approximately $34 million due to lower interest rates and $6 million due to a reduction in losses associated with the extinguishment of debt at the parent company. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Impairment of Leveraged Leases\n\nImpairment charges related to leveraged lease investments at Southern Holdings decreased $199 million, or 96.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company\u2019s energy generation segment (Southern Power) had solar and wind facilities whose revenues were directly dependent on weather conditions affecting energy output, as noted in the 2022 10-K. In 2023, the gas distribution segment (Southern Company Gas) saw a $1.2 billion revenue decrease, partly due to lower gas volumes sold, which were influenced by weather-dependent customer consumption patterns. While Southern Power\u2019s weather risk was tied to generation output, Southern Company Gas mitigated some exposure through regulatory mechanisms like weather normalization and fixed-charge rate designs, particularly outside of Atlanta Gas Light. The evolution shows a shift in weather sensitivity from generation capacity in 2022 to consumption volume in 2023, with both segments managing exposure through different strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Operating Revenues\n\nTotal operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.\n\n## Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue\n\nCapacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.\n\nEnergy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.\n\n## Solar and Wind Energy Revenue\n\nSouthern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company held a strategic stake in PowerSecure, which recorded a $119 million goodwill impairment due to declining macroeconomic conditions that reduced sales growth and cash flow projections. Despite this impairment, PowerSecure continued to play a role in Southern Company's broader energy portfolio by providing distributed energy and resilience solutions, including microgrid deployments. By 2024, Southern Company explicitly highlighted 'distributed energy and resilience solutions'\u2014a service line directly tied to PowerSecure\u2014as a key component of its 'All Other' business segment, signaling a strategic emphasis on these offerings for commercial, industrial, and utility customers.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Development Projects\n\nIn November 2024, Southern Power committed to a development project to repower 200 MWs of the 299-MW Kay Wind facility located in Kay County, Oklahoma. The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $96 million associated with the disallowance of certain capital investments at Nicor Gas, which likely constrained Nicor Gas\u2019 financial flexibility. By 2024, this had a direct bearing on the structure of its commercial paper programs, as Nicor Gas became the borrower under a $700 million credit arrangement (part of a $2.45 billion combined arrangement) specifically restricted for working capital needs. Additionally, $100 million of a separate credit arrangement expiring in 2025 was also allocated to Nicor Gas, indicating a strategic reallocation of liquidity support to stabilize its working capital position following the prior year\u2019s impairment. This evolution shows how earlier financial pressures led to a more defined and restricted use of short-term financing mechanisms in 2024.",

Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas explicitly stated that debt investments were classified as AFS (Available for Sale), while equity investments were classified as FV-NI (Fair Value through Net Income). By 2024, Duke Energy Indiana maintained the same AFS classification for debt investments, but the context expanded to include details about realized gains and losses from FV-NI and AFS securities being immaterial across 2022\u20132024. Additionally, Duke Energy Florida received reimbursements from the NDTF (Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund) in 2024 for decommissioning costs related to Crystal River Unit 3. This suggests that while the accounting policy remained stable, the company's broader investment and capital allocation strategy incorporated more passive tracking of gains/losses, possibly to focus on strategic decommissioning and regulatory reimbursements.",

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mississippi Power Company, a subsidiary of Southern Company, explicitly stated it was not required to send an annual report or proxy statement to its parent and would not file one with the SEC. By 2024, Mississippi Power Company was among the Southern subsidiaries that 'meets the conditions set forth in General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K' and thus qualified for the reduced disclosure format under General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d). This shift indicates that Southern Company's regulatory reporting posture evolved from full exclusion of certain subsidiaries from annual reporting in 2022 to a more structured, streamlined compliance approach by 2024, where even non-public subsidiaries like Mississippi Power Company were brought into a standardized, reduced-format disclosure process.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Progress financed unrecovered storm costs in North Carolina by issuing $770 million of senior secured bonds through DEPNCSF, a special purpose entity, and acquiring storm recovery property related to costs from 2018 and 2019. By 2024, Duke expanded this model to South Carolina, forming DEPSC SF and issuing $177 million in new bonds to recover costs from 2014 through 2022. This demonstrates a strategic shift toward broader geographic coverage of storm recovery financing, with DEPSC SF being consolidated under Duke Energy Progress, continuing the use of bankruptcy-remote entities to securitize storm-related regulatory assets.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress transferred storm-related regulatory assets to special-purpose subsidiaries, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF, which acquired storm recovery property that included the right to impose and collect non-bypassable customer charges to repay bond obligations. This acquisition enabled the structured financing in 2024, where Duke Energy Progress issued $177 million in storm recovery bonds following regulatory approval from the PSC SC. The storm recovery property\u2014secured by customer charges\u2014became the sole source of repayment for the bonds, mirroring the earlier 2021 issuance structure. The 2024 bond issuance directly relied on the legal and financial framework established through the 2023 property acquisition, ensuring compliance with state securitization rules and enabling a predictable recovery mechanism through customer billing.",

I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy utilized Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), such as CRC, to manage credit risk and account receivables, particularly in the context of customer defaults and the economic fallout from the pandemic, with losses first absorbed by the equity of the VIE and then by subordinated retained interests. By 2024, the company had expanded its use of VIEs through the formation and consolidation of special purpose entities like DECNC SF, which were specifically created to issue storm recovery bonds. These bonds, such as the $177 million issued by DEPSC SF in April 2024, were used to finance unrecovered regulatory assets tied to storm costs incurred from 2014 through 2022. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from general credit risk mitigation to a more targeted financial mechanism for recovering storm-related expenses through non-bypassable customer charges, while maintaining insulation from direct liability as bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Carolinas or Progress.",

The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Derivatives and Hedging,' for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\n\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment as a result of the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the company has resumed standard payment arrangement options . The Duke Energy Registrants are still monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties' abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants have observed a significant increase in utility account arrears as of December 31, 2021. There is an expectation of an increase in charge-offs in the future and the Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Revenue,\" respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Variable Interest Entities.'\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.\n\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate selfinsured retention. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Guarantees and Indemnifications,' for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty.",

      "answer": "Nicor Gas significantly reduced its notes payable from $392 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024, while also lowering its weighted average interest rate from 5.5% to 4.6%. This contributed to Southern Company's broader strategy of reducing total notes payable from $2,314 million in 2023 to $1,338 million in 2024, with a corresponding drop in the weighted average interest rate from 5.7% to 4.8%. This coordinated shift suggests a targeted refinancing effort across the company's subsidiaries, with Nicor Gas playing a role in lowering the consolidated interest burden by reducing high-cost debt.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

      "question": "Despite Southern Company's 2022 environmental compliance costs being partially passed through to regulated rates, which could reduce demand, how did commercial customer sales perform in 2023, particularly at Southern Linc where sales increased by $24 million, and what does this suggest about the resilience or sensitivity of commercial demand to regulatory-driven cost recovery?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company faced significant environmental compliance costs that were partially recovered through regulated rates, raising concerns that this could reduce customer demand. However, in 2023, commercial customer sales showed growth, with Southern Linc reporting a $24 million increase in revenue tied to commercial customers. This suggests that, despite the potential negative impact of higher rates on demand, commercial customer demand remained resilient or was not significantly affected by the cost recovery mechanisms in place.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Environmental Requirements: Southern Company incurred environmental compliance costs in 2022, which were partially recovered through rate mechanisms.",
        "Hop 2: Environmental Requirements \u2192 Commercial Customers: The 2023 filing noted that increased costs recovered through regulated rates could reduce demand, including from commercial and industrial customers affected by environmental regulations.",
        "Hop 3: Commercial Customers \u2190 SO(2023): Southern Linc saw a $24 million increase in sales to commercial customers in 2023, indicating that demand was not negatively impacted as feared."

The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand, which could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated gas distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience underrecovered fuel and/or purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred.\n\n## The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants.\n\nThe consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.\n\nOutside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences, legislation, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy. For example, some cities in the United States have banned the use of natural gas in new construction.\n\nBoth federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy efficiency.\n\nCustomers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts.\n\nIn addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available methods and experience to incorporate the effects of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects.\n\nThe operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary Registrant.\n\nElectric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.\n\nVolatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, and the natural gas distribution and storage facilities of Southern Company Gas. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states which could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.\n\nIn the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company reported that its South Carolina net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards were set to begin expiring in 2036, providing a multi-year window to generate taxable income in that jurisdiction. By 2023, Southern Company Gas maintained a 50% ownership interest in SNG, a major natural gas pipeline connecting supply basins to markets across the Southeast, including South Carolina. This investment likely supports regional infrastructure and operations that can generate taxable income over time. The timing and geographic alignment of the SNG investment with the South Carolina NOL expiration in 2036 suggests a strategic effort to utilize future taxable income in the state to offset previously carried losses, thereby optimizing its regional tax profile.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company disclosed that fair value estimation for asset retirement obligations (AROs) required significant judgment, particularly when quoted market prices were unavailable. They relied on present value techniques, using estimates of future cash outlays discounted at a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, especially for obligations related to ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning, and landfill sites. In 2024, the company disclosed that similar principles applied to the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, where considerable judgment was also required in interpreting market data and selecting assumptions, echoing the valuation challenges noted in the 2023 ARO disclosures. The MET 2023 chunk further supports this by emphasizing that differences in valuation methodologies could materially affect fair value estimates, reinforcing the consistency in the company's approach to fair value measurement across different asset classes and time periods.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company operated under a structure where SCS provided specialized services at cost, including executive advisory, engineering, operations, and IT services. In 2024, Southern Company continued to depend on SCS for the same categories of services, with costs still being rendered at direct or allocated cost, as evidenced by the consistent listing of these service categories and cost-based billing. The lack of change in service types and cost methodology indicates that Southern Company maintained a stable internal cost structure and continued to rely on centralized service delivery through SCS, suggesting a strategic commitment to internal resource optimization rather than outsourcing or restructuring. This continuity in service delivery and cost treatment reflects a deliberate internal cost management strategy focused on maintaining control and efficiency across the company's operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's (SO) financing structure evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to Nicor Gas' access to credit arrangements and its impact on working capital flexibility?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Nicor Gas obtained financing separately without credit support from affiliates and maintained its own commercial paper program to support working capital needs, with restrictions on affiliate loans and dividends up to $1.7 billion in retained earnings. By 2024, Nicor Gas had a $700 million credit allocation under Southern Company Gas' $1.5 billion committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029, which could be adjusted in coordination with Southern Company Gas Capital, along with a separate $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. This evolution reflects an increase in structured credit access for Nicor Gas under SO's broader financing umbrella, while still maintaining operational and financial separation to meet regulatory constraints.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company recorded a $96 million pre-tax charge related to disallowed capital investments at Nicor Gas, indicating regulatory pushback on cost recovery. Despite this, the bad debt rider in place for Nicor Gas\u2014approved by the Illinois Commission\u2014continued to provide a mechanism for recovering differences between actual bad debt experience and the benchmark used in base rates. By 2024, the bad debt rider remained in effect and was described in similar terms, suggesting that while Nicor Gas faced regulatory risk as evidenced by the disallowance, the utility maintained a structured recovery mechanism to offset credit risk exposure. This implies a dual dynamic: regulatory scrutiny on capital spending increased in 2023, yet the existing bad debt rider continued to serve as a financial buffer in 2024, stabilizing cash flows despite potential credit volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nuncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.\n\nCredit risk ex posure at Nicor G as is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 14 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk ex posure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest ex posure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit ex posure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, and interest rates. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets (included in \"Other\" or shown separately as \"Risk Management Activities\") and are measured at fair value. See Note 13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and Southern Company Gas' bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are ex cluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the \"normal\" scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.\n\nThe Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nThe purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation",

These subsidiaries issued $237 million and $770 million in senior secured bonds, respectively, using the storm recovery property\u2014granted by state legislation and NCUC orders\u2014as collateral. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress had issued an additional $177 million in storm recovery bonds, this time through a South Carolina securitization process tied to specific storms like Florence and Michael. The earlier acquisition of storm recovery property in 2022 demonstrated a successful financing mechanism that likely informed the 2024 bond issuance, with both events relying on the legal framework that allows storm recovery charges to be collected from retail customers as the sole source of repayment.

I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power Company used the reduced disclosure format under General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K as part of Southern Company's consolidated filing, indicating alignment with a streamlined reporting structure. However, in 2023, Georgia Power maintained its own distinct signatory block with separate executive and director representations, including Kimberly S. Greene as Chairman, President, and CEO, and Melissa K. Caen as Attorney-in-fact, signed on February 14, 2024. This suggests that despite the prior year\u2019s consolidated format, Georgia Power retained a level of operational and governance independence in its reporting obligations. The continued presence of its own signature block reinforces that Georgia Power operates as a distinct registrant within the Southern Company system, with its own accountability framework.",

By 2024, while still using discounted cash flow for valuation, the high range of unobservable forward price inputs decreased to $22 per MWh. This reflects a narrowing in the expected volatility or variability of congestion-related pricing, likely due to market stabilization or improved forecasting.

      "question": "What does the shift from pass-through tax expenses tied to natural gas revenues in 2021 to regulatory disallowances in 2023 at Nicor Gas indicate about the changing financial pressures and regulatory environment for Southern Company's natural gas distribution segment?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Southern Company experienced a $19 million increase in taxes other than income taxes, driven by a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses at Nicor Gas due to higher natural gas revenues, which were passed through to customers and had no impact on net income. However, by 2023, the regulatory environment had shifted, with Nicor Gas facing approximately $24 million in regulatory disallowances that directly impacted earnings. This change from pass-through tax expenses to regulatory disallowances suggests a more stringent regulatory stance, where increased revenues are no longer neutralized through cost recovery but instead result in financial penalties or restrictions, signaling a tightening regulatory climate for Southern Company's gas distribution operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [SO](2022) \u2192 [Nicor Gas]: In 2021, Nicor Gas saw higher natural gas revenues leading to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses, which were passed through to customers.",
        "Hop 2: [Nicor Gas] \u2192 [Regulatory Disallowances]: Nicor Gas was directly impacted by regulatory disallowances that affected earnings, indicating a shift in how revenues were treated by regulators.",
        "Hop 3: [Regulatory Disallowances] \u2190 [SO](2023): In 2023, Southern Company faced a $24 million financial impact from these regulatory disallowances at Nicor Gas, reflecting a change in regulatory policy or enforcement."

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

      "answer": "In 2020, as reported in the 2022 filing, the Reading wind project had a nameplate capacity of 200 MW and was completed in May 2020 with a 12-year power purchase agreement (PPA). At that time, it was part of Southern Power\u2019s broader wind portfolio, which included other projects like Skookumchuck (136 MW, 20-year PPA) and Glass Sands (118 MW, 12-year PPA). By 2024, the Reading project was described as part of a tax equity partnership in which Southern Power was the controlling partner, along with other wind facilities like Skookumchuck and Wildhorse Mountain. Southern Power consolidated these entities, and Reading was specifically noted as being owned through a tax equity partnership where SO maintained control. This evolution shows a strategic shift toward structured tax equity partnerships while retaining operational control, aligning with SO's broader trend of consolidating wind assets under controlled partnerships.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO's subsidiary Georgia Power had a $42 million capacity purchase commitment tied to MEAG Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, indicating reliance on MEAG Power for part of its electricity supply chain. By 2023, SO's filings showed a shift toward self-owned generation and third-party purchases, including Alabama Power's new 100 MW capacity service to PowerSouth and Georgia Power's joint generation facilities with OPC. This diversification coincided with a 0.7% increase in weather-adjusted residential KWH sales and a 7.1% rise in commercial KWH sales, suggesting that the more flexible and potentially scalable supply chain may have better supported growing customer demand, particularly in the commercial sector.",

See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner holding the same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 76,289 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.",

The agreement includes combined operations (including joint commitment and dispatch) and real-time energy sales and purchases and is expected to create energy cost savings and enhanced system reliability for both parties. Projected revenues are expected to offset any increased administrative costs incurred by Alabama Power. Under the agreement, Alabama Power has the right to participate in a portion of PowerSouth's future incremental load growth.                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Alabama Power also has a separate agreement with PowerSouth involving interconnection between their systems.

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company (SO) held a $1,202 million investment in SNG, a natural gas pipeline joint venture that operates across several southern states including Alabama. SNG plays a critical role in supplying natural gas to power generation facilities. In 2024, SO reported $234 million in PPA energy revenues and $156 million in PPA capacity revenues from electricity sales in Alabama, primarily through long-term PPAs. These PPAs are tied to natural gas-fired generation facilities, which depend on reliable gas supply infrastructure like SNG. The continued investment in SNG in 2023 suggests a strategic alignment to ensure stable gas supply for power generation assets serving Alabama customers, supporting SO's ability to fulfill long-term electricity contracts and maintain revenue stability in the region.",

      "question": "How did NextEra Energy's operational exposure to Illinois transmission infrastructure in 2022 interact with the Clean Energy Law's rate-setting requirements and grid investment mandates, and how might this regulatory environment have contributed to the company's stock performance challenges by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NextEra Energy operated GridLiance infrastructure across Illinois and other Midwest states under FERC regulation, with assets in service dating back to 1960. This significant operational presence positioned NEE within the jurisdiction of Illinois regulatory frameworks. The Clean Energy Law, enacted in September 2021, imposed multiple requirements including a mandatory general rate case filing by January 20, 2023, accelerated amortization of excess deferred income taxes, and expanded grid investment mandates. These provisions directly affected utility operations and financial planning in Illinois. By 2024, NEE's stock performance showed decline, suggesting market concerns about how these regulatory changes might impact profitability, operational flexibility, and return on transmission investments in Illinois. The temporal chain reveals that NEE's physical infrastructure presence (2022) made it vulnerable to regulatory shifts (2022-2023), which then manifested in financial performance signals by 2024.",

On September 15, 2021, the Illinois Public Act 102-0662 was signed into law by the Governor of Illinois ('Clean Energy Law'). The Clean Energy Law includes, among other features, (1) procurement of CMCs from qualifying nuclear-powered generating facilities, (2) a requirement to file a general rate case or a new four-year multi-year plan no later than January 20, 2023 to establish rates effective after ComEd's existing performance-based distribution formula rate sunsets, (3)  an  extension  of  and  certain  adjustments  to  ComEd's  energy  efficiency  MWh  savings  goals,  (4)  revisions  to  the  Illinois  RPS requirements,  including  expanded  charges  for  the  procurement  of  RECs  from  wind  and  solar  generation,  (5)  a  requirement  to accelerate amortization of ComEd's unprotected excess deferred income taxes that ComEd was previously directed by the ICC to amortize using the average rate assumption method which equates to approximately 39.5 years, and (6) requirements that the ICC initiate  and  conduct  various  regulatory  proceedings  on  subjects  including  ethics,  spending,  grid  investments,  and  performance metrics. Regulatory or legal challenges regarding the validity or implementation of the Clean Energy Law are possible and Exelon and ComEd cannot reasonably predict the outcome of any such challenges.\n\n## Carbon Mitigation Credit\n\nThe  Clean  Energy  Law  establishes  decarbonization  requirements  for  Illinois  as  well  as  programs  to  support  the  retention  and development of emissions-free sources of electricity.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2022 financial stake in SEGCO position the company in relation to the 2024 evaluation of extending Plant Gaston's operations beyond 2028, and what does this imply for future power generation capacity commitments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company reported a $30 million financial stake in SEGCO, which owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs. By 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power\u2014both Southern Company subsidiaries\u2014were evaluating the extension of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the original retirement date of December 31, 2028, as documented in the 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) filing. This evaluation indicates that Southern Company's early stake in SEGCO positioned it to maintain a role in long-term power generation planning, particularly as it relates to leveraging existing assets for future capacity commitments. The 2024 filings show that Plant Gaston's potential extension was part of a broader strategy to maintain reliable generation capacity through 2034, aligning with Southern Company's strategic focus on optimizing long-lived assets.",

Effective May 1, 2024, as approved under the Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is $8 million for Plant V ogtle Unit 4. See Note 2 under \"G eorgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters\" for additional information.\n\n## 7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a V IE. If a venture is a V IE for which a Registrant is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.\n\nFor entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $128 million and $126 million, respectively, primarily related to investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings/losses from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Retirement of SEGCO's generating units is currently expected to occur by December 31, 2028. However, Alabama Power, in conjunction with Georgia Power, is evaluating extending the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the indicated retirement date. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2025 IRP\" for additional information. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and an ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $115 million in 2024, $112 million in 2023, and $124 million in 2022 for Alabama Power and $118 million in 2024, $115 million in 2023, and $127 million in 2022 for G eorgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $20 million in 2024, $25 million in 2023, and $14 million in 2022, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the V IEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb ex pected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nSP Solar is owned by Southern Power and a limited partner. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest, and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns a 66% ownership interest. The",

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE operated a 52.8% stake in South Texas pipelines, indicating a significant operational and financial involvement in the region. By December 2023, NEP completed the sale of its ownership interests in the South Texas pipeline portfolio, marking a strategic exit from this asset base. This change significantly reduced NEE\u2019s direct exposure to pipeline operations in South Texas. At the same time, NEE still maintained a financial stake in NEP, with receivables of $84 million and guarantees totaling $2.3 billion at the end of 2023, showing that while operational involvement decreased, financial linkages through guarantees and receivables remained substantial. This evolution reflects a strategic shift toward reducing asset ownership while maintaining financial ties through contractual obligations.",

        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 South Texas: NEE had a 52.8% ownership stake in South Texas pipelines in 2022, indicating active operation and investment in the region.",
        "Hop 2: South Texas \u2192 NEP: NEP owned and operated pipelines in South Texas, which were sold in December 2023, indicating a strategic exit from the region.",
        "Hop 3: NEP \u2190 NEE(2023): Despite the sale, NEE maintained financial exposure to NEP through $84 million in receivables and $2.3 billion in guarantees at the end of 2023."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's reliance on PowerSouth as an electricity supplier evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of capacity agreements and joint ownership stakes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (specifically Alabama Power) entered into an agreement to supply approximately 100 MWs of year-round capacity service to PowerSouth starting February 1, 2024. By 2023, this relationship deepened as Alabama Power and PowerSouth operated under a coordinated planning and operations agreement initiated in 2021, which included joint commitment, dispatch, and real-time energy transactions. Additionally, Alabama Power held an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Plant Miller Units 1 and 2 through PowerSouth, indicating a strategic shift toward greater integration and shared infrastructure.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Electricity: Southern Company (via Alabama Power) entered into an agreement to supply 100 MWs of capacity to PowerSouth starting in 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Electricity \u2192 PowerSouth: PowerSouth is described as a generating and transmitting cooperative that sells power to distributing cooperatives and municipal systems, with Alabama Power supplying it capacity and energy under coordinated operations.",
        "Hop 3: PowerSouth \u2190 SO(2023): Alabama Power has an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Plant Miller Units 1 and 2 through PowerSouth, showing a deepening of the relationship through shared infrastructure."

      "answer": "In 2023, SO's involvement in Glass Sands was reported as a standalone wind project with 118 MW of nameplate capacity located in Murray County, OK, and no explicit ownership structure was detailed beyond the implication of direct or partial ownership. By 2024, SO clarified that it owns 100% of Glass Sands through Southern Power, which is the controlling partner in multiple wind facilities, including SP Wind, which owns 100% of the other SP Wind facilities. This evolution from an ambiguous ownership structure to a clearly defined 100% ownership stake under Southern Power suggests a strategic consolidation of renewable assets, aligning with SO's broader approach to centralize control over its wind energy portfolio for more efficient management and capital deployment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO reported that the Tranquillity Solar Storage project, a battery energy storage system with 72 MW capacity in Fresno County, CA, had a COD (Commercial Operation Date) spanning November 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, indicating it was still under construction at the start of the year. By 2023, SO's filings showed that the project had been completed, with COD finalized between November 2021 and March 2022, and was now categorized under completed projects. This demonstrates that SO successfully transitioned the project from construction to full operation within the year, aligning with its broader focus on deploying battery energy storage systems, as evidenced by the parallel tracking of Garland Solar Storage. The consistent 72 MW capacity reported across both years confirms no reduction in project scope during execution.",

      "question": "How has Southern Company's increased reliance on nuclear generation from 2022 to 2024 impacted its exposure to cyber intrusion risks and associated risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's nuclear units represented 26% and 28% of total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. By 2024, this share had increased to 25% for Alabama Power and 34% for Georgia Power, indicating a growing dependence on nuclear generation. Since nuclear facilities are explicitly noted to be subject to cyber intrusion risks that could result in operational fines or shutdowns, the increased share of nuclear generation heightens Southern Company's exposure to these risks. In response, the 2024 filing emphasizes compliance with mandatory cybersecurity standards and highlights the potential for increased licensing or compliance costs due to cyber threats. This suggests that Southern Company has likely elevated its cybersecurity investment and risk mitigation strategies to address the growing interplay between nuclear operations and cyber intrusion risks.",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

Achievement of these goals is dependent on various factors, many of which the Southern Company system does not control, including load growth across the Southern Company system's service territory, energy policy and regulations, natural gas prices, and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to economically transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet through a diverse portfolio of resources including low-carbon and carbon-free resources; making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing to implement effective energy efficiency and demand response programs; customer demand for carbon-free energy; implementing initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution emissions; continuing research and development with a focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future. There is no guarantee that the Southern Company system will achieve these goals.\n\nSee MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters - Environmental Laws and Regulations -Greenhouse Gases\" in Item 7 herein for additional information.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions.

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's 2022 operations in North Carolina influence the development of HB 951's carbon reduction targets, and how did those regulatory requirements shape Duke Energy's 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan, particularly in terms of coal retirement timelines and carbon neutrality goals?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy operated extensively in North Carolina and had previously submitted an IRP in 2020 that proposed accelerated coal retirements aligned with its 2030 CO\u2082 emissions goal. However, in December 2021, the PSCSC rejected this accelerated scenario, opting instead for a base case without a CO\u2082 price. In response to this regulatory uncertainty and the passage of HB 951 in 2021\u2014which mandated a 70% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050\u2014Duke Energy adjusted its planning process. By 2023, this led to the filing of the Carolinas Resource Plan, which proposed Portfolio 3 as the most prudent path forward, aiming to exit coal by 2035 while extending nuclear plant operations and enhancing energy efficiency programs. This demonstrates a clear evolution from Duke's initial aggressive coal retirement plans in 2022 to a more measured, regulatory-compliant approach in 2023 under HB 951\u2019s framework.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's 2022 investment in distributed energy solutions was part of its broader strategy to expand into emerging energy technologies and services. PowerSecure, which Southern Company has a stake in since its 2016 acquisition, is the key developer of distributed energy and resilience solutions for Southern Company's commercial, industrial, and utility customers. However, despite this strategic alignment, PowerSecure experienced a decline in fair value in 2022 due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that reduced sales growth and projected cash flows. This led to a $119 million goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, indicating that the earlier investment in distributed energy solutions did not yield the expected financial returns in the short term. The temporal evolution of this chain shows that while Southern Company continued to support the distributed energy segment through PowerSecure, external economic pressures undermined the value of that investment within a year.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n## Business Activities\n\nSouthern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n- The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.\n- Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.\n- Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments - gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets - and one nonreportable segment, all other. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments also included wholesale gas services. See Notes 7, 15, and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nSouthern Company's other business activities include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications and gas storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.\n\nSee FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for a discussion of the many factors that could impact the Registrants' future results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n## Southern Company\n\nOn October 29, 2021, Southern Company completed the sale of assets subject to a domestic leveraged lease to the lessee for $45 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. On December 13, 2021, Southern Company completed the termination of its leasehold interest in assets associated with its two international leveraged lease projects and received cash proceeds of approximately $673 million after the accelerated exercise of the lessee's purchase options. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $93 million ($99 million gain after tax). See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company\" for additional information.\n\n## Alabama Power\n\nOn September 23, 2021, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Calhoun Power Company, LLC, which owns and operates a 743-MW winter peak, simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun County, Alabama (Calhoun Generating Station). The completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction and waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC. On October 28, 2021, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC to procure additional generating capacity through this acquisition. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.",

      "question": "How did the increased risk of physical attacks on nuclear power plants in 2023 impact Duke Energy's insurance costs and coverage limitations compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy noted that poor investment performance and market fluctuations could negatively impact the funding of nuclear decommissioning trusts, which were already subject to significant market risk. By 2023, the company highlighted that threats of physical or cyberattacks, along with natural disasters and financial instability of insurers, had led to a reduction in the availability of insurance, with higher premiums, increased deductibles, and more restrictive policy terms. Additionally, the 2023 filings specifically noted that insurance may not cover all potential exposures or actual losses incurred, indicating a worsening risk profile tied directly to the increased threat environment around nuclear facilities. This shows a clear evolution from market risk exposure in 2022 to operational and security risk-driven insurance constraints in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding.\n\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.\n\n## Poor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.\n\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants' proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## Duke Energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\n\nBecause Duke Energy is a holding company with no operations or cash flows of its own, its ability to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock, is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Duke Energy, its subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Duke Energy with funds. In addition, Duke Energy may provide capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on Duke Energy's common stock.\n\n## GENERAL RISKS\n\n## The failure of Duke Energy information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses.\n\nDuke Energy's operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers' systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nIn addition to maintaining our current information technology systems, Duke Energy believes the digital transformation of its business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers. Duke Energy's information technology systems are critical to costeffective, reliable daily operations and our ability to effectively serve our customers. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions and we must enhance or replace our information technology systems in response. This involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand. If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could materially adversely affect our business strategy as well as impact the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\n## Potential terrorist activities, or military or other actions, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses.\n\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. Information technology systems, transportation systems for our fuel sources including natural gas pipelines, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups that could have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC's design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

By 2024, this allocation remained at $700 million under a new arrangement expiring in 2029, with the additional note that Nicor Gas was also the borrower under a separate $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. This indicates that Southern Company maintained a consistent base allocation for Nicor Gas' working capital needs while adding a smaller, shorter-term facility, potentially to provide more flexible liquidity management. The extension of the primary arrangement\u2019s maturity from 2026 to 2029 also reflects a strategic shift toward longer-term financial stability for Nicor Gas.",

      "question": "How did the shift in NEE's pension plan asset allocation from 2022 to 2024 affect its use of pooled separate accounts as part of its broader investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan targeted a 45% allocation to equity investments and included pooled separate accounts as a key commingled investment vehicle to achieve diversification and risk mitigation. By 2024, the equity allocation was reduced to 43%, while alternative investments increased from 13% to 20%, indicating a strategic shift toward higher-risk, higher-return assets. This reallocation suggests that NEE likely adjusted its use of pooled separate accounts to align with the new target mix, reducing emphasis on traditional equities and increasing exposure to alternative strategies, which may also be accessed through pooled vehicles. The continued inclusion of pooled separate accounts in both years shows their ongoing role in the pension plan\u2019s diversified investment approach.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a noncontrolling interest in NEP, which already owned a portfolio that included solar plus battery storage projects. By 2024, NEE's capital expenditure plans reflected a significant increase in battery storage investments, with approximately 4,265 MW of battery storage projects included in its capital expenditure estimates. This indicates that NEE's earlier stake in NEP helped catalyze the expansion of battery storage initiatives, which became a more prominent part of NEE\u2019s broader capital strategy by 2024.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

These obligations primarily related to guaranteeing the residual value of certain financing leases and obligations under purchased power agreements.

A pproximately $3.2 billion of related commitments are included in the estimated capital expenditures table in Commitments above. In addition, NEER has contracts primarily for the transportation and storage of natural gas with expiration dates through 2041.",

      "question": "How did the change in NEE's pension plan allocation to convertible securities from 2022 (10%) to 2024 (5%) reflect a strategic shift in risk management and asset diversification within the broader investment policy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan allocated 10% of its target asset allocation to convertible securities, indicating a relatively higher emphasis on this asset class as part of its diversified investment strategy aimed at achieving high returns with prudent risk. By 2024, this allocation was reduced to 5%, signaling a strategic de-emphasis on convertible securities. This shift likely reflects a recalibration of risk exposure, as NEE increased its allocation to alternative investments from 13% to 20%, suggesting a broader pivot toward alternative assets perceived as more stable or complementary to traditional equities and fixed income. The pension plan continues to hold convertible securities directly and through a limited partnership, but the reduced percentage indicates a more conservative posture in this segment, aligning with the overall goal of protecting the plan\u2019s funded status and minimizing future employer contributions.",

This disclosure laid the foundation for understanding the company's approach to fair value estimation. By 2024, the company applied these valuation principles to specific assets like the $139 million Chevron lease receivable, which was subject to a security interest. The 2024 disclosures show that fair value estimation continued to rely on present value techniques and market interpretations, particularly relevant for assets like the Chevron lease that could be affected by bankruptcy events or credit rating downgrades. The evolution from general valuation methods in 2023 to specific asset applications in 2024 demonstrates a consistent yet more detailed approach to fair value estimation.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Assets Subject to Lien\n\nMississippi Power provides retail service to its largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at its refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through at least 2038 in accordance with agreements approved by the Mississippi PSC. The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets located at the refinery and owned by Mississippi Power, with a lease receivable balance of $139 million at December 31, 2024, that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies. See Note 9 under \"Lessor\" for additional information.\n\nSee Note 8 under \"Long-term Debt\" for information regarding debt secured by certain assets of Georgia Power and Southern Company Gas.\n\n## 6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted riskfree rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory assets.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally surface impoundments. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle). See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein for additional information. Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.\n\nSouthern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's approach to environmental compliance cost recovery from industrial customers evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about their risk mitigation strategy given the 96% investment coverage ratio through 2029 in long-term PPAs?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company expressed concern that environmental compliance costs recovered through regulated rates could lead to reduced demand from industrial customers due to higher prices. By 2024, the company demonstrated a shift in strategy, evidenced by a 96% investment coverage ratio through 2029 via long-term PPAs with industrial and commercial counterparties, 92% of which were with investment-grade rated entities. This indicates a strategic pivot toward securing stable revenue streams through contractual commitments, reducing exposure to demand volatility from environmental cost pass-throughs. The evolution from general regulatory cost recovery mechanisms to structured long-term agreements shows a proactive risk mitigation approach, aligning environmental compliance spending with contracted revenue visibility.",

In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 46% were with BBB+ to BBBor equivalent rated counterparties, and 6% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fix ed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 78,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. G as distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. SNG is developing a proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, which the operator of the joint venture anticipates will be completed by 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

      "question": "How did Duke Energy Carolinas' use of Storm Recovery Bonds evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of the storm costs being financed and the geographic scope of the associated DECNC SF entity?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas used Storm Recovery Bonds through the DECNC SF entity to finance unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019 in North Carolina. By 2024, the company expanded its storm recovery financing to include South Carolina through the newly formed DECSC SF entity, which financed storm costs incurred from 2014 through 2022. The DECNC SF entity remained consolidated under Duke Energy Carolinas, indicating continued reliance on this structure for storm cost recovery, while the addition of the South Carolina-focused entity in 2024 shows a geographic and temporal expansion of the company's storm recovery financing strategy.",

However, in February 2023, KO Transmission sold all of its pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC for approximately book value. This divestiture significantly reduced Duke Energy Ohio's direct exposure to FERC-regulated pipeline operations, shifting its risk profile away from the operational and compliance burdens previously associated with KO Transmission\u2019s 90-mile pipeline and its interconnections. As of 2023, while Duke Energy Registrants remained subject to FERC-enforced cybersecurity and infrastructure protection standards, the removal of KO Transmission\u2019s active pipeline assets from Duke\u2019s portfolio reduced the scope of FERC-specific regulatory obligations tied to interstate gas transportation.",

      "question": "How has the increased contribution of nuclear generation at Alabama Power and Georgia Power from 2022 to 2023 influenced Southern Company's exposure to health risks associated with nuclear operations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power and Georgia Power derived 26% and 28% of their total KWHs from nuclear units, respectively, while in 2023 this increased to 27% and 29%. Despite this increase in nuclear generation, the health risks associated with nuclear operations\u2014such as potential harmful effects from radioactive material releases\u2014remained a consistent exposure for Southern Company. The company continued to face inherent health and safety risks tied to nuclear facilities, indicating that the increased reliance on nuclear generation did not reduce the company's overall exposure to these risks. This suggests a growing operational dependency on nuclear energy alongside sustained health risk exposure, with potential financial implications from both increased capital expenditures for safety and the inherent risks of nuclear operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

By 2023, the scope expanded to include additional focus on GHG emissions attest services and sustainability bond expenditures, reflecting new regulatory and environmental reporting requirements.

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, Southern Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nSouthern Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.",

In 2023, this classification remained consistent, but the company emphasized that substantially all AFS securities qualified for regulatory accounting, resulting in the deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses as regulatory assets or liabilities.

      "question": "How did the $96 million pre-tax charge from regulatory disallowances at Nicor Gas in 2023 influence Southern Company\u2019s 2024 accounting treatment of property, plant, and equipment, particularly regarding the recognition of regulatory disallowances in asset valuation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company recorded a $96 million pre-tax charge at Nicor Gas due to regulatory disallowances of certain capital investments, signaling early regulatory pushback on asset cost recovery (Hop 1). This context is directly tied to the 2023 financial statement note that explicitly links lower revenues to these disallowances at Nicor Gas (Hop 2). By 2024, Southern Company updated its accounting policy for property, plant, and equipment, explicitly stating that asset values would be reduced by 'regulatory disallowances and impairments'\u2014a direct reflection of the earlier year\u2019s experience (Hop 3). This indicates that the 2023 disallowance event contributed to a formalized and more transparent asset valuation methodology in 2024, where regulatory risk was explicitly accounted for in asset carrying values.",

This reduction in outstanding debt and the reallocation of credit capacity under the 2029 $700 million credit arrangement restricted for Nicor Gas\u2019s working capital needs suggests a strategic shift toward longer-term financing and reduced exposure to fluctuating short-term rates.

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "In 2022, SO had under construction the Garland Solar Storage project, which had a nameplate capacity of 88 MW and reached commercial operation in phases from September 2021 through February 2022. This project became part of SO's battery energy storage portfolio, contributing directly to their production capacity. By 2023, SO's battery energy storage production included the completed Garland Solar Storage facility, indicating that the project completed in 2022 became a significant contributor to SO's renewable energy infrastructure in the following year. This demonstrates a direct temporal and operational progression in SO's renewable energy development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Garland Solar Storage: SO had Garland Solar Storage under construction with 88 MW capacity in 2022",

By January 31, 2024, Duke Energy announced the full redemption of all 20,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and their corresponding 20,000,000 Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Series A Preferred Stock, with a redemption price of $25,000 per preferred share ($25.00 per Depositary Share). In 2024 filings, while the Certificate of Designations for Series A Preferred Stock remained referenced, the redemption event marked a significant shift in how these instruments were treated, effectively discontinuing their presence in the company's capital structure. This evolution reflects a strategic move to retire this class of preferred equity.",

      "question": "How did the increase in nuclear power generation contribution from 2022 to 2023 affect Southern Company's exposure to nuclear safety risks, particularly in light of NRC-imposed compliance costs?",
      "answer": "In 2022, nuclear units represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. By 2023, this increased to 27% and 29%, indicating a growing reliance on nuclear power. This increase in nuclear generation likely heightened Southern Company's exposure to nuclear safety risks, as outlined in both years' filings, which detail risks such as environmental releases, decommissioning uncertainties, and NRC compliance costs. In 2023, the filing specifically noted that NRC orders or future safety requirements could impose substantial operating and capital expenditures on Alabama Power and Georgia Power, suggesting that the increased nuclear generation share amplified the company's financial exposure to these regulatory risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Nuclear Power Plants: SO operated nuclear plants through its subsidiaries, contributing 26% (Alabama Power) and 28% (Georgia Power) of total KWHs generated.",
        "Hop 2: Nuclear Power Plants \u2192 Safety Risks: Nuclear facilities are subject to inherent risks including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, and financial risks, such as NRC compliance costs and potential shutdowns.",
        "Hop 3: Safety Risks \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, SO's nuclear generation increased to 27% (Alabama Power) and 29% (Georgia Power), and the filing explicitly noted that NRC compliance could require substantial operating and capital expenditures."

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy identified reputational risk as a material concern tied to climate change, particularly highlighting how increased legal and regulatory scrutiny could damage its public standing. This concern materialized in 2024 when the company faced concrete financial exposure due to the EPA\u2019s April 2024 GHG emission reduction standards, which imposed stricter compliance costs and operational constraints. These regulations, combined with Duke Energy\u2019s reliance on nuclear production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), created a dual exposure: failure to extend reactor licenses could jeopardize its 2050 net-zero target, while potential elimination of tax credits would increase the cost burden of transitioning to cleaner energy sources. Thus, the reputational risk identified in 2023 evolved into a tangible financial challenge in 2024, directly impacting its regulatory compliance strategy and cost recovery expectations.",

D uke E nergy is working to m eet growing and evolving custom er energy needs while balancing custom er reliability and affordability, and other priorities including the need to m odernize its fleet and the regulatory construct. D uke E nergy is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, econom ic and com petitive uncertainties and contingencies, m any of which are beyond its control and may m ake those goals difficult to achieve.\n\nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable D uke E nergy to reduce its carbon em issions. F or exam ple, D uke E nergy anticipates that its nuclear stations in N orth C arolina and South C arolina will continue to qualify for significant tax incentives in the form  of nuclear production tax credits under the IR A. N uclear energy is a reliable and clean energy source and nuclear tax incentives allowed under the IR A, including nuclear production tax credits, are expected to reduce the cost of the energy transition for our custom ers. If such nuclear production tax credits were elim inated or reduced, it could negatively im pact our ability to return the anticipated cost benefits to custom ers.\n\nAdditionally, new E P A rules issued in April 2024 im pose stringent G H G  em ission reduction standards, revised air toxic lim its, and wastewater discharge lim itations that m ay im pact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational tim eline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies m ay be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transm ission and distribution upgrades needed to accom m odate the build out of large volum es of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the C om pany to continue to retire existing carbon em itting assets or m ake investm ents in new generating capacity. T he C om pany m ay be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on tim e. In addition, new technologies that are not yet com m ercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, D uke E nergy's ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\n\nMeeting the evolving and growing energy needs of our custom ers will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, m ay challenge our ability to m eet custom er expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environm ent, particularly as dem and increases. O ur nuclear fleet is central to our ability to m eet these objectives and custom er expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond m idcentury. F ailure to receive approval from  the N R C  for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\n\nAs a consequence, D uke E nergy m ay not be able to fully im plem ent or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which m ay have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\n\n## REGULATORY, LE GISLATIVE  AND LE GAL R ISK S\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of N orth C arolina, South C arolina, F lorida, O hio, T ennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility com m issions, retail electric and natural gas rates m ay be subject to review and possible reduction by the com m issions, which m ay decrease the D uke E nergy R egistrants' earnings. Additionally, if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a tim ely basis, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be negatively im pacted. D ifferences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as N orth C arolina and South C arolina in D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' service territory, m ay also result in failure to recover costs.\n\nI f legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the D uke E nergy R egistrants' exclusive rights to serve their regulated custom ers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively im pacted. F ederal and state regulations, laws, com m ercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to prom ote and expand the use of E E measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in D uke E nergy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in D uke E nergy service territories or result in custom ers leaving the electric distribution system  and an increase in custom er net energy m etering, which allows custom ers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit am ount. O ver tim e, custom er adoption of these technologies could result in D uke E nergy not being able to fully recover the costs and investm ent in generation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company conducted a quantitative assessment for PowerSecure, which revealed that its fair value was lower than its carrying amount, primarily due to declining macroeconomic conditions. This led to a goodwill impairment of $119 million. In contrast, during 2023, PowerSecure's management again performed a quantitative assessment, which showed that its fair value exceeded its carrying amount, avoiding any impairment. This reversal indicates that the financial health of PowerSecure improved over the year, reducing the need for further impairment charges.",

The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur, including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.\n\nAs part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value.\n\nGoodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2023 IRP Update\" for additional information.\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034.\n\nThe 2025 IRP requests approval to pursue installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n\nAdditionally, the 2025 IRP requests upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033. Also, the 2025 IRP requests upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n\nThe 2025 IRP requests approval of investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n\nThe 2025 IRP also includes requests for RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n\nA decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2025 IRP is expected in July 2025. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2025 IRP\" for additional information.\n\n## Mississippi Power\n\nOn April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC did not note any deficiencies within the prescribed 120-day review period; therefore, the filing is concluded. The 2024 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs based on 50% ownership), all by the end of 2028, which is consistent with the completion of Mississippi Power's affiliate PPA with Georgia Power. On January 9, 2025, Mississippi Power notified the Mississippi PSC of its intent to extend the retirement date of Plant Daniel Unit 2 and potentially ex tend the retirement dates of other fossil steam units beyond their current 2028 retirement dates in order to serve recently signed economic development loads of approximately 600 MWs.\n\nOn November 8, 2024, Mississippi Power entered into an agreement with FP&amp;L to acquire FP&amp;L's 50% ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2. This acquisition will include a payment by FP&amp;L to Mississippi Power of between $35 million and $38 million, which represents an estimate of the incremental cost to Mississippi Power to assume ownership of FP&amp;L's interest, based on the timing of the completion of the transaction. On January 7, 2025, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's request for (i) the inclusion of the acquired assets and the associated costs at Plant Daniel in Mississippi Power's retail rate base, upon completion of the transaction, (ii) the establishment of a new regulatory liability account in which all of the proceeds to be paid by FP&amp;L will be recorded, and (iii) Mississippi Power's ability to amortize that regulatory liability by charging certain ex penditures against it. The completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, approval by the Florida PSC.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, Mississippi Power submitted its annual ECO Plan filing to the Mississippi PSC, which requested a $6 million annual increase in revenues.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting Mississippi Power's request for an $8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the MRA tariff, effective May 29, 2024, subject to refund. On December 23, 2024, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy filed a settlement agreement with the FERC. The settlement agreement provides for (i) a $1 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues and a refund to customers of approximately $4 million, (ii) a rate escalation of 2.5% on an annual basis in periods subsequent to December 31, 2024 and continuing through the end of the Shared Services Agreement (SSA) on December 31, 2035, and (iii) a waiver of rights by Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy to file for any changes in non-fuel rates through the end of the term of the SSA. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the FERC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE reported a fair value of $191 million in assets and $31 million in liabilities for forward contracts - gas, using the discounted cash flow valuation technique with a weighted-average forward price of $3 per MMBtu. By 2024, the fair value of forward contracts - gas increased to $296 million in assets and $46 million in liabilities, still using the discounted cash flow technique but with a higher weighted-average forward price of $4 per MMBtu. This indicates NEE's growing exposure to gas price volatility and a strategic increase in forward contracting, supported by consistent use of discounted cash flow valuation with evolving pricing assumptions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Indiana contributed $6 million to the company's net periodic post-retirement benefit costs, indicating a notable operational presence in the state. By 2023, this operational footprint was mirrored in the capital structure, with Duke Energy Indiana holding $285 million in tax-exempt bonds\u2014part of a broader $1.331 billion total tax-exempt bond portfolio disclosed across the company. This suggests a strategic alignment where Indiana operations, which were financially material in 2022, became a key component of Duke Energy's tax-advantaged financing structure in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Indiana: Duke Energy Indiana reported $6 million in net periodic post-retirement benefit costs in 2022, indicating a significant operational presence in the state.",
        "Hop 2: Indiana \u2192 Tax-exempt bonds: By 2023, Duke Energy Indiana disclosed $285 million in tax-exempt bonds, showing a direct financial link between the state operations and this specific debt instrument.",
        "Hop 3: Tax-exempt bonds \u2190 DUK(2023): The 2023 disclosures showed Duke Energy's total tax-exempt bonds at $1.331 billion, with Indiana accounting for a substantial portion at $285 million."

      "answer": "Southern Company maintained the same regulatory compliance strategy across both years, with Mississippi Power Company continuing to meet the conditions for reduced disclosure filings under General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K in both 2022 and 2024. This consistency implies a deliberate strategic approach to managing regulatory compliance costs, leveraging streamlined reporting to reduce administrative burden while balancing the potential trade-off of lower investor transparency due to less detailed disclosure. The repeated use of the reduced disclosure format suggests that the company finds value in this regulatory mechanism across multiple reporting cycles.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of Southern Company's reliance on Commercial Paper Programs from 2022 to 2024 impact Nicor Gas' access to working capital, particularly in light of changes to credit arrangements and liquidity support allocations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Nicor Gas, relied on Commercial Paper Programs for short-term financing, with Nicor Gas maintaining its own commercial paper program to support working capital needs due to regulatory restrictions preventing it from making money pool loans to affiliates. By 2024, Nicor Gas remained a borrower under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025 and also benefited from a $700 million allocation under Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029, specifically restricted for its working capital needs. Additionally, at year-end 2024, liquidity support from unused credit was allocated to commercial paper programs and revenue bonds, including $1.7 billion in variable rate demand revenue bonds with liquidity support. This indicates that while Nicor Gas continued to depend on commercial paper, its access to structured credit arrangements increased, enhancing its financial flexibility compared to 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Commercial Paper Programs: Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Nicor Gas, relied on commercial paper programs for short-term financing, with Nicor Gas restricted from making money pool loans to affiliates.",

Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. Southern Company does not expect to issue any equity in the capital markets through 2026 but may issue equity through its stock plans during this time. See Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Equity Units\" for information on stock purchase contracts associated with Southern Company's equity units.\n\nThe Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as discussed further herein).\n\nThe amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2022, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See \"Cash Requirements\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2021, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for the Deuel Harvest wind facility, the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, and existing tax equity partnerships totaling $299 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under \"General\" and \"Southern Power,\" respectively, for additional information.\n\nThe issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.\n\nThe Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Bank Credit Arrangements\" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial paper program.\n\nSouthern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.\n\nBy regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2021, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.3 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.",

Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and at Nicor Gas.

All of Southern Company Gas' other subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program. See \"Structural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nIn addition, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various bank term loan agreements.

S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "answer": "Southern Company's investment in SNG declined from $1,243 million in 2022 to $1,202 million in 2023, indicating a cautious approach to capital deployment in this joint venture. This reduction coincided with SNG's development of a $3 billion pipeline project requiring FERC approval, which introduced regulatory uncertainty and long-term financial exposure, as the project is not expected to be completed until 2029. In response, Southern Company adjusted its capital strategy in 2024, aiming to increase its equity ratio to approximately 55% by the end of 2025 (up from 53.9% in 2024 and 52.3% in 2023), signaling a strategic de-leveraging effort to strengthen financial flexibility in light of uncertain regulatory outcomes and long-term infrastructure commitments.",

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power.\n\n## Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity\n\nOn October 24, 2024, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. for a total purchase price of approximately $622 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. owns and operates the Lindsay Hill Generating Station, an approximately 855-MW combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Alabama Power will assume an existing power sales agreement under which the full output of the generating facility remains committed to a third party through April 2027. Upon expiration of the power sales agreement, Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with the Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC, as well as the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Renewable Generation Certificate\n\nThrough the issuance of a Renewable Generation Certificate (RGC), Alabama Power is authorized by the Alabama PSC to procure renewable capacity and energy and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. Under the original RGC, Alabama was authorized to procure up to 500 MWs of renewable capacity and energy. In June 2023, the Alabama PSC issued an order approving modifications to Alabama Power's RGC. The modifications authorized Alabama Power to procure an additional 2,400 MWs of renewable capacity and energy by June 14, 2029 and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. The modifications also increased the size of allowable renewable projects from 80 MWs to 200 MWs and increased the annual approval limit from 160 MWs to 400 MWs. Through December 31, 2024, Alabama Power has procured solar capacity totaling approximately 498 MWs under the RGC.\n\n## Rate RSE\n\nThe Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an \"A\" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey.\n\nAlabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 53.9% and 52.3%, respectively.",

By 2023, the company disclosed the pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, indicating a shift or expansion in how these derivatives were accounted for.

See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.\n\nEnergy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:\n\n- Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.\n- Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.\n- Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.\n\nSome energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.",

By 2024, PowerSecure was described as central to Southern Company\u2019s development of distributed energy and resilience solutions, including the deployment of microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.

See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under \"Southern Company Gas\" and \"Southern Company Leveraged Lease,\" respectively, and Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" for information regarding impairment charges recorded during the periods presented.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities\n\nSouthern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas each evaluated its goodwill in the fourth quarter 2021 and determined no impairment was required. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" for information regarding impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in 2019.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, goodwill was as follows:\n\n",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "answer": "In 2023, SO completed the Tranquillity Solar Storage project with 72 MW of battery energy storage capacity in Fresno County, CA, indicating active investment in integrated solar-storage solutions. However, by 2024, SO's project pipeline shifted toward pure solar generation with no storage components, exemplified by the Millers Branch project comprising 200 MW (Phase I), 180 MW (Phase II), and 132 MW (Phase III) solar facilities in Haskell County, TX. This suggests a strategic realignment away from combined solar-storage infrastructure toward dedicated solar generation, potentially reflecting market demand shifts or internal capital prioritization changes.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's operational footprint in Alabama in 2022 relate to its investment in SNG in 2023, and what does this imply about its strategy in natural gas infrastructure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company operated in Alabama through its traditional electric operating company, Alabama Power, which was part of a vertically integrated utility structure. By 2023, Southern Company, through its subsidiary Southern Company Gas, maintained a 50% interest in SNG, a major natural gas pipeline connecting supply basins in Alabama and neighboring states to broader Southeastern markets. This continuity suggests a strategic emphasis on leveraging Alabama's geographic importance in natural gas transportation and distribution, aligning with its broader energy infrastructure goals. The 7,000-mile SNG pipeline underscores Southern Company's commitment to maintaining diversified natural gas supply routes and enhancing its regional energy services portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company, through SCS acting as agent for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Power, had long-term interstate natural gas transportation agreements with SNG governed by FERC-regulated tariffs. These agreements incurred transportation costs that were part of the contractual obligations between the entities. By 2024, Southern Company Gas had an equity method investment in SNG, generating $146 million in earnings for that year. This represents a shift from a purely contractual supplier relationship in 2023 to a more integrated financial stake in 2024, suggesting a strategic deepening of Southern Company's involvement with SNG's operations.",

By 2024, PowerSecure\u2014owned by Southern Company\u2014was actively deploying microgrids, and this led to a $120 million increase in operating revenues and an $82 million rise in cost of sales related to distributed infrastructure projects.

      "answer": "In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain from the sale of Sequent, which temporarily boosted liquidity and may have enabled a more aggressive financing posture. By 2023, Nicor Gas had increased its short-term bank debt to $392 million, up from $300 million in 2021, signaling a shift toward greater reliance on short-term financing for its gas distribution operations. This increase in short-term debt coincided with Southern Company\u2019s broader financing strategy, as evidenced by the company\u2019s overall short-term bank debt rising from $300 million in 2021 to $520 million in 2023.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

      "question": "How did HB 951's carbon reduction requirements influence Duke Energy's 2024 generation planning in North Carolina, particularly regarding Portfolio 3 and new resource needs?",
      "answer": "HB 951, enacted in 2021 and referenced in Duke Energy\u2019s 2023 filings, mandated a 70% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 for Duke Energy\u2019s North Carolina operations. In response, Duke filed its 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan (Portfolio 3), recommending the most cost-effective and reliable path to compliance. By 2024, increased economic development led to a significantly revised load forecast, prompting Duke to file supplemental modeling and analysis in January 2024. This led to a settlement in July 2024 with stakeholders, confirming Portfolio 3 as the planning baseline and outlining near-term procurement for solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and natural gas, as well as exploratory work on advanced nuclear and offshore wind. The NCUC approved the settlement in November 2024, emphasizing reliability and affordability while addressing updated resource needs. Thus, HB 951 directly shaped Duke\u2019s 2024 planning by anchoring its long-term strategy and influencing adjustments due to evolving demand.",

        "Hop 2: HB 951 \u2192 North Carolina: North Carolina passed HB 951, which directed the NCUC to approve Duke\u2019s carbon plan and oversee its implementation, including biennial updates and integrated resource planning.",

          "chunk_text": "The Duke E nergy R egistrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of C O  em issions over tim e. Between 2005 and 2024, the D uke E nergy R egistrants have collectively lowered the C O  em issions from  their electricity generation by 44%. T im elines and initiatives, as well as im plem entation of new technologies, for future G H G  em ission reductions will vary in each state in which the C om pany operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, custom ers and other stakeholders. D uke E nergy's goals and actions taken to reduce CO emissions potentially lower the exposure to any future m andatory C O  em ission reduction requirem ents, whether as a result of federal legislation, E P A regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown em ission reduction requirem ents. 2 2 2 2\n\nActions to reduce C O  em issions have included the retirem ent of 58 coal-fired electric generating units with a com bined generating capacity of over 8,000 M W , while investing in renewables and energy storage and state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer C O  em issions per unit of electricity generated than coal. Duke E nergy also has m ade investm ents to increase E E  offerings and ensure continued operations of its zero-C O  em issions hydropower and nuclear plants. T hese efforts have diversified our electric generating system  and significantly reduced C O  em issions. 2 2 2 2\n\nDuke E nergy will continue to explore the use of currently available and com m ercially dem onstrated technology, as well as developing technologies, to m eet custom er dem and reliably and affordably while reducing C O  em issions to achieve its net-zero goal as well as to com ply with any future regulations. T hese technologies include E E , wind, solar and storage, as well as evolving technologies like carbon capture, utilization and storage, the use of hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels, long-duration energy storage and advanced nuclear. D uke Energy plans to adjust to and incorporate these evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability of energy while m eeting regulatory requirem ents and custom er dem ands. U nder any future scenario involving m andatory C O  lim itations, the D uke E nergy R egistrants would plan to seek recovery of their com pliance costs through appropriate regulatory m echanism s. Future levels of C O  em issions by the D uke E nergy R egistrants will be influenced by variables that include custom er growth and capacity needs in the jurisdictions in which they operate, public policy, tax incentives, econom ic conditions that affect electricity dem and, weather conditions, fuel prices, m arket prices, availability of resources and labor, com pliance with new or existing regulations, the ability to m ake enhancem ents to transm ission and distribution system s to support increased deploym ent of renewables and behind-the-m eter technologies and the existence of new technologies that can be deployed to generate the electricity necessary to m eet custom er dem and. 2 2 2\n\nCurrently, the D uke E nergy R egistrants do not purchase carbon credits or offsets for use in connection with the C om pany's net-zero C O  em issions goals. T hough they m ay purchase carbon credits or offsets for such uses in the future, the am ount or cost of which is not expected to be m aterial at this tim e. 2\n\n## Generation Portfolio Planning Process\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IR P s. T hese detailed, highly technical plans are based on the C om pany's thorough analysis of num erous factors that can im pact the dem and for electricity as well as the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term  generation resource planning decisions. The IR P  process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account stakeholder input as well as forecasts of future electricity dem and, fuel prices, transm ission im provem ents, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, E E  and dem and response initiatives. T he IR P  process also helps evaluate potential environm ental and regulatory scenarios to better m itigate policy and econom ic risks. T he IR P s we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nI n 2021, the state of N orth C arolina passed H B 951, which am ong other things, directed the N C U C  to develop and approve a carbon reduction plan that would target a 70% reduction in C O  em issions from  D uke E nergy P rogress' and D uke E nergy C arolinas' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology. In D ecem ber 2022, the N C U C  issued an order adopting the first C arbon P lan as directed by H B 951 with the C arbon P lan to be updated every two years thereafter. 2\n\nI n August 2023, D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress filed their 2023 system wide C arolinas R esource P lan (the P lan) with the N C U C  and P SC SC . T he P lan provided a range of generation options, including three core portfolios, reflecting an 'all of the above' approach to powering the energy needs of our growing region. In the P lan, D uke E nergy Carolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress recom m ended one of the three core portfolios presented, P ortfolio 3, as the m ost prudent path forward to com ply with applicable state laws, providing a reliable and orderly energy transition that was proposed as the m ost reasonable and lowest-cost plan for the C arolinas. In N ovem ber 2023, D uke E nergy C arolinas and Duke E nergy P rogress provided notice to the N C U C  and P SC SC  of a substantially increased load forecast resulting from  increased econom ic developm ent in the C arolinas occurring since the P lan was prepared. The com panies filed supplem ental m odeling and analysis with the N C U C  and P SC SC  in January 2024, dem onstrating the need for additional resources beyond the initial set of resources identified by the com panies in their initial plan.\n\nI n J uly 2024, D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress reached a broad settlem ent in the N C U C  proceeding with the P ublic Staff, W alm art, and the C arolinas C lean E nergy Business Association on the P lan, agreeing it is reasonable to use P ortfolio 3 as the reference portfolio for planning purposes. Am ong other things, the settlem ent confirm s a set of near-term  activities, including developm ent and procurem ent activities for solar, battery storage, onshore wind, and certain natural gas generation assets, as well as certain lim ited actions exploring initial developm ent activities related to advanced nuclear, offshore wind, and to advance the potential for 1,834 M W  of pum ped storage hydro at the Bad C reek II facility by 2034. T he N C U C  conducted evidentiary hearings in July and August 2024 and issued an order accepting the settlem ent and providing further direction in N ovem ber 2024. The order continues to em phasize the critical im portance of reliability and m aintaining affordability, while taking balanced actions to m eet forecasted load growth. Additionally, the NCUC directed the C om pany to continue to pursue the m erger of D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress. As a condition of the N C U C  approval of the D uke E nergy and Progress E nergy m erger in 2012, the N C U C  instructed the C om pany to consider a m erger between D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress. Since that tim e, the C om pany has analyzed, and continues to analyze, the possibility of such a com bination, and the C om pany anticipates beginning m erger-related filings with the N C U C , P SC SC  and F E R C  in the second half of 2025. The C om pany is currently targeting a com pletion date for the m erger of January 1, 2027. T here is no assurance that the C om pany will be able to obtain the approval of the N C U C  or P SC SC , or other required regulatory approvals, for the potential m erger.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the change in accounting treatment for energy-related derivatives, specifically those designated as regulatory hedges in 2022, influence the presentation of fair value disclosures in SO's 2024 financial statements, and what might this shift suggest about evolving regulatory cost recovery expectations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that energy-related derivatives, including those designated as regulatory hedges, were initially recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities and later recognized in fuel expense through approved cost recovery mechanisms. This included $2.0 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at the parent entity, indicating the scale of derivative activity being managed. By 2024, the fair value of these derivatives was presented in the balance sheets under 'Other' or as 'Risk Management Activities,' suggesting a shift toward more transparent fair value reporting. This evolution may imply that the company is adapting its derivative disclosures to reflect either a change in regulatory stance on cost recovery or a strategic move toward more market-sensitive risk management practices.",

See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.\n\nEnergy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:\n\n- Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.\n- Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.\n- Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.\n\nSome energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Nicor Gas maintained a LIFO inventory balance of $186 million, with an estimated replacement cost of $268 million. By 2024, the LIFO inventory balance increased slightly to $188 million, while the estimated replacement cost rose significantly to $326 million. This widening gap between LIFO balance and replacement cost suggests higher inflationary pressure on natural gas inventory costs in 2024. Since Nicor Gas uses the LIFO method for inventory valuation and recovers gas costs through a purchased gas recovery mechanism, the increased replacement cost in 2024 would have resulted in higher customer bill adjustments compared to 2023, despite LIFO liquidations having no direct impact on net income. This reflects a greater need for cost recovery in 2024 due to rising natural gas prices.",

Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes the average cost of propane gas inventory, liquefied natural gas inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies. Materials and supplies for Southern Power generally includes the average cost of generating plant materials.\n\nMaterials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.\n\n## Fuel Inventory\n\nFuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and emissions allowances. Fuel inventory for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil, natural gas, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost, as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric operating companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.\n\n## Natural Gas for Sale\n\nWith the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a weighted average cost of gas basis. In Georgia's deregulated, competitive environment, Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a monthly basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract, along with a corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets and related natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.\n\nNicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted for differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income. At December 31, 2024, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was $188 million. Based on the average cost of gas purchased in December 2024, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at December 31, 2024 was $326 million.\n\n## Provision for Uncollectible Accounts\n\nThe customers of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are billed monthly. For the majority of receivables, a provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on historical collection ex perience and other factors. For the remaining receivables, if the company is aware of a specific customer's inability to pay, a provision for",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO maintained a significant investment in SNG, with holdings reported at $127 million in 2021 and $129 million in 2020, reflecting SO's ongoing commitment to natural gas infrastructure through SNG. By 2024, SNG was disclosed as developing a $3 billion pipeline expansion project aimed at increasing its pipeline capacity by 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, with SO holding a 50% ownership stake. This sustained investment indicates that SO is doubling down on its long-term natural gas strategy, leveraging SNG to expand supply infrastructure to meet growing regional demand. However, SO's 50% cost exposure to a $3 billion project also increases its risk profile, particularly given regulatory uncertainty and the long timeline to completion in 2029. The continuation of SO's investment through SNG demonstrates a strategic alignment with fossil-based infrastructure, even as broader energy markets trend toward decarbonization.",

In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 46% were with BBB+ to BBBor equivalent rated counterparties, and 6% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fix ed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 78,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. G as distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. SNG is developing a proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, which the operator of the joint venture anticipates will be completed by 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NEE's Options - Power had a fair value of $48 million in assets and $5 million in liabilities, with implied volatilities ranging from 33% to 310% and a weighted average of 119%. By 2024, the fair value of Options - Power decreased to $9 million in assets and $6 million in liabilities, while the implied volatilities increased significantly, ranging from 78% to 360% with a weighted average of 186%. This indicates that NEE's continued use of option models in 2024 led to a more volatile and less valuable Options - Power portfolio, reflecting a shift in market expectations or risk exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE(2023) \u2192 Option Models: NEE used option models to value its Options - Power, which had a fair value of $48 million in assets and $5 million in liabilities, with implied volatilities ranging from 33% to 310%.",
        "Hop 2: Option Models \u2192 Options - Power: The valuation technique for Options - Power relied on option models, incorporating significant unobservable inputs like implied volatilities.",
        "Hop 3: Options - Power \u2190 NEE(2024): In 2024, NEE's Options - Power portfolio had a reduced fair value of $9 million in assets and $6 million in liabilities, with higher implied volatilities ranging from 78% to 360%."

      "question": "How did the increase in PowerSecure's distributed infrastructure project revenues of $120 million in 2024 compared to 2023 reflect the strategic focus on Distributed Energy Solutions by Southern Company, and what was the corresponding impact on their cost of sales at PowerSecure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company emphasized its focus on Distributed Energy Solutions through its subsidiary PowerSecure, which develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids. This strategic direction directly influenced PowerSecure's performance in 2024, where operating revenues increased by $120 million, largely due to distributed infrastructure projects. However, this growth came with an increase in the cost of sales by $82 million in 2024 compared to 2023, also tied to these distributed infrastructure projects. The cost increase reflects the investment required to support the growth in revenues, demonstrating the direct relationship between Southern Company's strategic focus in 2023 and the financial performance and resource allocation at PowerSecure in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Distributed Energy Solutions: Southern Company emphasized its strategic focus on Distributed Energy Solutions through its subsidiary PowerSecure in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Distributed Energy Solutions \u2192 PowerSecure: PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions, aligning directly with the strategic emphasis on Distributed Energy Solutions.",
        "Hop 3: PowerSecure \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, PowerSecure experienced a $120 million revenue increase from distributed infrastructure projects and a corresponding $82 million increase in cost of sales, showing the impact of Southern Company's earlier strategic focus."

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company incurred a $96 million pre-tax charge related to disallowed capital investments at Nicor Gas, which likely reduced Nicor Gas' retained earnings. By 2024, regulatory restrictions limited Nicor Gas to dividend or loan amounts only up to its retained earnings balance, and the total retained earnings available for dividend payment from Southern Company Gas' subsidiaries, including Nicor Gas, amounted to $1.6 billion. This suggests that the 2023 financial impact on Nicor Gas may have constrained its retained earnings base, thereby influencing the amount available for dividends in 2024 under the regulatory framework.",

      "question": "How did the change in NEE's pension plan asset allocation for convertible securities between 2022 and 2024 reflect the evolution of its investment strategy through the use of convertible limited partnerships?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan allocated 10% of its target asset allocation to convertible securities, including investments through a convertible security-oriented limited partnership. By 2024, this allocation decreased to 5%, while maintaining the use of a convertible security-oriented limited partnership as part of its broader investment strategy. This reduction indicates a strategic shift toward lower exposure to convertible securities, potentially reflecting a more conservative approach or a rebalancing toward alternative and fixed income investments, which grew from 13% to 20% and remained stable at 32%, respectively.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PowerSouth owned generating units with more than 1,600 MWs of nameplate capacity, including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power's Plant Miller Units 1 and 2. By 2023, Southern Company had formalized joint ownership arrangements with PowerSouth, as evidenced by Alabama Power's jointly owned facilities that were now being operated and maintained by Alabama Power on behalf of PowerSouth. This evolution suggests a deepening integration of asset ownership and operational responsibilities between Southern Company's subsidiaries and PowerSouth, moving from a partial ownership stake in existing generation capacity to more structured joint operational arrangements.",

      "answer": "In 2022, nuclear units contributed approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. These nuclear facilities were subject to health risks, particularly from potential harmful effects of radioactive material releases and long-term spent fuel storage uncertainties. By 2024, the nuclear generation contribution shifted to 25% for Alabama Power and 34% for Georgia Power, indicating a relative increase in Georgia's nuclear output. This shift likely altered the company's exposure profile to health risks, especially given the increased operational intensity in Georgia and the associated capital expenditures for security and maintenance. The NRC's regulatory oversight remained a constant factor, with potential fines or shutdowns still applicable in case of noncompliance, suggesting that the evolving generation mix may have introduced new risk dynamics despite consistent regulatory pressures.",

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

Achievement of these goals is dependent on various factors, many of which the Southern Company system does not control, including load growth across the Southern Company system's service territory, energy policy and regulations, natural gas prices, and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to economically transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet through a diverse portfolio of resources including low-carbon and carbon-free resources; making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing to implement effective energy efficiency and demand response programs; customer demand for carbon-free energy; implementing initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution emissions; continuing research and development with a focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future. There is no guarantee that the Southern Company system will achieve these goals.\n\nSee MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters - Environmental Laws and Regulations -Greenhouse Gases\" in Item 7 herein for additional information.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions.

The difference for both years is net of an approximately $1.5 billion impairment charge  in  2020  related  to  NextEra  Energy  Resources'  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2022,  NextEra  Energy  Resources  recorded  an  additional impairment  charge  to  completely  write  off  its  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline.  See  Note  4  -  Nonrecurring  Fair  Value  Measurements  for  a  discussion  of  the  impairment charges.\n\nNextEra  Energy  Resources  provides  operational,  management  and  administrative  services  as  well  as  transportation  and  fuel  management services to NEP and its subsidiaries under various agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a cash sweep and credit support (CSCS) agreement with a subsidiary of NEP. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash sweep amounts (due to NEP and its subsidiaries)  held  in  accounts  belonging  to  NextEra  Energy  Resources  or  its  subsidiaries  were  approximately  $57  million  and  $10  million, respectively,  and  are  included  in  accounts  payable.  Fee  income  related  to  the  CSCS  agreement  and  the  service  agreements  totaled approximately $148 million, $120 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in operating revenues in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Amounts due from NEP of approximately $113 million and $68 million are included  in  other  receivables  and  $40  million  and  $32  million  are  included  in  noncurrent  other  assets  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.  See  also  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests  for  amounts  due  to  NEP  for reimbursement of construction-related costs. NEECH or NextEra Energy Resources guaranteed or provided indemnifications, letters of credit or surety bonds totaling approximately $3,778 million at December 31, 2021 primarily related to obligations on behalf of NEP's subsidiaries with maturity  dates  ranging  from  2022  to  2059,  including  certain  project  performance  obligations,  obligations  under  financing  and  interconnection agreements and obligations, primarily incurred and future construction payables, associated with the December 2021 sale of projects to NEP (see Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests). Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. At December 31, 2021, approximately $41 million related to the fair value of the credit support provided under the CSCS agreement is recorded as noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## 9. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\n\nNEER - At  December 31, 2021, NEE consolidates a number of VIEs within the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered  the  primary  beneficiary  of  these  VIEs  since  they  control  the  most  significant  activities  of  these  VIEs,  including  operations  and maintenance, and they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.\n\nEight indirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have an ownership interest ranging from approximately 50% to 67% in entities which own and operate solar facilities with the capability of producing a total of approximately 772 MW. Each of the subsidiaries is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates ranging from 2035 through 2052. These entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $1,851 million and $1,258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. There were three of these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2020, and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $751 million and $607 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.\n\nNEE consolidates a NEET VIE that is constructing an approximately 280-mile electricity transmission line. A  NEET subsidiary is  the  primary beneficiary  and  controls  the  most  significant  activities  during  the  construction  period,  including  controlling  the  construction  budget.  NEET  is entitled to receive 50% of the profits and losses of the entity. The assets and liabilities of the VIE totaled approximately $614 million and $64 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $423 million and $68 million,",

      "question": "How did the expansion of Duke Energy's storm recovery property acquisition in 2024, particularly into South Carolina, reflect changes in state legislation compared to 2022, and what does this indicate about the evolving regulatory framework for financing storm-related costs?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy formed two special purpose subsidiaries (DECNCSF and DEPNCSF) and issued $237 million and $770 million in storm recovery bonds to finance unrecovered regulatory assets related to storms from 2018 and 2019 in North Carolina. These storm recovery properties were created under North Carolina state legislation and NCUC financing orders. By 2024, Duke Energy expanded this model to South Carolina, forming DEPSCSF and issuing $177 million in bonds to finance storm costs incurred from 2014 through 2022, indicating that South Carolina had enacted similar legislation to allow for storm recovery bonds. This evolution shows that state legislation in both North and South Carolina has increasingly supported cost recovery mechanisms for storm-related expenses, enabling Duke Energy to utilize non-bypassable customer charges as a dedicated funding source. This regulatory development reflects a broader acceptance of structured financing tools for utility resilience planning.",

D uke E nergy is working to m eet growing and evolving custom er energy needs while balancing custom er reliability and affordability, and other priorities including the need to m odernize its fleet and the regulatory construct. D uke E nergy is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, econom ic and com petitive uncertainties and contingencies, m any of which are beyond its control and may m ake those goals difficult to achieve.\n\nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable D uke E nergy to reduce its carbon em issions. F or exam ple, D uke E nergy anticipates that its nuclear stations in N orth C arolina and South C arolina will continue to qualify for significant tax incentives in the form  of nuclear production tax credits under the IR A. N uclear energy is a reliable and clean energy source and nuclear tax incentives allowed under the IR A, including nuclear production tax credits, are expected to reduce the cost of the energy transition for our custom ers. If such nuclear production tax credits were elim inated or reduced, it could negatively im pact our ability to return the anticipated cost benefits to custom ers.\n\nAdditionally, new E P A rules issued in April 2024 im pose stringent G H G  em ission reduction standards, revised air toxic lim its, and wastewater discharge lim itations that m ay im pact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational tim eline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies m ay be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transm ission and distribution upgrades needed to accom m odate the build out of large volum es of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the C om pany to continue to retire existing carbon em itting assets or m ake investm ents in new generating capacity. T he C om pany m ay be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on tim e. In addition, new technologies that are not yet com m ercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, D uke E nergy's ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\n\nMeeting the evolving and growing energy needs of our custom ers will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, m ay challenge our ability to m eet custom er expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environm ent, particularly as dem and increases. O ur nuclear fleet is central to our ability to m eet these objectives and custom er expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond m idcentury. F ailure to receive approval from  the N R C  for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\n\nAs a consequence, D uke E nergy m ay not be able to fully im plem ent or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which m ay have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\n\n## REGULATORY, LE GISLATIVE  AND LE GAL R ISK S\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of N orth C arolina, South C arolina, F lorida, O hio, T ennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility com m issions, retail electric and natural gas rates m ay be subject to review and possible reduction by the com m issions, which m ay decrease the D uke E nergy R egistrants' earnings. Additionally, if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a tim ely basis, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be negatively im pacted. D ifferences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as N orth C arolina and South C arolina in D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' service territory, m ay also result in failure to recover costs.\n\nI f legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the D uke E nergy R egistrants' exclusive rights to serve their regulated custom ers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively im pacted. F ederal and state regulations, laws, com m ercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to prom ote and expand the use of E E measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in D uke E nergy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in D uke E nergy service territories or result in custom ers leaving the electric distribution system  and an increase in custom er net energy m etering, which allows custom ers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit am ount. O ver tim e, custom er adoption of these technologies could result in D uke E nergy not being able to fully recover the costs and investm ent in generation.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's shift in short-term debt composition between 2023 and 2024 affect Nicor Gas's borrowing capacity and interest rate exposure under their shared credit arrangement?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's total short-term notes payable decreased from $2,314 million in 2023 to $1,338 million in 2024, with a corresponding drop in the weighted average interest rate from 5.7% to 4.8%. This was driven in part by a significant reduction in commercial paper outstanding from $1,794 million to $1,138 million. Within this structure, Nicor Gas's portion of notes payable dropped from $392 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024, with its weighted average interest rate declining from 5.5% to 4.6%. This indicates that Southern Company restructured its short-term debt in a way that reduced both the volume and cost of borrowing for Nicor Gas. Additionally, under their shared credit arrangement expiring in 2029, Nicor Gas had $700 million allocated for working capital needs in 2024, suggesting increased flexibility despite the reduced notes payable balance.",

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

By 2023, with the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 deferred to 2024 via ASU 2022-06, Southern Power executed contract amendments to replace LIBOR with SOFR in certain power purchase agreements (PPAs), applying the practical expedients under both ASUs. As of July 1, 2023, all debt and hedging arrangements had transitioned to SOFR, with no material impacts reported, showing that the deferral allowed for smoother execution and accounting treatment of the rate transition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 ASU 2020-04: Southern Company was subject to ASU 2020-04 in 2022, which eased accounting for LIBOR discontinuation, but the ultimate impact of transitioning to an alternative rate was still uncertain.",
        "Hop 2: ASU 2020-04 \u2192 ASU 2022-06: ASU 2022-06 deferred the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from 2022 to 2024, allowing continued use of the practical expedients for contract modifications and hedge accounting.",
        "Hop 3: ASU 2022-06 \u2190 SO(2023): Southern Company applied ASU 2022-06 in 2023, enabling Southern Power to amend PPAs to replace LIBOR with SOFR, with full transition of debt and hedging arrangements completed by July 1, 2023, with no material accounting impact."

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company maintained a governance structure where neither the company nor its subsidiaries (e.g., Alabama Power and Georgia Power) were allowed to engage in day-to-day management or mandate individual investment decisions for nuclear decommissioning funds. These responsibilities were delegated to unrelated third-party managers who operated within certain investment guidelines and had discretion to actively buy and sell securities to maximize returns. By 2024, this governance framework remained unchanged, with the same restrictions on Southern Company and its subsidiaries and continued delegation to third-party managers.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nDuring 2020, Alabama Power recorded increases totaling approximately $501 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule primarily as a result of management's completion of the closure design for the remaining ash pond and the addition of a water treatment system to the design of another ash pond. The additional estimated costs to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology primarily relate to inputs from contractor bids, design revisions, and changes in the expected volume of ash handling. During 2021, Alabama Power recorded increases totaling approximately $406 million to its AROs primarily related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule based on updated estimates for post-closure costs at its ash ponds and inflation rates.\n\nDuring the third quarter 2020, Georgia Power refined the cost estimates related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule, including updates to long-term post-closure care requirements, market pricing, and timing of future cash outlays and recorded an increase of approximately $411 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In September 2021, Georgia Power recorded a further increase of approximately $435 million to these AROs based on updated estimates for inflation rates and the timing of closure activities.\n\nIn September 2021, Mississippi Power recorded an increase of approximately $31 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule based on updated estimates for the timing of closure activities, post-closure costs at one of its ash ponds, and inflation rates.\n\nThe cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2021 using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Rate Plans\" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning\n\nThe NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The Funds are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers, neither Southern Company nor its subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated thirdparty managers with oversight by the management of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The Funds' managers are authorized, within certain investment guidelines, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the return on the Funds' investments. The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as trading securities.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power record the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note 13, as management believes that fair value best represents the nature of the Funds. Gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, are recorded in the regulatory liability for AROs in the balance sheets and are not included in net income or OCI. Fair value adjustments and realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.\n\nThe Funds at Georgia Power participate in a securities lending program through the managers of the Funds. Under this program, Georgia Power's Funds' investment securities are loaned to institutional investors for a fee. Securities loaned are fully collateralized by cash, letters of credit, and/or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately $42 million and $44 million, respectively, of the fair market value of Georgia Power's Funds' securities were on loan and pledged to creditors under the Funds' managers' securities lending program. The fair value of the collateral received was approximately $43 million and $45 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and can only be sold by the borrower upon the return of the loaned securities. The collateral received is treated as a non-cash item in the statements of cash flows.",

In September 2021, Georgia Power recorded a further increase of approximately $435 million to these AROs based on updated estimates for inflation rates and the timing of closure activities.\n\nIn September 2021, Mississippi Power recorded an increase of approximately $31 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule based on updated estimates for the timing of closure activities, post-closure costs at one of its ash ponds, and inflation rates.\n\nThe cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2021 using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Rate Plans\" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning\n\nThe NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The Funds are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers, neither Southern Company nor its subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated thirdparty managers with oversight by the management of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The Funds' managers are authorized, within certain investment guidelines, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the return on the Funds' investments. The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as trading securities.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power record the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note 13, as management believes that fair value best represents the nature of the Funds. Gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, are recorded in the regulatory liability for AROs in the balance sheets and are not included in net income or OCI. Fair value adjustments and realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.\n\nThe Funds at Georgia Power participate in a securities lending program through the managers of the Funds. Under this program, Georgia Power's Funds' investment securities are loaned to institutional investors for a fee. Securities loaned are fully collateralized by cash, letters of credit, and/or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately $42 million and $44 million, respectively, of the fair market value of Georgia Power's Funds' securities were on loan and pledged to creditors under the Funds' managers' securities lending program. The fair value of the collateral received was approximately $43 million and $45 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and can only be sold by the borrower upon the return of the loaned securities. The collateral received is treated as a non-cash item in the statements of cash flows.",

      "question": "How might the significant increase in interest rates on Nicor Gas's commercial paper financing from 2022 to 2023 (from 0.3% to 5.5%) have influenced its decision to completely discontinue short-term bank debt, and what does this suggest about SO's broader financing strategy for its natural gas operations?",
      "answer": "The weighted average interest rate on Nicor Gas's commercial paper financing increased dramatically from 0.3% in 2022 to 5.5% in 2023, yet Nicor Gas still chose to discontinue its short-term bank debt entirely (which had carried a 0.7% rate in 2022). This suggests that despite rising interest costs, SO may have prioritized flexibility or other strategic considerations in its financing approach for natural gas distribution operations, potentially signaling a shift toward more market-responsive capital structures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Nicor Gas: Nicor Gas was a key natural gas distribution utility within SO's portfolio, with its financial performance directly impacting SO's overall gas operations.",
        "Hop 2: Nicor Gas \u2192 Short-term Bank Debt: In 2022, Nicor Gas had $300 million in short-term bank debt at 0.7% interest, indicating a specific financing approach for its operations.",
        "Hop 3: Short-term Bank Debt \u2190 SO(2023): By 2023, Nicor Gas had completely discontinued short-term bank debt and relied solely on commercial paper financing at a significantly higher 5.5% rate, showing a strategic shift in SO's capital structure."

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that Southern Power had PPAs related to wind facilities accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 25 years. These leases included obligations for land restoration at the end of the lease terms. By 2023, Southern Power's ARO liability primarily related to these solar and wind facilities, indicating that the long-term lease commitments from 2022 had translated into recognized retirement obligations in 2023 due to the requirement to restore leased land. This shows a clear temporal evolution from lease arrangements in 2022 to recorded liabilities in 2023.",

By 2024, the company expanded its storm cost recovery efforts by forming DEPSC SF to issue an additional $177 million in bonds, this time focused on recovering costs from storms that occurred in South Carolina between 2014 and 2022. This represents a geographic expansion of the storm recovery financing mechanism from North Carolina to include South Carolina, while maintaining the use of bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries to issue bonds secured by storm recovery property and customer charges.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAtlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC.\n\nSee \"Rate Proceedings - Atlanta Gas Light\" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 18, 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024.\n\n## Chattanooga Gas\n\nIn June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.\n\n## Natural Gas Cost Recovery\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, the over recovered balance was $88 million, which was included in other regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.\n\n## Rate Proceedings\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.\n\nIn July 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of $37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.",

By 2024, the target allocation for alternative investments increased to 20%, indicating a strategic emphasis on expanding exposure to alternative assets, many of which are accessed through limited partnerships. This evolution in asset allocation reflects a broader strategic shift toward enhancing long-term returns while managing risk through increased diversification into alternative asset classes, which are largely structured through limited partnership vehicles.",

See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under \"Southern Company Gas\" and \"Southern Company Leveraged Lease,\" respectively, and Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" for information regarding impairment charges recorded during the periods presented.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities\n\nSouthern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas each evaluated its goodwill in the fourth quarter 2021 and determined no impairment was required. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" for information regarding impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in 2019.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, goodwill was as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to cyber intrusion risks affecting nuclear power plant operations in 2022 influence their strategic financial commitments to nuclear assets in 2023, particularly in terms of insurance coverage and decommissioning reserves?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company acknowledged that cyber intrusions posed a significant risk to the operation of nuclear power plants, with potential financial consequences exceeding available insurance coverage and decommissioning trust funds. Specifically, the 2022 filing noted that damages, decommissioning, or other costs could surpass the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance. In 2023, Southern Company maintained its stake in nuclear power plants through Southern Nuclear, which continued to operate and manage construction of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. Despite the acknowledged risks, the company did not disclose any material increase in insurance coverage or reserve adjustments, suggesting that strategic financial commitments to nuclear assets remained largely unchanged, even in the face of identified cybersecurity threats.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Cyber Intrusions: Southern Company identified cyber intrusions as a material risk to nuclear power plant operations, with potential costs exceeding insurance and decommissioning reserves.",

        "Hop 3: Nuclear Power Plants \u2190 SO(2023): Southern Company continued to operate and invest in nuclear assets through Southern Nuclear, including the ongoing construction of Plant Vogtle Unit 4, without disclosing material changes in risk mitigation expenditures or insurance levels."

There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company's regulatory mechanisms were adjusted annually or as needed within limits approved by state PSCs to recover environmental remediation costs and support infrastructure investments. These mechanisms allowed for cost recovery and a return on investment in regulated rates, particularly for Southern Company Gas' infrastructure replacement programs. By 2024, these regulatory mechanisms had evolved into more formalized alternative revenue programs, which now included components such as cost recovery for environmental remediation and infrastructure improvements, as well as revenues from leases and derivatives. The alternative revenue programs introduced in 2024 represented a structured evolution of the earlier regulatory mechanisms, reflecting a broader framework for revenue recognition beyond traditional customer contracts.",

By 2024, the credit risk exposure at Nicor Gas was explicitly stated to be mitigated by this Bad Debt Rider, which allowed for the recovery or refund of differences between actual bad debt experience and the benchmark used in base rates.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nuncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.\n\nCredit risk ex posure at Nicor G as is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 14 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk ex posure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest ex posure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit ex posure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, and interest rates. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets (included in \"Other\" or shown separately as \"Risk Management Activities\") and are measured at fair value. See Note 13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and Southern Company Gas' bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are ex cluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the \"normal\" scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.\n\nThe Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nThe purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company had a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward tax benefit tied to Florida that was set to expire starting in 2034, indicating a long-term tax planning horizon in that state. By 2023, Southern Company Gas maintained a 50% ownership interest in SNG, a major natural gas pipeline serving Florida, suggesting a strategic alignment between tax planning and infrastructure investment. The continued investment in SNG implies that Southern Company was reinforcing its operational footprint in Florida, which may have been a factor in the long-dated NOL expiration schedule observed in 2022.",

      "question": "How did the structure of Duke Energy's RSU award vesting periods in 2024 compare to the vesting schedule disclosed in 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to equity compensation design?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy disclosed a three-year vesting schedule specifically for additional employer contributions made to new and rehired employees not eligible for defined benefit plans. This vesting requirement was explicitly tied to retention incentives for those specific employee groups. In contrast, the 2024 filing shows that RSU awards have vesting periods ranging from immediate to three years, indicating a more flexible structure. The shift from a uniform three-year vesting schedule in 2023 to a range of vesting periods in 2024 RSU awards suggests Duke Energy refined its equity compensation design to allow for differentiated vesting terms based on employee roles or performance criteria, rather than applying a standard vesting period across certain groups.",

In 2021, Nicor Gas experienced a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses due to higher natural gas revenues, which were passed through to customers and had no impact on net income. Prior to the sale, wholesale gas services played a key role in providing natural gas asset management and logistics services for Southern Company Gas' utilities (except Nicor Gas) and non-affiliated companies, as well as engaging in gas storage and pipeline arbitrage. After the sale, wholesale gas services was no longer a reportable segment in 2023, and its prior revenues were netted with costs from energy and risk management activities. This led to a structural change in how operating revenues and intercompany revenues were reconciled, reflecting a more consolidated reporting approach post-sale.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020.

See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on the disposition activities described herein.\n\nGas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and includes natural gas local distribution utilities that construct, manage, and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and gas distribution facilities in four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. Gas pipeline investments also includes a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline project, which was cancelled in September 2021, and through its March 24, 2020 sale, included a 5% ownership interest in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline construction project. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information.\n\nThrough July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services provided natural gas asset management and/or related logistics services for each of Southern Company Gas' utilities except Nicor Gas as well as for non-affiliated companies.

This approach is reinforced by the fact that Mississippi Power did not prepare separate annual reports for its parent company in either year, suggesting a deliberate effort to minimize duplicative disclosures and reduce regulatory filing burdens across entities. By leveraging General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d) of Form 10-K, The Southern Company appears to be standardizing compliance practices across its subsidiaries like Mississippi Power, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and others, which helps maintain uniformity and efficiency in regulatory reporting while still fulfilling SEC obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas classified its debt investments as AFS, indicating a strategy of holding these investments for the long term while recognizing changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. This classification was consistent across entities, as Duke Energy Florida also applied the AFS treatment to debt investments in the same year. By 2024, Duke Energy Florida continued to apply the AFS classification, but the context expanded to include reimbursement activities from the NDTF related to decommissioning costs, suggesting a more complex interplay between investment strategy and regulatory funding mechanisms. Meanwhile, Duke Energy Indiana also maintained the AFS classification for debt investments in 2024, showing consistency in accounting policy application across segments despite evolving operational contexts. This reveals that while the classification remained stable, the underlying rationale and external influences on debt investment management evolved over time.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company emphasized distributed energy solutions through PowerSecure, which develops microgrids for commercial, industrial, and utility customers. This strategic focus led to significant activity in distributed infrastructure projects, which directly contributed to PowerSecure experiencing a $120 million (20.0%) increase in operating revenues in 2024. However, this growth came with a corresponding $82 million (15.8%) rise in cost of sales in 2024, reflecting the capital and operational intensity of scaling these distributed energy initiatives.

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory uncertainties regarding the recovery of $1.692 billion in pre-tax charges related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction, stemming from schedule delays, contractor performance, and potential regulatory pushback from the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). By 2024, these uncertainties had evolved into a formalized audit focus, with Georgia Power's financial statements now including detailed disclosures on the impact of rate regulation and the risk of non-approval of full cost recovery by the Georgia PSC. The 2024 audit specifically highlighted the Commissions' role in determining the prudence of incurred costs and the timing of recovery, showing a clear progression from uncertainty in 2022 to structured regulatory and audit scrutiny in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "- For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n- We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.\n- We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n- We evaluated Southern Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n## Disclosure of Uncertainties - Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction - Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power Company's (Georgia Power) investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery, including ongoing or future challenges with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and estimated cost.\n\nIn addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $1.692 billion in 2021.\n\nIn addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1) the status of construction; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project. We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n- We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the projected in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule and to assess the disclosures of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of these units.\n- We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors), independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and schedule challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company, through Georgia Power, had a financial commitment of $42 million related to MEAG Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, with encumbrances extending to Units 3 and 4 via lien structures tied to Georgia Power\u2019s ownership stake. By 2024, the asset value of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 had increased from $24 million in 2023 to $41 million, indicating progress in construction and capital investment. This suggests that Southern Company\u2019s exposure to MEAG Power\u2019s stake in the Vogtle expansion may have shifted from a liability-focused relationship (with emphasis on capacity purchase commitments and liens) to a more asset-centric one, reflecting the growing value of Units 3 and 4 as they neared completion.",

See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner holding the same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 76,289 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf.

In 2024, net income rebounded with a $109M increase, despite lower gas cost recovery, due to rate increases and reduced exposure to weather variability through mechanisms like weather normalization and derivative instruments.

          "chunk_text": "\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nThe gas distribution operations segment is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fix ed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest ex pense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixedvariable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $109 million, or 24.7%, compared to 2023. Operating revenues decreased $206 million primarily due to lower gas cost recovery, partially offset by rate increases. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses decreased $390 million primarily due to a $412 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the $88 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher compensation and benefits expenses, and higher revenue taxes. The decrease in operating expenses also includes costs passed through directly to customers, primarily related to bad debt ex pense, energy efficiency programs, and revenue taxes. The decrease in net income also includes an increase of $46 million in income taxes primarily as a result of higher pre-tax  earnings and an increase of $36 million in interest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects - Nicor Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Pipeline Investments\n\nThe gas pipeline investments segment consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Marketing Services\n\nThe gas marketing services segment provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $11 million, or 12.1%, compared to 2023. The increase was due to a $43 million decrease in operating expenses primarily related to a decrease in cost of natural gas, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in operating revenues primarily due to lower retail margins.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "answer": "In 2023, SEGCO had long-term debt with variable interest tied to a November 2024 maturity, but no short-term debt outstanding. By 2024, SEGCO remained subject to cross-acceleration provisions under Southern Company's broader credit arrangements, which limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization for subsidiaries like SEGCO. At the end of 2024, SEGCO was in compliance with these covenants, and a portion of Southern Company\u2019s unused credit was allocated to support SEGCO\u2019s commercial paper program. This evolution shows that Southern Company maintained tight credit risk controls across its subsidiaries, ensuring SEGCO remained within defined leverage limits while preserving liquidity flexibility through shared credit facilities.",

In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "question": "How did the shift in NEE's use of option models for power derivatives between 2022 and 2024 impact the fair value and implied volatility metrics of their 'Options - Power' portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's 'Options - Power' portfolio had a fair value of $52 million in assets and $1 million in liabilities, with a weighted average implied volatility of 81%. By 2024, the fair value of 'Options - Power' had decreased significantly to $9 million in assets and $6 million in liabilities. During this time, the company continued to use option models for valuation, but the implied volatilities increased to a weighted average of 186%, with a range of 78% to 360%. This indicates that while the portfolio size shrank, the underlying power market became more volatile, influencing NEE's modeling assumptions and resulting in higher implied volatility inputs in their option models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Option Models: NEE used option models to value its 'Options - Power' portfolio, which had a fair value of $52 million in assets and $1 million in liabilities, with implied volatilities averaging 81%.",
        "Hop 2: Option Models \u2192 Options - Power: NEE applied option models to value its power options, relying on inputs like implied correlations and volatilities, which are key unobservable inputs in the valuation technique.",
        "Hop 3: Options - Power \u2190 NEE(2024): By 2024, NEE continued to use option models for 'Options - Power', but the fair value had dropped to $9 million in assets and $6 million in liabilities, with implied volatilities now averaging 186%."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to the risk of non-recovery of investments in 2023 relate to Georgia Power Company's regulatory asset disclosures in 2024, and what does this indicate about the evolution of their regulatory risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company identified a significant risk related to the non-recovery of investments through regulated rates, particularly concerning incurred costs and return on invested capital, as noted in the 2023 10-K audit report. This risk was specifically tied to regulatory decisions by the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In 2024, Georgia Power Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company, disclosed its own exposure to similar regulatory risks, indicating that the Commissions' decisions could impact the recovery of costs and investments. The continuity of this risk across years suggests that Southern Company's regulatory risk profile remained elevated and was directly reflected in Georgia Power\u2019s financial disclosures, showing a stable but ongoing exposure to regulatory disallowances and rate recovery uncertainties.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Risk of Non-Recovery of Investments: Southern Company highlighted in its 2023 audit report that there was a risk that regulatory commissions would not approve full recovery of incurred costs or investments.",
        "Hop 2: Risk of Non-Recovery of Investments \u2192 Georgia Power Company: The 2024 audit report of Georgia Power Company, a subsidiary of Southern Company, also identified the same risk related to regulatory recovery of costs and investments.",
        "Hop 3: Georgia Power Company \u2190 SO(2024): Georgia Power\u2019s 2024 financial disclosures, including its Statements of Cash Flows, reflect the ongoing impact of these regulatory risks, which are directly tied to Southern Company\u2019s broader risk framework."

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas had a joint ownership stake in multiple facilities with NCEMC, including an 87.27% ownership interest in one facility and a 19.25% stake in another. By 2024, this relationship evolved as NCEMC expressed intent to co-own approximately 225 MW of the new Roxboro Plant CC Unit, signaling a strategic shift toward collaborative long-term infrastructure development. The Roxboro Plant CC Unit expansion, involving a second 1,360 MW hydrogen-capable unit, reflects Duke\u2019s plan to modernize and expand its generation capacity with regulatory filings targeting service by 2029.

      "question": "How did the fair value of full requirements and unit contingent contracts for NEE change from 2022 to 2024, and what role did the use of discounted cash flow valuation techniques play in reflecting shifts in forward pricing assumptions over this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the fair value of full requirements and unit contingent contracts for NEE was $200 million in assets and $566 million in liabilities. By 2024, this had shifted to $209 million in assets and $203 million in liabilities, indicating a significant decrease in liability valuation. The discounted cash flow technique was consistently used across both years, relying on forward price per MWh assumptions that evolved from a weighted average of $64 in 2022 to $76 in 2024. This suggests that while the forward pricing assumptions increased, the overall liability decreased, likely due to changes in market expectations or contract positions.",

        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Discounted Cash Flow: NEE used discounted cash flow to value full requirements and unit contingent contracts at $200M (assets) and $566M (liabilities) in 2022.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's environmental compliance costs in 2023 impact commercial customer demand projections, and how did Southern Power's long-term PPA structures in 2024 aim to mitigate potential revenue risks from any resulting demand shifts?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company identified that environmental compliance costs\u2014such as those related to CCR facility closures and GHG emission reductions\u2014could be recovered through regulated rates, but this might lead to reduced demand from commercial and industrial customers due to higher electricity and natural gas prices. By 2024, Southern Power had structured long-term PPAs with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years, covering 96% of investments under contract through 2029. These contracts, particularly the unit/block sales and requirements service agreements, were designed to ensure stable revenue recovery despite potential demand fluctuations from commercial customers affected by environmental regulations. The PPA structures aimed to insulate earnings from demand-side volatility by locking in capacity charges and contractual commitments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Environmental Requirements: Southern Company faced substantial compliance costs related to environmental regulations, including closure of CCR facilities and GHG emission reductions, which could be recovered through regulated rates but might reduce demand from commercial customers.",
        "Hop 2: Environmental Requirements \u2192 Commercial Customers: Many commercial and industrial customers were expected to be affected by environmental regulations, potentially leading to reduced electricity and natural gas demand due to increased costs.",
        "Hop 3: Commercial Customers \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Power's long-term PPAs, covering 96% of investments through 2029 with an average contract duration of 12 years, were designed to mitigate revenue risk from demand shifts by ensuring stable cost recovery through structured capacity charges and contractual commitments."

In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or ex pected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2024 was 96% through 2029 and 87% through 2034, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 46% were with BBB+ to BBBor equivalent rated counterparties, and 6% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fix ed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 78,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. G as distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. SNG is developing a proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, which the operator of the joint venture anticipates will be completed by 2029. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

      "question": "How did the storm recovery property acquisition funded by the 2021 bond issuance relate to Duke Energy's regulatory asset recovery strategy in 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about the consistency of their financing mechanism across years?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress issued $237 million and $770 million, respectively, in storm recovery bonds through special purpose subsidiaries to acquire storm recovery property tied to costs from 2018 and 2019. These assets were monetized via non-bypassable customer charges, which served as the sole repayment source for the bonds. By 2022, this mechanism was fully operational, with the storm recovery property secured by the bonds and collections used to satisfy debt obligations. In 2023, the structure remained unchanged, with the same storm recovery property still backing the bonds and the same collection mechanism in place. This reveals a consistent financing strategy where Duke Energy leveraged regulatory authority to recover past storm costs through a dedicated funding mechanism across both years.",

        "Hop 2: Storm Recovery Bonds \u2192 Storm Recovery Property: The proceeds from the bonds were used to acquire storm recovery property, which included the right to impose non-bypassable charges on retail customers to repay the bonds.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's investment strategy in natural gas pipelines through Louisiana change from 2022 to 2023, particularly in relation to its 50% interest in SNG and the geographic markets served by that pipeline?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's gas pipeline investments included a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline project (which was canceled in 2021) and served markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. By 2023, Southern Company Gas had refocused its pipeline investments, holding a 50% interest in SNG, which owns a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to the same set of markets. This shift reflects a strategic move from a minority stake in a canceled project to a major joint venture in a functioning pipeline with expanded supply connectivity. The 2023 investment in SNG was central to Southern Company Gas' strategy of providing diverse natural gas supplies to its customers across the Southeastern U.S.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Louisiana: Southern Company Gas operated in Louisiana and other Southern states, with pipeline investments including the now-canceled PennEast Pipeline project.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Southern Company's wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased by $77 million, or 69.4%, primarily driven by higher natural gas prices. These affiliate sales were conducted under the Intercompany Interchange Agreement (IIC), which was administered by Southern Company Services (SCS) and governed by FERC. The IIC facilitated coordinated power pool operations among Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. By 2024, Southern Company continued to rely on SCS for these power pool transactions, as evidenced by the inclusion of SCS service costs in financial statements under operations and maintenance expenses or capitalized property, plant, and equipment. This indicates that while the financial impact of affiliate sales fluctuated, the structural dependency on SCS for managing IIC-based transactions remained consistent, highlighting the ongoing strategic importance of SCS in Southern Company's internal energy coordination framework.",

Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to nonaffiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $77 million, or 69.4%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an $86 million increase associated with higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a $10 million decrease associated with lower KWH sales.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.\n\n## Energy Sales\n\nChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year.

          "chunk_text": "the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. In February 2021, Southern Company joined a filing at the FERC proposing a Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) that included many of the other electric service providers in the Southeast. In October 2021, the proposal became effective by operation of law following a tie vote by the FERC, subject to certain rehearing requests. A petition for appeal has been filed regarding the FERC's orders. SEEM is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants will use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. SEEM is expected to begin service in mid-2022. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\nThe utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions with third parties. In connection with the sale of former subsidiary Gulf Power in January 2019, an appendix was added to the IIC setting forth terms and conditions governing Gulf Power's continued participation in the IIC for a defined transition period. On December 21, 2021, NextEra Energy provided a 180-day notice of its intention to leave the Southern Company power pool.\n\nSouthern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See \"Regulation - Nuclear Regulation\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nSouthern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW - \"Business Activities\" in Item 7 herein.\n\nSouthern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue natural gas and renewable generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2021, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners, totaled 12,446 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,066 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries).

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Power amended its $60 million letter of credit facility, extending its expiration from 2023 to 2025 and increasing the amount to $75 million, which improved liquidity and financial flexibility for its operations. This restructuring had implications for Southern Company Gas' broader credit framework, under which Nicor Gas was allocated $700 million in a multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2026, specifically for working capital needs. However, in 2023, Nicor Gas faced a $96 million pre-tax disallowance charge tied to certain capital investments, which likely constrained its ability to fully utilize or request adjustments to its allocated credit capacity. Thus, while the 2022 credit enhancements should have improved capital access, the 2023 regulatory disallowance limited Nicor Gas' financial maneuverability within that framework.",

Subsequent to December 31, 2021, Southern Power amended its $60 million letter of credit facility, which, among other things, extended the expiration date from 2023 to 2025 and increased the amount to $75 million. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(b) Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $800 million of the arrangement expiring in 2026 and all $250 million of the arrangement expiring in 2022. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2026 also includes $700 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2026, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted. See \"Structural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas.

In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration or, in the case of Southern Power, cross-default provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Such crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Southern Power defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt excludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is nonrecourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants.

      "answer": "Southern Company's approach evolved from standalone battery storage projects like the 88 MW Garland Solar Storage facility completed in 2023 to integrated solar + storage developments in 2024. The 2024 filings show plans for the 512 MW Haskell County complex in Texas (200 MW Phase I in Q4 2025, 180 MW Phase II in Q2 2026, and 132 MW Phase III in Q4 2026), which represents a shift toward vertically integrated renewable systems. This strategic shift suggests that experience with Garland's standalone 88 MW battery storage system informed Southern Company's decision to combine solar generation with storage capabilities in new developments, creating more comprehensive renewable energy solutions.",

      "question": "How did the shift in valuation methodology inputs for NEE's gas-related options between 2022 and 2024, particularly in implied volatility and correlation assumptions, affect the fair value of these instruments over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's 'Options - primarily gas' had a total fair value of $703 million (assets + liabilities = $356M + $347M), with a weighted-average implied volatility of 36% and implied correlation of 52%. By 2024, the total fair value of these gas-related options dropped to $202 million ($100M + $102M), while the valuation model inputs evolved to a weighted-average implied volatility of 52% and a much higher implied correlation of 99%. The significant decline in fair value despite increased volatility suggests a major shift in market dynamics or risk perception, with the valuation models reflecting more stable correlation assumptions over time.",

        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Option Models: In 2022, NEE used option models for 'Options - primarily gas' with a weighted-average implied volatility of 36% and implied correlation of 52%, resulting in a total fair value of $703 million.",
        "Hop 2: Option Models \u2192 Options - Primarily Gas: The valuation technique for gas options consistently used option models in both years, with detailed disclosures about the significant unobservable inputs like implied volatility and correlation that directly influenced fair value calculations.",
        "Hop 3: Options - Primarily Gas \u2190 NEE(2024): By 2024, the fair value of NEE's gas options had declined to $202 million, while the valuation inputs had changed to a higher weighted-average implied volatility of 52%, and significantly higher implied correlation of 99%."

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan allocated 45% to equity investments, 32% to fixed income, 13% to alternative investments, and 10% to convertible securities, with registered investment companies being a key vehicle within its commingled investment arrangements. By 2024, the allocation had shifted to 43% equity, 32% fixed income, 20% alternative investments, and 5% convertible securities. This reallocation increased the emphasis on alternative investments while reducing convertible securities, suggesting a strategic pivot toward more diversified and potentially higher return assets. Registered investment companies remained a core component of the pension plan\u2019s diversified strategy across both years, though the changing allocation reflects a recalibration in risk and return expectations over time.",

These covenants were specifically tied to long-dated junior subordinated debentures (due 2066 and 2067 respectively). By 2024, as shown in the 2024 10-K filing, NEE continued to maintain compliance with these same Replacement Capital Covenants for the Series B and Series C instruments, indicating continuity in their capital structure commitments despite creating new debt series in early 2025 (February 4, 2025 certificates for debentures due between 2028 and 2055). This demonstrates that NEE preserved its covenant framework established through FPL Group Capital Inc while expanding its debt portfolio.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's reliance on Southern Nuclear for nuclear-related services evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in relation to the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 4 and the continuation of construction management services?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's reliance on Southern Nuclear for nuclear-related services remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, with Georgia Power continuing to incur significant costs for these services even after the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. In 2022, Georgia Power paid $895 million for Southern Nuclear's services, which increased slightly to $899 million in 2023, indicating a minimal increase of approximately $4 million (or 0.45%). This ongoing cost reflects that Southern Nuclear continued to provide critical construction management services for Plant Vogtle Unit 4 through 2023, as explicitly stated in both filings, and suggests that the contractual obligations between Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear remained in place despite the unit reaching operational milestones.",

In January 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).\n\nPursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more from the seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8 under \"Long-term Debt - DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\" for additional information.\n\nGeorgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact the calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other V ogtle Owners have asserted that the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the Global Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February 14, 2022.",

This pattern persisted in 2023, where Georgia Power again used the same reduced disclosure format, indicating that Southern Company maintained a consistent regulatory reporting strategy across its subsidiaries.

Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern Company Gas Capital for its financing needs.\n\nSouthern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loan, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangement are unsecured senior indebtedness, which rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Company. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under any of these unsecured senior debt arrangements, which are effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of creditors of Southern Power's subsidiaries.\n\n## 9.

Alabama Power is not party to this arrangement.\n\n(c) Does not include S outhern Pow er Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2027 and 2026, respectively, of which $16 million and $11 million, respectively, w as unused at December 31, 2024. S outhern Pow er's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.\n\n(d) Southern Company G as, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of S outhern Company G as Capital, w hich is the borrow er of $800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2029. S outhern Company G as' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for w hich Nicor G as is the borrow er and w hich is restricted for w orking capital needs of Nicor G as. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fix ed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit.

      "question": "How did the valuation technique used for NextEra Energy's (NEE) Forward Contracts - Power change from 2022 to 2024, and what does the shift in weighted-average forward price per MWh indicate about their power price forecasting assumptions over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE used the discounted cash flow method to value Forward Contracts - Power, with a weighted-average forward price of $37 per MWh. By 2024, the company continued using discounted cash flow, but the weighted-average forward price increased to $52 per MWh. This indicates that NEE's assumptions for future power prices became more optimistic over time, as reflected in the higher forward pricing assumption. The range of forward prices also widened from $(5) to $140 in 2022, to $(3) to $233 in 2024, suggesting increased volatility in power price expectations.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's reliance on regulatory mechanisms to recover storm costs in 2023 evolve into its use of alternative revenue programs in 2024, and what specific changes in program structure or accounting treatment reflect this shift?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy indicated its intent to continue seeking recovery of storm costs through regulatory mechanisms, particularly referencing storm securitization and cost recovery under Note 4 of its financial statements. By 2024, the company had formalized its approach by accounting for certain regulatory programs, including decoupling mechanisms, as alternative revenue programs. These programs, which are contracts between the company and its regulator, allowed Duke Energy to recognize revenue during periods of shortfall or excess usage, with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability established for future billing or refund to customers. The shift reflects a more structured and proactive approach to revenue stabilization, with a specific emphasis on regulatory alignment and performance-based incentives, as detailed in Note 19 of the 2024 filings.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nDuke E nergy recognizes revenue as custom ers obtain control of prom ised goods and services in an am ount that reflects consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, the delivery of electricity and natural gas results in the transfer of control to custom ers at the tim e the com m odity is delivered and the am ount of revenue recognized is equal to the am ount billed to each custom er, including estim ated volum es delivered when billings have not yet occurred. See N ote 19 for further inform ation.\n\n## Alternative R evenue Programs\n\nDuke E nergy accounts for certain types of program s established by the regulators in the states in which it operates, including decoupling m echanism s, as alternative revenue program s. Alternative revenue program s are contracts between an entity and its regulator, not a contract between an entity and a custom er. R evenue arising from  alternative revenue program s is presented as R egulated electric revenues and R egulated natural gas revenues on the C onsolidated Statem ents of O perations. R evenue from  alternative revenue program s is recognized in the period they are earned (i.e., during the period of revenue shortfall or excess due to fluctuations in custom er usage or when specific targets are m et resulting in the achievem ent of perform ance incentives or penalties) and a regulatory asset or liability on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets is established, which is subsequently billed or refunded to custom ers. D uke E nergy recognizes revenue as alternative revenue program s for program s that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determ inable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within 24 m onths. See N ote 19 for disaggregated revenue inform ation including revenue from  contracts with custom ers and revenues recognized as alternative revenue program s.\n\n## Derivatives and H edging\n\nDerivative and non-derivative instrum ents m ay be used in connection with com m odity price and interest rate activities, including swaps, futures, forwards and options. All derivative instrum ents, except those that qualify for the N P N S exception, are recorded on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Q ualifying derivative instrum ents m ay be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. O ther derivative instrum ents (undesignated contracts) either have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges. T he effective portion of the change in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in AO C I. T he effective portion of the change in the fair value of a fair value hedge is offset in net incom e by changes in the hedged item . F or activity subject to regulatory accounting, gains and losses on derivative contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities and not as other comprehensive incom e or current period incom e. As a result, changes in fair value of these derivatives have no im m ediate earnings im pact.\n\nForm al docum entation, including transaction type and risk m anagem ent strategy, is m aintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and at least every three m onths thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if it is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged item s.\n\nSee Note 15 for further inform ation.\n\n## Captive Insurance R eserves\n\nDuke E nergy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on an indem nity basis, to the Subsidiary R egistrants as well as certain third parties, on a lim ited basis, for financial losses, prim arily related to property, workers' com pensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for estim ated losses incurred but not reported (IBN R ), as well as estim ated provisions for known claim s. IBN R  reserve estim ates are prim arily based upon historical loss experience, industry data and other actuarial assum ptions. R eserve estim ates are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from  experience.\n\nDuke E nergy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization is deem ed probable.\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nPreferred stock is reviewed to determ ine the appropriate balance sheet classification and em bedded features, such as call options, are evaluated to determ ine if they should be bifurcated and accounted for separately. C osts directly related to the issuance of preferred stock are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received. T he liability for the dividend is recognized when declared. The accum ulated dividends on the cum ulative preferred stock is recognized to net incom e available to D uke E nergy C orporation in the E P S calculation. See Note 20 for further inform ation.",

By 2024, Southern Power's wind facilities were primarily contracted through long-term PPAs without capacity charges, where revenue depended on energy output. Additionally, Southern Power reported $384 million of unutilized federal PTCs (Production Tax Credits) tied to wind and solar facilities, indicating a strategic shift toward leveraging tax credits through these PPAs.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO classified wind projects as having an up-to-30-year useful life, indicating a long-term asset strategy. However, in 2023, SO entered into a 12-year PPA for the Glass Sands wind project, which suggests a shorter-term contractual commitment despite the asset's longer potential lifespan. This indicates a strategic choice to adopt a more flexible approach to wind energy deployment, possibly to align with evolving market conditions or resource needs, rather than committing to the full life of the asset upfront.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy used a consolidated VIE (CRC) to manage credit risk on accounts receivable, indicating a broader use of VIE structures for financial risk mitigation. By 2024, the company had expanded its use of VIEs specifically for storm recovery financing through entities like DEPNC SF and DEPSC SF. DEPNC SF was formed in 2021 and consolidated by Duke Energy Progress to issue bonds against storm recovery property related to 2018\u20132019 costs, while DEPSC SF was formed in 2024 and issued $177 million in bonds to finance storm costs from 2014 through 2022. This evolution shows a strategic shift toward using VIEs for targeted, long-term financing of regulatory assets tied to storm recovery, leveraging non-bypassable customer charges as the sole repayment source and isolating financial risk within bankruptcy-remote entities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 VIE: In 2022, Duke Energy used a consolidated VIE (CRC) to sell accounts receivable and absorb collection losses.",
        "Hop 2: VIE \u2192 DEPNC SF: By 2024, Duke Energy Progress consolidated VIEs like DEPNC SF, formed in 2021, to issue storm recovery bonds backed by specific regulatory assets.",
        "Hop 3: DEPNC SF \u2190 DUK(2024): In 2024, DEPNC SF and newly formed DEPSC SF were used to issue bonds totaling $177 million in South Carolina alone, indicating an expanded use of VIEs for storm cost recovery."

          "chunk_text": "## MD&amp;A\n\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Derivatives and Hedging,' for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\n\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment as a result of the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the company has resumed standard payment arrangement options . The Duke Energy Registrants are still monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties' abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants have observed a significant increase in utility account arrears as of December 31, 2021. There is an expectation of an increase in charge-offs in the future and the Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Revenue,\" respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Variable Interest Entities.'\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.\n\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate selfinsured retention. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Guarantees and Indemnifications,' for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants' policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company identified microgrids as a critical emerging technology that could reshape its business model and drive future growth. This strategic emphasis led to increased deployment of microgrids through its subsidiary PowerSecure. In 2024, PowerSecure's revenue grew by $120 million, primarily driven by distributed infrastructure projects, which include microgrid installations. Correspondingly, the cost of sales for PowerSecure increased by $82 million, also tied to these distributed infrastructure projects, indicating that the strategic push toward microgrids significantly influenced both the top-line growth and the associated cost increases in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company held a stake in PowerSecure, which had previously undergone a $119 million goodwill impairment in 2022 due to declining macroeconomic conditions affecting its cash flows. By 2024, PowerSecure was still a key part of Southern Company's portfolio, specifically highlighted for its deployment of microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. Southern Company's 2024 financial statements further emphasized the integration of microgrids as a strategic initiative, indicating a renewed investment focus on distributed energy and resilience solutions.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How did the $96 million pre-tax charge from Nicor Gas' regulatory disallowances in 2023 influence Southern Company's approach to capital investments in 2024, particularly in light of the continued recognition of regulatory disallowances in property valuation disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company incurred a $96 million pre-tax charge from Nicor Gas due to regulatory disallowances on certain capital investments, signaling early risk in gas distribution operations. This disallowance was further highlighted in the 2023 MD&A as a factor impacting earnings, indicating that Southern Company was already under regulatory scrutiny in its gas segment. By 2024, the company continued to account for regulatory disallowances explicitly in property, plant, and equipment valuations, suggesting a strategic shift toward more transparent capital cost management in response to prior disallowances. The persistence of disallowance language in 2024's disclosures implies that the 2023 financial impact prompted a recalibration of investment risk and regulatory compliance in capital planning.",

      "question": "What was the primary driver of Southern Company Gas' $29 million net income decline from 2022 to 2023, and how do the company's weather normalization mechanisms and derivative instruments position it to manage weather-related earnings volatility in 2024?",
      "answer": "The $29 million net income decline for Southern Company Gas from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by lower gas volumes sold, which were influenced by weather conditions affecting customer consumption patterns. The company noted that, with the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, its earnings are sensitive to customer consumption patterns that depend on weather conditions and natural gas prices. To mitigate this risk, Southern Company Gas utilizes weather and revenue normalization mechanisms, as well as weather derivative instruments, to limit exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in its service territories. In 2024, the company remains exposed to weather variability, particularly in its renewable energy segment, where energy generation from solar and wind facilities is directly impacted by weather conditions. However, its existing risk mitigation strategies from 2023 provide a framework to better manage earnings volatility in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Customer Consumption Patterns: Net income declined by $29 million due to lower gas volumes sold, influenced by weather-dependent consumption patterns.",
        "Hop 2: Customer Consumption Patterns \u2192 Weather Conditions: Customer demand for natural gas is largely a function of weather conditions, particularly during the heating season, which directly impacts consumption and earnings.",
        "Hop 3: Weather Conditions \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Southern Power's renewable energy generation (solar and wind) remains weather-sensitive, but the company's use of weather normalization and derivative mechanisms from 2023 onward helps stabilize earnings against weather volatility."

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mississippi Power Company explicitly stated that it would not file an annual report with the SEC, as it was not required to send an annual report or proxy statement to its sole shareholder, The Southern Company (SO). By 2024, Mississippi Power Company was among the Southern Company subsidiaries that met the conditions in General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K, allowing it to file under the reduced disclosure format specified in General Instructions I(2)(b), (c), and (d). This shift indicates that while Mississippi Power previously opted out of SEC reporting entirely as a private subsidiary, it now participates in a streamlined public reporting framework. For The Southern Company, this transition means that Mississippi Power\u2019s disclosures are now integrated into the consolidated Form 10-K under a reduced format, altering the structure and content of SO\u2019s consolidated SEC filings by reducing the volume and specificity of subsidiary-level disclosures.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas leased a 50% undivided ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline, operated by The Williams Companies, Inc., for approximately $26 million annually through 2042. The lessee was responsible for maintenance and providing service under FERC-regulated tariffs. In 2024, the same ownership and lease structure persisted, with the lease amount remaining at $26 million annually. This indicates that SO's financial exposure and operational dependency on The Williams Companies, Inc. through the Dalton Pipeline remained stable year-over-year, with no changes to the contractual terms or ownership structure reported.",

By 2024, Georgia Power's ownership remained at 75%, but FP&L was now listed as holding a 25% stake in the plant, indicating a new joint ownership arrangement. This change reflects a strategic shift in how Southern Company structures its coal plant ownership, potentially distributing financial and operational responsibilities across more partners.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company had $1.2 billion in unutilized federal ITCs tied to investments in solar facilities, which were expected to be fully utilized by 2024. These investments supported the development and expansion of solar generation capacity, which in turn led to the creation of long-term PPAs. By 2024, Southern Power's unregulated distributed generation business had $67 million in contract assets related to these PPAs, indicating that the earlier ITC-backed investments had matured into revenue-generating contractual agreements.

      "question": "Did Duke Energy's 2023 tax-exempt bond allocation to its Ohio subsidiary influence its 2024 capital contributions to that entity, particularly given the relatively low levels of both compared to other business units?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy allocated $77 million in tax-exempt bonds to its Ohio subsidiary, a relatively modest amount compared to other subsidiaries like Duke Energy Indiana ($352 million). In 2024, Duke Energy made only $5 million in capital contributions to Duke Energy Ohio, consistent with the prior year. This suggests that the low bond allocation in 2023 did not lead to increased capital support in 2024, and the Ohio subsidiary appears to have remained a lower-priority investment area relative to others, as seen in both the bond allocation and contribution figures.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 Tax-exempt bonds: Duke Energy disclosed $77 million in tax-exempt bonds allocated to Duke Energy Ohio in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Tax-exempt bonds \u2192 Ohio: The $77 million bond allocation to Ohio was disclosed as part of the company's financing structure for that subsidiary.",
        "Hop 3: Ohio \u2190 DUK(2024): In 2024, Duke Energy made only $5 million in capital contributions to Duke Energy Ohio, consistent with the prior year and aligned with the limited bond allocation in 2023."

      "question": "How did Southern Power's wind facility investment strategy change between 2023 and 2024, and what were the implications for their power sales agreement structure and tax credit utilization?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Power's power sales agreements (PPAs) for wind facilities were structured with long-term contracts that included a weighted-average remaining term of approximately 15 years, factoring in the remaining life of production tax credits (PTCs) associated with repowered wind facilities. These agreements typically provided more stable revenue streams. By 2024, Southern Power increased its focus on wind and solar facilities, where PPAs no longer included capacity charges, instead relying solely on energy output and fixed pricing. This shift exposed Southern Power to greater variability in revenue due to weather, equipment performance, and transmission constraints. At the same time, Southern Power had $384 million in unutilized PTCs at the end of 2024, indicating a growing reliance on these credits to offset income tax expenses. The change in investment strategy introduced a more variable revenue model tied directly to facility output and increased dependency on tax credits to maintain profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Power Sales Agreements: Southern Power disclosed long-term PPAs with a weighted-average remaining contract term of approximately 15 years, including the remaining life of PTCs from repowered wind facilities.",
        "Hop 2: Power Sales Agreements \u2192 Wind Facilities: These agreements had substantial coverage of wind facility output, with structured revenue models that included capacity charges and fuel cost reimbursements.",
        "Hop 3: Wind Facilities \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Power's 2024 disclosures show a shift to PPAs without capacity charges, where revenue depends on energy output, and a growing reliance on PTCs, with $384 million in unutilized credits."

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nFor entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $75 million in 2021, $67 million in 2020, and $93 million in 2019 for Alabama Power and $77 million in 2021, $69 million in 2020, and $95 million in 2019 for Georgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $14 million in 2021, $12 million in 2020, and $14 million in 2019, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nIn 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% limited partnership interest in SP Solar to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic). A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest in SP Solar and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns the remaining 66% ownership in SP Solar. SP Solar qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited partnership and the 33% limited partner does not have substantive kick-out rights against the general partner.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, SP Solar had total assets of $6.1 billion, total liabilities of $408 million and $387 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33% to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.\n\nIn 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind to three financial investors. Southern Power owns 100% of the Class B membership interests and the three financial investors own 100% of the Class A membership interests. SP Wind qualifies as a VIE since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not have substantive kick-out rights against Southern Power.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Progress transferred storm recovery property rights related to North Carolina storm costs (incurred from 2018\u20132019) to a special purpose subsidiary, which issued bonds secured by the right to collect non-bypassable charges from retail customers. By 2024, Duke expanded this model to South Carolina, issuing $177 million in storm recovery bonds secured by property rights tied to storm costs from 2014\u20132022. This reflects a geographic and temporal extension of the same financing mechanism, using storm recovery property as the secured asset to fund outstanding regulatory liabilities.",

These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\n\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $237 million and $770 million of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The storm recovery property was created by state legislation and NCUC financing orders for the purpose of financing storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. The storm recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from all Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The storm recovery bonds are secured by the storm recovery property and cash collections from the storm recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress.

In M ay 2023, C IG F U R  I I  joined this partial settlem ent and P ublic Staff and C I G F U R  I I  filed a separate settlem ent reaching agreem ent on P I M s, T racking M etrics and the Residential D ecoupling M echanism  under the P BR  application.\n\nOn August 18, 2023, the N C U C  issued an order approving D uke E nergy P rogress' P BR  application, as m odified by the partial settlem ents and the order, including an overall retail revenue increase of $233 m illion in Year 1, $126 m illion in Year 2 and $135 m illion in Year 3, for a com bined total of $494 m illion. Key aspects of the order include the approval of N orth Carolina retail rate base for the historic base case of approxim ately $12.2 billion and capital projects and related costs to be included in the three-year M YR P , including $3.5 billion (North C arolina retail allocation) projected to go in service over the M YR P  period. T he order established an R O E  of 9.8% based upon an equity ratio of 53% equity and approved, with certain adjustm ents, depreciation rates and the recovery of grid im provem ent plan costs and certain deferred C O VID -related costs. Additionally, the R esidential D ecoupling M echanism and P I M s were approved as requested under the P BR  Application and revised by the partial settlem ents. As a result of the order, D uke E nergy P rogress recognized pretax charges of $28 m illion within I m pairm ent of assets and other charges, which prim arily related to certain C O VID -19 deferred costs, and $8 m illion within O perations, m aintenance and other, for the year ended D ecem ber 31, 2023, on the C onsolidated Statem ents of O perations. D uke E nergy P rogress im plem ented interim  rates on June 1, 2023, and im plem ented revised Year 1 rates and the residential decoupling on O ctober 1, 2023.\n\nI n O ctober 2023, C I G F U R  I I  and H aywood E lectric M em bership C orporation each filed a N otice of Appeal of the August 18, 2023 N C U C  order. Both parties were appealing certain matters that do not im pact the overall revenue requirem ent in the rate case. Specifically, they appealed the interclass subsidy reduction percentage, and C IG F U R  II also appealed the Custom er Assistance P rogram  and the equal percentage fuel cost allocation m ethodology. O n N ovem ber 6, 2023, the AG O  filed a N otice of C ross Appeal of the N C U C 's determ ination regarding the exclusion of electric vehicle revenue from  the residential decoupling m echanism . On Novem ber 9, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress, the P ublic Staff, C IG F U R  I I , and a num ber of other parties reached a settlem ent pursuant to which C IG F U R  II agreed not to pursue its appeal of the C ustom er Assistance P rogram . In July 2024, the Suprem e C ourt of N orth Carolina consolidated the appeal with the parallel appeal of the N C U C 's order regarding the D uke E nergy C arolinas P BR  application. Briefing is com plete and oral argum ents occurred on February 13, 2025. D uke E nergy P rogress anticipates a decision to be issued no later than the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n## 2023 South Carolina Storm Securitization\n\nOn M ay 31, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress filed a petition with the P SC SC  requesting authorization for the financing of D uke E nergy P rogress' storm  recovery costs through securitization due to storm  recovery activities required as a result of the following storm s: P ax, U lysses, M atthew, F lorence, M ichael, D orian, Izzy and Jasper. O n Septem ber 8, 2023, Duke E nergy P rogress filed a com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent with all parties on all cost recovery issues raised in the storm  securitization proceeding.\n\nThe evidentiary hearing occurred in Septem ber 2023. O n Septem ber 20, 2023, the P SC SC  approved the com prehensive settlem ent agreem ent and on O ctober 13, 2023, the P SC SC issued its financing order. T he storm  recovery bonds of $177 m illion were issued by D uke E nergy P rogress in April 2024 and storm  recovery charges were effective M ay 1, 2024. See Notes 7 and 18 for m ore inform ation.\n\n## 2022 South Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn Septem ber 1, 2022, D uke E nergy P rogress filed an application with the P SC SC  to request an increase in base rate retail revenues. O n January 12, 2023, D uke E nergy P rogress and the OR S, as well as other consum er, environm ental, and industrial intervening parties, filed a com prehensive Agreem ent and Stipulation of Settlem ent resolving all issues in the base rate proceeding. The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

      "question": "How did the legal challenges to the FIP for Alabama in 2023 affect SO's regulatory asset amortization in Alabama in 2024 regarding early coal plant retirements?",
      "answer": "The legal challenges to the FIP for Alabama in 2023, which were held in abeyance pending resolution of the SIP disapproval case, contributed to continued uncertainty around environmental compliance obligations. Despite this, SO (via Alabama Power) proceeded with early coal plant retirements, including Plant Barry Unit 5 and SEGCO's Plant Gaston Units 1\u20134, as part of compliance planning under the ELG rules. By 2024, Alabama Power had net book values of $944 million tied to these early retirements, down from $1.2 billion in 2023, indicating ongoing amortization of the regulatory asset established under the Environmental Accounting Order. This reflects a direct temporal link between the 2023 regulatory challenges and the 2024 financial treatment of asset retirement costs in Alabama.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 FIP for Alabama: SO, through Alabama Power, challenged the EPA\u2019s FIP for Alabama in 2023, which required NOx emission reductions and could increase compliance costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nOklahoma's and Utah's interstate transport SIPs to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit placed the Alabama SIP disapproval case in abeyance pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the venue issue.\n\nIn June 2023, the EPA published the 2015 Ozone NAAQS Good Neighbor federal implementation plan (FIP), which requires reductions in NO  emissions from sources in 23 states, including Alabama and Mississippi, to assure those states satisfy their Clean Air Act good neighbor obligations for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. Georgia and North Carolina have approved interstate transport SIPs addressing the 2015 Ozone NAAQS and are not subject to this rule. In June 2023, the State of Mississippi and Mississippi Power challenged the FIP for Mississippi in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In August 2023, the State of Alabama, Alabama Power, and PowerSouth Energy Cooperative challenged the FIP for Alabama in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Both cases are being held in abeyance pending resolution of the Mississippi SIP disapproval and Alabama SIP disapproval cases, respectively. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the FIP pending the disposition of petitions for review of the FIP in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and any petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's motion for partial voluntary remand of the FIP to address the administrative record deficiencies preliminarily identified by the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 10, 2024, the EPA published its supplemental response to comments on the FIP which addresses the administrative record deficiencies. On February 6, 2025, the EPA filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit requesting a 60-day abeyance of the FIP challenges so that the new Trump Administration can determine how to proceed with the litigation. X\n\nIn July and September 2023, the EPA published an Interim Final Rule and an updated Interim Final Rule that stays the implementation of the FIPs for states with judicially stayed SIP disapprovals, including Mississippi and Alabama, respectively. The Interim Final Rule revises the existing regulations to maintain currently applicable trading programs for those states.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the rule and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, implementation of the stayed FIPs may result in increased compliance costs.\n\n## Water Quality\n\nIn 2020, the EPA published the final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule (2020 ELG Rule), a reconsideration of the 2015 ELG rule's limits on bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater that extended the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The 2020 ELG Rule also updated the voluntary incentive program (VIP) and provided new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final rule revising the Steam Effluent Guidelines (2024 ELG Rule), which establishes more stringent limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion residual leachate to be met no later than December 31, 2029. The 2024 ELG Rule maintains the existing rule's permanent cessation of coal subcategory and the existing rule's VIP and adds a new cessation subcategory which allows units to cease coal combustion by December 31, 2034 as opposed to meeting the new more stringent requirements. The 2024 ELG Rule also establishes limitations for legacy wastewater which became effective on July 8, 2024. Numerous groups and states filed petitions for review challenging the rule in multiple federal circuit courts, and, on June 14, 2024, the challenges were consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 26, 2024, industry and state petitioners filed a motion to stay the rule pending judicial review, which was denied on October 10, 2024. The ultimate impact of the 2024 ELG Rule and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.\n\nAs required by the 2020 ELG Rule, in 2021, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each submitted initial notices of planned participation (NOPP) for applicable units seeking to qualify for these cessation of coal combustion or VIP subcategories that require compliance by December 31, 2028.\n\nAlabama Power submitted its NOPP to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) indicating plans to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 (700 MWs) and to cease using coal and begin operating solely on natural gas at Plant Barry Unit 4 (350 MWs) and Plant Gaston Unit 5 (880 MWs). Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO, indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (1,000 MWs). However, Alabama Power, in conjunction with Georgia Power, is evaluating extending the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the indicated retirement date. The NOPP submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. Plant Barry Unit 4 ceased using coal and began to operate solely on natural gas in December 2022. See Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" and \"SEGCO,\" respectively, for additional information.\n\nThe remaining assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural gas, have net book values totaling approximately $944 million (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2024. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs, associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order).

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas reported a $29 million decrease in net income primarily due to lower gas volumes sold, which were influenced by weather-related consumption patterns (SO_10k_2023.pdf:page_86:chunk_3). The non-Atlanta Gas Light utilities were particularly exposed to these fluctuations, as their revenues were tied to customer consumption affected by weather conditions and natural gas prices. In response, Southern Company Gas implemented mechanisms such as weather normalization and weather derivative instruments to mitigate this exposure. By 2024, these regulatory strategies were further refined to limit earnings volatility from weather changes within typical ranges across their service territories (SO_10k_2024.pdf:page_194:chunk_1). Despite these efforts, the company continued to face challenges in stabilizing revenues, as evidenced by the ongoing dependence on weather conditions for demand, particularly during the heating season. These changes reflect a strategic evolution in managing consumption variability through regulatory tools.",

The settlement agreement provides for (i) a $1 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues and a refund to customers of approximately $4 million, (ii) a rate escalation of 2.5% on an annual basis in periods subsequent to December 31, 2024 and continuing through the end of the SSA on December 31, 2035, and (iii) a waiver of rights by Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy to file for any changes in non-fuel rates through the end of the term of the SSA. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\n## Utility Regulation and Rate Design\n\nThe natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.\n\nAs a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed charges when billing their respective customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fix ed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta G as Light's revenues since the monthly fix ed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas has various mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit ex posure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.\n\nIn addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fix ed customer service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. With the exception of Chattanooga Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. See \"Rate Proceedings\" herein for additional information. Also see \"Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" herein for additional information regarding infrastructure replacement programs at certain of the natural gas distribution utilities.\n\nThe following table provides regulatory information for Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

By 2023, Southern Company had transitioned to a more active compliance posture, particularly through Georgia Power, which submitted notices of planned participation (NOPP) to retire Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs) and pursue compliance for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 through the voluntary incentive program by December 31, 2028.

Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs, associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order). Under the Environmental Accounting Order, the regulatory asset would be amortized and recovered over an affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP Compliance\" and \" - Environmental Accounting Order\" for additional information.\n\nGeorgia Power submitted its NOPP to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) indicating plans to retire Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to pursue compliance with the ELG Reconsideration Rule for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership) through the voluntary incentive program by no later than December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to comply with the ELG Rules for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 through the generally applicable requirements by December 31, 2025; therefore, no NOPP submission was required for these units. The NOPP submittals and generally applicable requirements are subject to the review of the Georgia EPD.\n\nThe units for which Georgia Power has indicated early retirement plans have net book values totaling approximately $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through the ECCR tariff) at December 31, 2021. A final decision regarding the future operation of Georgia Power's impacted units and the timing of any retirements are subject to review by the Georgia PSC as a part of Georgia Power's 2022 IRP proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plan\" for additional information.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\nThe ELG Reconsideration Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs for the traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. However, the ultimate impact of the ELG Reconsideration Rule will depend on the Southern Company system's final assessment of compliance options, the incorporation of these assessments into each of the traditional electric operating company's IRP process, the incorporation of these new requirements into each plant's NPDES permit, and the outcome of legal challenges. The ELG Reconsideration Rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The case is being held in abeyance while the EPA undertakes a new rulemaking to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule. A proposed rule is expected in the fall of 2022. Any revisions could require changes in the traditional electric operating companies' compliance strategies.\n\n## Coal Combustion Residuals\n\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the management and disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. In addition to the federal CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the management and disposal of CCR within their respective states. In 2019, the State of Georgia received partial approval from the EPA for its state CCR permitting program. The State of Mississippi has not developed a state CCR permit program.\n\nThe Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule, finalized in August 2020, revised the deadline to stop sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to unlined surface impoundments to April 11, 2021 and established a process for the EPA to approve extensions to the deadline. The traditional electric operating companies stopped sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to their unlined impoundments prior to April 11, 2021 and, therefore, did not submit requests for extensions. On January 11, 2022, the EPA proposed determinations on deadline extension requests for other non-affiliated facilities, which reflected its positions on a variety of CCR Rule compliance requirements including closure standards, groundwater monitoring, and corrective action. The traditional electric operating companies are in the process of reviewing these determinations to determine how the EPA's current positions may",

      "answer": "In 2023, NEE valued forward contracts - power using discounted cash flow with a weighted-average forward price of $49 per MWh, resulting in a fair value of $500 million in assets and $470 million in liabilities. By 2024, the weighted-average forward price increased to $52 per MWh, yet the fair value of forward contracts - power decreased to $423 million in assets and $401 million in liabilities. This indicates that while the per-unit pricing increased slightly, broader market or volume adjustments likely contributed to a lower overall fair value of the contracts.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2022 impairment charge of $131 million related to asset divestitures influence its strategic focus on distributed energy solutions through PowerSecure in 2024, particularly in light of the adoption of ASU 2023-07 and the reclassification of these offerings as a distinct segment in financial reporting?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company recorded a $131 million pre-tax impairment charge related to the divestiture of natural gas storage facilities, signaling a strategic shift away from certain traditional energy assets. This reallocation of resources aligned with its acquisition of PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions, including microgrid deployments for commercial and industrial customers. By 2024, the company formally recognized distributed energy solutions as a distinct component of its operations, as noted in the segment reporting adjustments following the adoption of ASU 2023-07. This standard required enhanced transparency around performance metrics, and the inclusion of distributed energy under 'All Other' demonstrates a deliberate pivot toward modernized, customer-focused energy offerings, leveraging the capabilities gained through PowerSecure to support long-term strategic realignment.",

See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under \"Southern Company Gas\" and \"Southern Company Leveraged Lease,\" respectively, and Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" for information regarding impairment charges recorded during the periods presented.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities\n\nSouthern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas each evaluated its goodwill in the fourth quarter 2021 and determined no impairment was required. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" for information regarding impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in 2019.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, goodwill was as follows:\n\n",

The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (SO) disclosed its consolidated financing arrangements, including those for its gas subsidiaries (SO_10k_2022.pdf:page_193:chunk_2). By 2023, Nicor Gas operated under a separate financing structure without credit support from affiliates and was restricted up to $1.7 billion in retained earnings from making dividends or loans to affiliates (SO_10k_2023.pdf:page_107:chunk_1). This restriction limited Nicor Gas\u2019 financial flexibility, directly contributing to a $96 million pre-tax charge from disallowed capital investments that it could not offset through intercompany support or retained earnings (SO_10k_2023.pdf:page_302:chunk_5). Unlike other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries that benefit from shared commercial paper programs, Nicor Gas had to rely solely on its own financing mechanisms, making it more vulnerable to regulatory disallowances.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Progress acquired storm recovery property in North Carolina, which was financed through the issuance of $770 million in senior secured bonds via its subsidiary DEPNCSF. This earlier acquisition model, based on North Carolina storm costs from 2018\u20132019, laid the groundwork for a similar approach in South Carolina. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress extended this model by forming DEPSC SF, which issued $177 million in senior secured bonds to recover storm costs incurred from 2014 through 2022. The evolution from 2022 to 2024 shows a geographic expansion of the storm recovery financing mechanism into South Carolina, using a structurally consistent VIE model with non-bypassable customer charges as the sole repayment source.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nGain on dispositions, net increased $105 million in 2021 compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net decreased $94 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes increased $102 million, or 59.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to $114 million in additional tax expense resulting from the sale of Sequent, including changes in state tax apportionment rates, and higher pre-tax earnings at the natural gas distribution utilities, partially offset by $18 million of tax benefit resulting from the PennEast Pipeline project impairment charges in the second and third quarters of 2021. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Other Business Activities\n\nSouthern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How did the change in NextEra Energy Partners' (NEP) wind project portfolio between 2022 and 2024 influence NEE's equity earnings from its stake in NEP and its direct investments in wind projects in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a noncontrolling stake in NEP, which owned or had interests in a portfolio of wind, solar, and solar plus battery storage projects, generating stable long-term cash flows. By 2024, NEE reported increased earnings from new wind and solar generation and battery storage facilities that entered service since 2023, indicating growth in its direct investments in wind projects. However, NEE\u2019s equity earnings from NEP declined significantly, with NEER recognizing $267 million in equity losses from equity method investees in 2024, compared to $649 million in losses in 2023, largely due to a $0.8 billion impairment charge in 2024. This suggests that while NEE\u2019s direct investments in wind projects contributed positively to revenue, its stake in NEP was negatively impacted by asset impairments, reflecting a shift in how NEE\u2019s wind energy growth was structured and performed across its investment vehicles.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 NEP: NEE held a noncontrolling interest in NEP, which owned wind and solar projects with stable cash flows.",

        "Hop 3: Wind Projects \u2190 NEE(2024): NEE directly invested in new wind projects that entered service post-2023, contributing to increased operating revenues in 2024."

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

      "question": "How did NEE's shift from equity method earnings through its stake in NEP in 2022 to direct investments in solar projects by 2024 impact its consolidated earnings and strategic positioning in clean energy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a noncontrolling interest in NEP, which owned a portfolio of solar and wind projects, and reported earnings through equity method investees. By 2024, NEE transitioned toward direct investments in solar generation and battery storage facilities, which contributed to a $494 million increase in operating revenues from new investments. However, equity in losses from equity method investees rose from $649 million in 2023 to $267 million in 2024, indicating a strategic pivot away from passive ownership in NEP-like entities toward active ownership of new solar assets. This shift likely reflects a broader strategic realignment to capitalize on growth in renewable energy markets directly, despite a $0.8 billion pre-tax impairment charge in 2024.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements.

However, despite this operational consistency, Southern Company reported a pre-tax charge of $96 million ($72 million after tax) in 2023 due to the disallowance of certain capital investments at Nicor Gas. This suggests that while the utility maintained its physical and customer footprint, regulatory decisions negatively impacted the financial treatment of capital expenditures, highlighting a disconnect between operational performance and regulatory approval of investment recovery.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company conducted a quantitative assessment for PowerSecure, which revealed that its fair value was lower than its carrying amount due to declining macroeconomic conditions, resulting in a $119 million goodwill impairment. In contrast, by 2023, PowerSecure\u2019s fair value exceeded its carrying amount during the quantitative assessment, indicating an improvement in its financial outlook. This evolution suggests that Southern Company's impairment testing process through the quantitative assessment directly influenced the recognition of impairment losses, with 2022 showing a significant impairment and 2023 showing recovery.",

The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur, including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.\n\nAs part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value.\n\nGoodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021.

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power had a $42 million capacity purchase commitment tied to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, which were subject to a first priority lien securing DOE loan guarantees. This lien also extended to Georgia Power\u2019s rights and obligations for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2023, Nicor Gas faced a $96 million pre-tax charge due to disallowed capital investments, which were likely constrained by the financial obligations tied to secured liabilities like the Vogtle-related liens. The lien on Nicor Gas\u2019 properties limited financial flexibility, contributing to the impact of regulatory disallowances on the company\u2019s gas distribution segment.",

See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner holding the same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 76,289 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.",

      "answer": "In 2021, DEPNCSF issued $770 million in senior secured bonds to finance unrecovered regulatory assets related to North Carolina storm costs from 2018 and 2019, with collections from non-bypassable charges serving as the sole source of repayment. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress had consolidated DEPNCSF, indicating ongoing responsibility for those obligations while also forming DEPSCSF to issue an additional $177 million in bonds for South Carolina storm costs spanning 2014 to 2022. This shows a strategic expansion of the storm recovery financing model both geographically and temporally, while maintaining the same financial structure of special purpose entities and non-recourse debt.",

      "question": "How did the change in Nicor Gas' LIFO inventory valuation from 2022 to 2023 affect Southern Company's financial exposure, particularly in light of the $96 million pre-tax charge associated with Nicor Gas in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Nicor Gas' LIFO inventory balance was $166 million, with an estimated replacement cost of $470 million, indicating a significant gap between book value and current market value. By 2023, the LIFO inventory balance increased to $186 million, while the estimated replacement cost dropped sharply to $268 million. This narrowing of the replacement cost gap suggests a reduction in inflationary pressure or a decline in natural gas prices. Despite this, Southern Company recorded a $96 million pre-tax charge in 2023 related to Nicor Gas, likely due to disallowance of certain capital investments. The continued use of LIFO suggests that inventory valuation method was not the source of the charge; instead, regulatory decisions or asset write-downs likely drove the financial impact, even as inventory costs stabilized.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 LIFO Basis: Nicor Gas used LIFO for inventory valuation, with a balance of $166 million and replacement cost of $470 million in 2022",

Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes propane gas inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies. Materials and supplies for Southern Power generally includes the average cost of generating plant materials.\n\nMaterials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.\n\n## Fuel Inventory\n\nFuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and emissions allowances. Fuel inventory for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil, natural gas, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost, as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric operating companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.\n\n## Natural Gas for Sale\n\nWith the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. In Georgia's deregulated, competitive environment, Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a monthly basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract, along with a corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets and related natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.\n\nNicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted for differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income. At December 31, 2021, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was $166 million. Based on the average cost of gas purchased in December 2021, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at December 31, 2021 was $470 million.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE's pension plan allocated 10% of its assets to convertible securities, indicating a relatively higher appetite for growth-oriented, hybrid instruments that offer both equity and fixed-income features. By 2024, this allocation dropped to 5%, with the remaining capital reallocated primarily to alternative investments (increasing from 13% to 20%). This shift suggests a strategic move toward more stable, diversified, and potentially lower-volatility asset classes, aligning with the pension plan\u2019s objective of protecting funded status and reducing reliance on employer contributions. The reduction in convertible securities, which are more volatile than fixed income but less so than equities, reflects a more conservative risk posture by NEE in managing its pension liabilities over time.",

        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 Convertible Securities: NEE's pension plan had a 10% allocation to convertible securities as part of its broader investment strategy emphasizing diversification and return.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas had a significant ownership stake of 87.27% in a facility jointly owned with NCEMC, indicating a strong but not exclusive control. By 2024, DUK (through Duke Energy Progress) proposed a new hydrogen-capable combined-cycle (CC) facility at the Roxboro site, with a co-ownership structure where DUK would own approximately 1,135 MW and NCEMC would own 225 MW of the 1,360 MW facility. This represents a strategic shift from prior arrangements, where NCEMC played a more passive role, to a more balanced co-ownership model in 2024. The evolution shows DUK's increased collaboration with NCEMC, likely to align with regulatory, environmental, and cost recovery strategies as coal-fired units 1 and 4 at Roxboro were slated for retirement.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Ohio had $25 million in commercial paper outstanding, which remained unchanged in 2023. Despite stable commercial paper levels, Duke Energy Ohio's total debt (including tax-exempt bonds) remained at $52 million in both years. This suggests that the company maintained a consistent short-term financing approach in Ohio, relying minimally on commercial paper relative to other funding instruments like tax-exempt bonds. The lack of change in commercial paper usage indicates a stable liquidity strategy for operations in Ohio during this period.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Progress (DEP) used DEPNC SF to secure $770 million in storm recovery bonds issued in 2021, which were backed by storm recovery property created to finance unrecovered costs from storms in 2018 and 2019. By 2024, DEP expanded its storm cost financing strategy by forming a new entity, DEPSC SF, which issued $177 million in bonds to recover storm costs incurred from 2014 through 2022. DEPNC SF continued to play a key role in 2024 as a consolidated VIE, with its storm recovery property still serving as the sole source of funds for debt repayment. This evolution reflects a broadening of the financing scope both temporally (covering a longer historical period of storm costs) and geographically (now including South Carolina), while maintaining the same legal and financial structure anchored by the storm recovery property mechanism.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program consisting of 10 new solar facilities totaling approximately 750 MW of capacity, with an estimated investment of $1 billion over three years. These facilities were designed to be funded through subscription fees and included in base rates, with bill credits tied to actual generation. By 2024, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida had entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) that were classified as both finance and operating leases, indicating a strategic shift toward leveraging structured financing mechanisms to support renewable energy development. The 2022 investment in solar infrastructure laid the groundwork for the 2024 adoption of PPAs, which allowed Duke to manage capital exposure while expanding clean energy capacity. This reflects a deliberate evolution in how Duke financed and operated its solar assets over time.",

The FPSC also approved allowing Duke Energy Florida to use the tax savings resulting from the Tax Act to recover these storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge. Approved storm costs were fully recovered by year-end 2021. On November 22, 2019, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition for approval of actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael in the amount of $191 million plus interest. On May 19, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a supplemental true up reducing the actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael by approximately $3 million, resulting in a total request to recover $188 million actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs, plus interest. Approximately $80 million of these costs are included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.\n\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on December 19, 2019, to recover $169 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Dorian, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement and the FPSC approved the petition on February 24, 2020. The final actual amount of $145 million was filed on September 30, 2020. The 2021 Settlement resolved all matters regarding storm cost recovery relating to Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\n\n## Clean Energy Connection\n\nOn July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program. The program consists of 10 new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately 750 MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt-subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the 10 new solar generation facilities is approximately $1 billion over the next three years, and this investment will be included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees. The credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC's order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. LULAC's initial brief was filed on May 26, 2021, and Appellees' response briefs were filed on July 26, 2021.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy was subject to FERC regulations that governed KO Transmission\u2019s interstate pipeline operations, including its 90-mile natural gas pipeline supplying Duke Energy Ohio. In February 2023, KO Transmission sold all of its pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC for approximately book value. This divestiture marked a strategic shift for Duke Energy Ohio, reducing its direct involvement in natural gas transportation infrastructure while remaining under FERC oversight.

The PTCs, with $0.8 billion unutilized at the end of 2021 and expected to be fully utilized by 2024, provided a financial advantage that likely enabled Southern Power to structure stable, long-term contracts. In 2023, Southern Company disclosed that Southern Power's power sales agreements (PPAs) were a core component of its revenue model, indicating that the PTC benefits from earlier years contributed to revenue stability through these agreements.

      "question": "Given Southern Company's increased reliance on nuclear generation from 2022 to 2023, how has their exposure to environmental risks changed, and what additional financial safeguards might be necessary given the potential for damages exceeding decommissioning trusts or insurance coverage?",
      "answer": "In 2022, nuclear units represented approximately 26% and 28% of total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. By 2023, this increased slightly to 27% and 29%, indicating a growing reliance on nuclear generation. As nuclear operations are subject to environmental risks such as radioactive material releases and decommissioning uncertainties, this increased reliance translates into heightened exposure to such risks. The 2023 filing notes that damages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance. Therefore, Southern Company may need to consider additional financial safeguards, such as increasing capital reserves for decommissioning or securing supplemental insurance coverage, to address the potential liabilities associated with their increased exposure to environmental risks.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Nuclear Power Plants: Nuclear units represented 26% and 28% of total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

By 2024, Georgia Power\u2019s financial statements reflected the impact of rate regulation on multiple line items, including regulatory assets and liabilities, as detailed in Note 2. The Commission\u2019s decisions on rate recovery influenced Georgia Power\u2019s ability to realize returns on investments and recover prudently incurred costs, which were material disclosures in the financial statements.

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nGeorgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the G eorgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation may impact multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.",

      "question": "How did the change in Duke Energy's storm recovery property financing through storm recovery bonds evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to managing unrecovered regulatory assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress transferred storm recovery property to their special purpose subsidiaries, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF, which issued $237 million and $770 million in senior secured bonds, respectively. These bonds were used to finance unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. In 2023, the structure remained consistent, with the storm recovery bonds still secured by the storm recovery property and collections from non-bypassable customer charges. The continued use of this financing mechanism indicates a stable and deliberate strategy by Duke Energy to manage long-term storm-related costs without direct recourse to the parent companies. The bond amounts remained unchanged year-over-year, suggesting that the initial financing was sufficient to cover the targeted regulatory assets.",

(DECNCSF) and Duke Energy Progress NC Storm Funding, LLC. (DEPNCSF) are bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\n\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $237 million and $770 million of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The storm recovery property was created by state legislation and NCUC financing orders for the purpose of financing storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. The storm recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from all Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The storm recovery bonds are secured by the storm recovery property and cash collections from the storm recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress. For additional information, see Notes 3 and 6.\n\nDECNCSF and DEPNCSF are considered VIEs primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIEs as described above and therefore Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DECNCSF and DEPNCSF, respectively.\n\nThe following table summarizes the impact of these VIEs on Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company (through Alabama Power) had a stake in PowerSouth and began delivering 100 MWs of year-round capacity service to PowerSouth starting February 1, 2024. This deepened relationship under the coordinated planning and operations agreement created cost savings and reliability improvements but also increased Southern Company\u2019s exposure to electricity market volatility. By 2024, this exposure was managed in part through energy-related derivative contracts, where gains and losses from fuel-hedging programs were deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. The 100 MW capacity service increase directly tied Southern Company more closely to PowerSouth\u2019s load fluctuations, necessitating greater use of derivatives to hedge fuel and energy price risks, as evidenced by the regulatory hedge accounting treatment detailed in the 2024 filings.",

When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its ex posure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:\n\n",

By 2024, this led to the formalization of the Bad Debt Rider policy, which allowed Nicor Gas to recover or refund the difference between actual bad debt experience and the benchmark used in base rates.

The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

If circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.\n\nCredit risk ex posure at Nicor G as is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 14 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk ex posure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest ex posure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit ex posure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, and interest rates. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets (included in \"Other\" or shown separately as \"Risk Management Activities\") and are measured at fair value. See Note 13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and Southern Company Gas' bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are ex cluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the \"normal\" scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.\n\nThe Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.\n\nSouthern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nThe purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed concerns about the risk of non-recovery of costs, particularly emphasizing uncertainties around the Georgia Public Service Commission's (GPSC) future decisions on cost recovery for its regulated utility subsidiaries, including Georgia Power, which represented approximately 88% of Southern Company's consolidated operating revenues in 2021. By 2024, Georgia Power's financial statements continued to reflect the impact of these regulatory risks, with specific disclosures in Note 1 and Note 2 of its 10-K filing showing that the GPSC still had not guaranteed full recovery of prudently incurred costs or a reasonable return on investment. This indicates that the core regulatory risk identified in 2022 persisted into 2024, with no significant resolution of cost recovery uncertainties, and continued to influence Georgia Power's regulatory asset and liability balances.",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nSouthern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities (the \"regulated utility subsidiaries\"), which represent approximately 88% of Southern Company's consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 86% of its consolidated total assets at December 31, 2021, are subject to rate regulation by their respective state Public Service Commissions or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that the regulated utility subsidiaries meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the regulated utility subsidiaries, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of G eorgia Power as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of ex pressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Florida petitioned for approval of a $1 billion investment in 10 new solar facilities with 750 MW of combined capacity, which was approved by the FPSC in January 2021 and remained in effect pending appeal through 2022. This investment laid the foundation for increased reliance on renewable energy infrastructure, which directly influenced the company's engagement with PPAs. As seen in 2023, Duke Energy Progress and Florida had entered into PPAs classified as both finance and operating leases, indicating a strategic shift toward long-term contractual commitments tied to renewable generation. Additionally, the 2023 disclosures show that variable lease payments under PPAs were not included in the measurement of ROU assets or lease liabilities, suggesting a financial structuring approach to manage the cost recovery and risk associated with the earlier solar investments. This evolution shows a clear progression from capital investment in solar infrastructure to structured contractual arrangements for its operation and financial treatment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Storm Restoration Cost Recovery\n\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on April 30, 2019, to recover $223 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Michael, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement, and the FPSC approved the petition on June 11, 2019. The FPSC also approved allowing Duke Energy Florida to use the tax savings resulting from the Tax Act to recover these storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge. Approved storm costs were fully recovered by year-end 2021. On November 22, 2019, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition for approval of actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael in the amount of $191 million plus interest. On May 19, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a supplemental true up reducing the actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael by approximately $3 million, resulting in a total request to recover $188 million actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs, plus interest. Approximately $80 million of these costs are included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.\n\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on December 19, 2019, to recover $169 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Dorian, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement and the FPSC approved the petition on February 24, 2020. The final actual amount of $145 million was filed on September 30, 2020. The 2021 Settlement resolved all matters regarding storm cost recovery relating to Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\n\n## Clean Energy Connection\n\nOn July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program. The program consists of 10 new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately 750 MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt-subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the 10 new solar generation facilities is approximately $1 billion over the next three years, and this investment will be included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees. The credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC's order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. LULAC's initial brief was filed on May 26, 2021, and Appellees' response briefs were filed on July 26, 2021. LULAC's reply brief was filed on September 24, 2021, and its request for oral argument was filed on September 28, 2021. The Supreme Court of Florida heard the oral argument on February 9, 2022. The FPSC approval order remains in effect pending the outcome of the appeal. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas used energy-related derivatives under regulatory hedges to manage fuel price volatility, with unrealized derivative gains (losses) deferred and later included in fuel expenses as the fuel was used. By 2024, the company maintained a similar approach, with substantially all energy-related derivatives still designated as regulatory hedges. However, the context in 2024 emphasized the continued use of these instruments to manage fuel-hedging programs, indicating a stable strategy but with an explicit note that these contracts remained critical in mitigating price volatility, especially given Southern Company Gas's retained exposure to energy price fluctuations. This suggests that while the regulatory hedge mechanism remained consistent, the ongoing emphasis on these derivatives in 2024 highlights a strategic reinforcement of risk management in response to potentially increased market volatility.",

See Note 1 under \"Financial Instruments\" for additional information. See Note 15 under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\n## Energy-Related Derivatives\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their longterm sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.\n\nEnergy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:\n\n- Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.\n- Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.\n- Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.\n\nSome energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.",

Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations betw een S outhern Company G as Capital and Nicor G as may be adjusted. Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fix ed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the nex t 12 months.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (SO) had a declining investment in SNG, with amounts of $127 million in 2020 and $129 million in 2019, indicating a relatively minor but consistent stake. By 2024, SNG had introduced a major $3 billion pipeline project aimed at increasing its pipeline capacity by 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. SO disclosed that its subsidiary, Southern Company Gas, would own 50% of the project, signaling a significant capital commitment despite the earlier modest investment levels.

See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under \"Southern Company Gas\" and \"Southern Company Leveraged Lease,\" respectively, and Note 15 under \"Southern Company\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" for information regarding impairment charges recorded during the periods presented.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities\n\nSouthern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective PPA.

In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas each evaluated its goodwill in the fourth quarter 2021 and determined no impairment was required.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plants Hatch and Vogtle. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in an HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment ex penses, other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, previous annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively for the interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 16 for additional information and related disclosures.\n\n## Affiliate Transactions\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general ex ecutive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern",

      "question": "How did the change in fair value of NextEra Energy's full requirements and unit contingent contracts from 2023 to 2024 reflect the impact of using discounted cash flow valuation techniques on their forward price assumptions per MWh?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the fair value of NextEra Energy's full requirements and unit contingent contracts was $674 million in assets and $146 million in liabilities, with a weighted-average forward price of $67 per MWh. By 2024, the fair value of these contracts had decreased to $209 million in assets and $203 million in liabilities, with the weighted-average forward price increasing to $76 per MWh. This shift indicates that the discounted cash flow valuation technique, which was consistently applied across both years, factored in higher forward price assumptions in 2024 despite the overall decline in asset valuation. The range of forward prices also widened from $(2) to $340 per MWh in 2023 to $20 to $297 per MWh in 2024, suggesting increased variability in expected future cash flows under the same valuation framework.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SO's subsidiary Southern Power had a stake in the Glass Sands wind facility with an approximate nameplate capacity of 118 MW, indicating partial or shared control. By 2024, the filing clarified that Southern Power now owns 100% of Glass Sands, consolidating full control over the facility. This shift from a shared or partial stake to full ownership suggests a strategic move to increase control over wind energy assets, likely to enhance long-term stability, improve operational integration, and secure revenue streams from a key renewable energy project.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Wind: SO's 2022 10-K shows that the Glass Sands facility, a wind project, had an approximate nameplate capacity of 118 MW and was completed in November 2021, indicating SO's involvement but not full ownership.",
        "Hop 2: Wind \u2192 Glass Sands: Glass Sands is specifically identified in both filings as a wind energy facility in which SO's subsidiary Southern Power holds a stake.",
        "Hop 3: Glass Sands \u2190 SO(2024): The 2024 10-K explicitly states that Southern Power owns 100% of Glass Sands, showing a shift from the earlier partial or shared stake implied in 2022."

      "answer": "Southern Company's financial stake in Chattanooga Gas in 2024 was $7 million, as stated in SO_10k_2024.pdf, remaining unchanged from 2023. Prior to 2022, Sequent had a direct contractual relationship with Chattanooga Gas under asset management agreements, which were explicitly stated in SO_10k_2022.pdf to remain in place until March 31, 2025, even after Sequent's sale on July 1, 2021. This reveals that despite divesting Sequent, Southern Company maintained a limited but continuing financial and contractual linkage with Chattanooga Gas through the preserved agreements, though the $7 million stake suggests a minimal ongoing equity position relative to Chattanooga Gas\u2019s overall capital structure.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions, Net\n\nIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Earnings from Equity Method Investments\n\nIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.",

Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATION - \"Southern Company - Electricity Business - Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses\" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATION under \"Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses\" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2020 and 2021.\n\nSCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2022, SCS has contracted for 517 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 12 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their 2022 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications, emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plan\" and \"Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 13 years. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units. Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\nChanges in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See \"Rate Matters - Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans\" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nAdvances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and lower prices for natural gas, which fluctuate over time. Demand increases in 2021 resulted in price increases and high volatility; however, absent unforeseen developments, forward prices are expected to decline over the next several years. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, from Sequent, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Despite the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, the Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas asset management agreements with Sequent remain in place and will expire on March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2025, respectively. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas",

      "answer": "SO's 72 MW Tranquillity Solar Storage project, completed between November 2021 and March 2022, marked their early engagement with battery energy storage systems in Fresno County, CA. By 2024, this experience appears to have informed the company's approach to larger-scale projects like the 150 MW South Cheyenne Solar Storage in Wyoming (COD April 2024) and the 512 MW Millers Branch Solar complex in Texas (spanning three phases with CODs between 2025 and 2026). The increased capacity and extended planning horizon suggest that lessons learned from Tranquillity's implementation and operations likely contributed to more ambitious project designs and longer-term contracting strategies, as evidenced by the 20-year PPA for Millers Branch Phase I.",

      "question": "How did NextEra Energy's (NEE) stake in NEP in 2022 influence the allocation of capital toward battery storage projects in NEE's 2023 capital expenditure plans, particularly given NEP's ownership of 10,118 MW in contracted renewable energy assets, including battery storage?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a significant stake in NEP, which owns a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets, including wind, solar, and battery storage projects totaling 10,118 MW as of December 31, 2023. This stake positioned NEE to influence and benefit from NEP\u2019s strategic development of battery storage, a key component of its clean energy portfolio. By 2023, NEE\u2019s capital expenditure plans specifically included a significant allocation for battery storage projects, as noted in the 2023 10-K filing under capital expenditures categorized under 'battery storage and renewable fuels projects.' This reflects a direct alignment between NEE\u2019s investment in NEP and its broader capital strategy to expand in high-growth clean energy segments like battery storage, which enhances the value and reliability of its renewable assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE(2022) \u2192 NEP: NEE had a stake in NEP in 2022, which included convertible notes and potential equity dilution.",
        "Hop 2: NEP \u2192 Battery Storage Projects: NEP owned or had partial ownership in a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets totaling 10,118 MW, including wind, solar, and battery storage projects as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Battery Storage Projects \u2190 NEE(2023): NEE's 2023 capital expenditure plans included specific allocations for battery storage projects, indicating strategic alignment with NEP\u2019s portfolio."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAtlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC.\n\nSee \"Rate Proceedings - Atlanta Gas Light\" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 18, 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024.\n\n## Chattanooga Gas\n\nIn June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.\n\n## Natural Gas Cost Recovery\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, the over recovered balance was $88 million, which was included in other regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.\n\n## Rate Proceedings\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.\n\nIn July 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of $37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PowerSecure experienced a goodwill impairment of $119 million due to declining macroeconomic conditions that reduced sales growth and estimated cash flows. This indicated financial stress and a downward revision of expectations for PowerSecure\u2019s performance at that time. However, by 2024, PowerSecure\u2019s core activity\u2014developing distributed energy and resilience solutions\u2014was explicitly called out in Southern Company\u2019s segment reporting as a distinct and strategic business function within the 'All Other' category. This suggests that despite earlier impairment, Southern Company continued to invest in and strategically position PowerSecure\u2019s distributed energy solutions, elevating its visibility in financial disclosures by 2024 as part of a broader resilience and energy transition strategy.",

BUSINESS\n\nSouthern Company is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and Southern Company Gas.\n\n- The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are each operating public utility companies providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.\n- Southern Power Company is also an operating public utility company. The term \"Southern Power\" when used herein refers to Southern Power Company and its subsidiaries, while the term \"Southern Power Company\" when used herein refers only to the Southern Power parent company. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, operates, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.\n- Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas in four states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee - through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas.\n\nSouthern Company also owns SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SCS, the system service company, has contracted with Southern Company, each of the Subsidiary Registrants, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO, and other subsidiaries to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon request, the following services: general executive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax , information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern Company power pool transactions. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services through its subsidiary, Southern Telecom, Inc. Southern Linc's system covers approximately 122,000 square miles in the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary, which invests in various projects. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.\n\nSee \"The Southern Company System\" herein for additional information. Also see Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding recent acquisition and disposition activity. Segment information for the Registrants is included in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each operate with one reportable business segment, since substantially all of their business is providing electric service to customers. Southern Power also operates its business with one reportable business segment, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market.\n\nThe Registrants' Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are made available on Southern Company's website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Southern Company's internet address is www.southerncompany.com.\n\n## The Southern Company System\n\n## Traditional Electric Operating Companies\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the state of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see \"Territory Served by the Southern Company System - Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power\" herein.\n\nAgreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Development Projects\n\nIn November 2024, Southern Power committed to a development project to repower 200 MWs of the 299-MW Kay Wind facility located in Kay County, Oklahoma. The output of the project is contracted under an amended 20-year PPA with commercial operation projected to occur in the third quarter 2026.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California facility was completed in September 2023. Both sales resulted in an immaterial loss. Completion of the sale of the Tex as facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was executed in October 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2022.\n\nNeither of these dispositions, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for Southern Company Gas that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales were classified as discontinued operations for the applicable periods presented.\n\n## 16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\n\nThe Registrants adopted ASU 2023-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. See Note 1 under \"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for additional information.\n\nThe CODM at Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas is the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of such Registrant. Southern Power's CODM consists of the chairman and chief executive officer and the president. The CODMs assess segment performance using net income that is reflected on the Registrants' respective statements of income as net income attributable to the registrant, net income after dividends on preferred stock, or net income, as applicable. The CODMs use net income in the annual budget and forecasting process and consider budget versus actual results on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of resources. Unless noted below, the CODMs do not utilize segment asset information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSouthern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. While the traditional electric operating companies represent three separate operating segments, they are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers, in the Southeast and have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $371 million, $537 million, and $875 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The \"All Other\" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.\n\nSouthern Company's CODM utilizes segment net income, including variances to budget and forecasts, to assess performance and is not provided with segment expense information. To achieve the consolidated net income goal, Southern Company's CODM sets net income expectations for each operating segment, which is expected to monitor its expenses in order to achieve its assigned net income target. Therefore, Southern Company has no reportable significant segment expenses.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's cost recovery strategy for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2023 align with the stakeholder composition among the Vogtle Owners in 2024, particularly in terms of capital cost allocation and operational responsibilities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company, through Georgia Power, sought recovery of $8.826 billion in total construction and capital costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with $7.562 billion ultimately approved under the Prudency Stipulation, including $1.02 billion in retail rate base items. These units are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners\u2014Georgia Power, OPC, MEAG Power, and Dalton\u2014as noted in the 2024 filing. The 2023 evidence indicates that each owner holds undivided interests similar to those in Units 1 and 2, implying shared operational and financial responsibilities. By 2024, the defined ownership group suggests a coordinated cost and risk-sharing framework, aligning with the earlier cost recovery strategy. This shows a deliberate alignment between financial planning in 2023 and stakeholder structure in 2024 to manage large-scale nuclear plant operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: Discloses $8.826 billion in construction and capital costs, with $7.562 billion approved for recovery.",
        "Hop 2: Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 \u2192 Vogtle Owners: Joint ownership structure implies shared financial and operational responsibilities.",
        "Hop 3: Vogtle Owners \u2190 SO(2024): 2024 filing confirms the specific owners (Georgia Power, OPC, MEAG Power, and Dalton), indicating a stable and coordinated stakeholder alignment."

      "question": "How did NEE's capital allocation strategy toward solar projects evolve between 2022 and 2023, given its stake in NEP and NEP's ownership of clean energy assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a noncontrolling interest in NEP, which owned or had stakes in a portfolio of wind, solar, and solar plus battery storage projects, with stable long-term cash flows (Hop2 Evidence). By 2023, NEE disclosed capital expenditure plans that included $6,134 MW of new solar projects (including solar plus battery storage) and related transmission, signaling a significant strategic push into solar energy (Hop3 Evidence). This evolution suggests that NEE, despite maintaining its equity method investment in NEP, increased its direct capital commitment to solar infrastructure, likely leveraging NEP\u2019s existing clean energy asset base to scale up solar deployment. The shift indicates a more aggressive investment stance in solar projects year-over-year.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation - The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes. On January 1, 2021, FPL and Gulf Power Company merged, with FPL as the surviving entity. However during 2021, FPL continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities  in  the  former  service  areas  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power.  The  FPL  segment  (FPL,  excluding  Gulf  Power,  related  purchase  accounting adjustments and eliminating entries) and the Gulf Power segment (Gulf Power) continued to be operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE (see Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). The merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company was a merger between entities under common control, which required it to be accounted for as if the merger occurred since the inception of common control, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, FPL's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results and financial position of the common control merger prior to the merger date. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company.\n\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than 5.7 million customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and eight counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through  both  controlled  and  consolidated  entities  and  noncontrolling  ownership  interests  in  joint  ventures.  NEER  participates  in  natural  gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  or  noncontrolling  or  joint  venture  interests.  NEER  also  invests  in  rate-regulated  transmission  facilities  and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain  amounts  included  in  prior  years'  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nNEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP owns or has an ownership interest in a portfolio of wind, solar and solar plus battery storage projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEE owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP and accounts for its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accounts for NextEra Energy Resources' project sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER operates  essentially  all  of  the  energy  projects  owned  by  NEP  and  provide  services  to  NEP  under  various  related  party  operations  and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements.\n\nOperating Revenues - FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's  consolidated  statements  of  income  and  were  approximately  $852  million,  $800  million  and  $838  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company was subject to dividend restrictions tied to Nicor Gas, which limited Nicor Gas' ability to pay dividends or make loans to affiliates due to regulatory constraints, with $1.3 billion in subsidiary retained earnings restricted for dividend payments. These restrictions likely constrained Southern Company's ability to draw capital from Nicor Gas, influencing its financial flexibility. In 2023, this relationship was negatively impacted further as Southern Company recorded a $96 million pre-tax charge due to the disallowance of certain capital investments at Nicor Gas, indicating that prior capital decisions were not recoverable, thereby worsening the financial strain. The chain shows a regulatory constraint in 2022 leading to a financial impairment in 2023, highlighting a deteriorating financial dynamic.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Nicor Gas operated its own commercial paper program to support working capital needs due to regulatory restrictions that prevented it from making money pool loans to affiliates. Southern Company Gas Capital similarly maintained a separate commercial paper program for the other subsidiaries. By 2024, Southern Company Gas expanded its committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 to include $700 million specifically allocated for Nicor Gas, restricted solely for its working capital needs, with the ability to adjust allocations between Nicor Gas and Southern Company Gas Capital. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward more structured, long-term financing for Nicor Gas, while maintaining the independence of its funding mechanisms.",

Nicor G as is also the borrow er under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. S ee \"S tructural Considerations\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than  /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 1\n\nThese bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Mississippi Power's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt ex cludes junior subordinated notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.\n\nA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At December 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at G eorgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power).

However, despite this reduction, SO maintained significant exposure to SNG through its 50% cost-sharing arrangement in a $3 billion pipeline project that remains subject to FERC approval and is scheduled for completion in 2029. This suggests that while SO decreased its direct investment in SNG during this period, it continued to support major regulated infrastructure projects through joint ventures, maintaining strategic exposure to growth opportunities in the natural gas sector under a shared risk framework.

Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans\" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates and additional capacity through its 2022 IRP and 2023 IRP Update sought through RFPs.\n\nSouthern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project and the Kay Wind repowering project. The Kay Wind repowering project results in accelerated depreciation related to the equipment being replaced that will continue until commercial operation of the project, which is projected to occur in the third quarter 2026. Pre-tax  accelerated depreciation, net of noncontrolling interest impacts, is projected to total approx imately $100 million in 2025 and $40 million in 2026. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.\n\nSouthern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flex ibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.\n\nSNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2029. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information on SNG.\n\nSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Cash Requirements - Capital Expenditures\" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.\n\n## Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Power has PPAs with certain of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.\n\nMany of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&amp;P, Fitch, or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Credit Rating Risk\" herein for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2024, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,014 MWs of annual natural gas and solar generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.",

On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Alabama Power will assume an existing power sales agreement under which the full output of the generating facility remains committed to a third party through April 2027. Upon expiration of the power sales agreement, Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with the Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC, as well as the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Renewable Generation Certificate\n\nThrough the issuance of a Renewable Generation Certificate (RGC), Alabama Power is authorized by the Alabama PSC to procure renewable capacity and energy and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. Under the original RGC, Alabama was authorized to procure up to 500 MWs of renewable capacity and energy. In June 2023, the Alabama PSC issued an order approving modifications to Alabama Power's RGC. The modifications authorized Alabama Power to procure an additional 2,400 MWs of renewable capacity and energy by June 14, 2029 and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. The modifications also increased the size of allowable renewable projects from 80 MWs to 200 MWs and increased the annual approval limit from 160 MWs to 400 MWs. Through December 31, 2024, Alabama Power has procured solar capacity totaling approximately 498 MWs under the RGC.\n\n## Rate RSE\n\nThe Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an \"A\" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey.\n\nAlabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 53.9% and 52.3%, respectively.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's nuclear units represented approximately 26% and 28% of total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. These nuclear facilities were explicitly called out in the 2022 10-K as being subject to cyber intrusion risks that could increase licensing or compliance costs. By 2023, the contribution of nuclear generation increased slightly to 27% and 29% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and the 10-K reiterated the exposure to cyber intrusion risks, particularly in the context of operational security and compliance. This indicates that as nuclear generation grew, so too did the company's exposure to cyber risks tied to these facilities, requiring heightened security measures and potentially increasing compliance costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.\n\nThe financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.\n\nOperation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.\n\nAlabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.\n\nDamages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.\n\nIn addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.\n\n## Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, SEGCO operated Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, with retirement expected by December 31, 2028. However, Alabama Power and Georgia Power were already evaluating an extension of Plant Gaston's operation beyond that date. By 2024, this evaluation culminated in a formal request in the 2025 IRP to extend Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. This strategic shift indicates that SEGCO's role evolved from managing an asset expected to retire in 2028 to supporting a longer-term operational plan, which likely involves additional capital investment and regulatory approvals. The financial implications include prolonged revenue generation from the plant and potential cost considerations related to maintenance, compliance, and asset life extension. This decision aligns with broader resource planning strategies reflected in Georgia Power's 2025 IRP, including the extension of other coal-fired units and investments in environmental controls.",

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's (SO) financial relationship with Nicor Gas in 2023, including the $96 million pre-tax charge for disallowed capital investments, influence its financing structure and disclosures in 2024, particularly regarding joint ownership and self-financing of infrastructure assets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company (SO) incurred a $96 million pre-tax charge due to the disallowance of certain capital investments at Nicor Gas, reflecting regulatory pushback and financial strain on this subsidiary. Nicor Gas, which operates with a separate financing structure without affiliate credit support, had restrictions on dividends and loans to affiliates, with $1.7 billion in retained earnings restricted at year-end. This limited internal financial flexibility likely shaped SO\u2019s broader financing strategy in 2024, where disclosures highlighted a continued reliance on joint ownership models (e.g., with FP&L and Williams Companies) and self-financing of infrastructure, such as the $26 million annual lease for the Dalton Pipeline. These 2024 disclosures suggest a strategic shift toward shared asset ownership and external financing arrangements to mitigate financial risk, especially in light of prior capital disallowances at Nicor Gas.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Nicor Gas: SO incurred a $96M pre-tax charge due to disallowed capital investments at Nicor Gas, indicating regulatory and financial challenges.",

        "Hop 3: Financing \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, SO disclosed increased reliance on joint ownership and self-financed infrastructure, such as the Dalton Pipeline lease, likely influenced by earlier financial constraints at Nicor Gas."

      "question": "How did NextEra Energy's (NEE) stake in NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) in 2022 influence the growth of solar project investments disclosed in 2023, and what does this indicate about NEE's strategic shift toward renewable energy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE held a significant stake in NEP, which issued $500 million in convertible notes, indicating strong financial backing and capital flexibility for NEP to acquire contracted clean energy assets. By 2023, NEP had ownership or partial ownership in a portfolio of renewable energy projects totaling approximately 10,118 MW, including solar, wind, and battery storage. Concurrently, NEE disclosed capital expenditures for new solar projects totaling approximately 6,134 MW in 2023, showing a direct link between NEE\u2019s financial strategy through NEP and its aggressive expansion in solar energy. This demonstrates a clear strategic evolution from 2022 to 2023, where NEE leveraged its stake in NEP to scale up solar investments and reinforce its leadership in renewable energy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nPotentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - NEP senior unsecured convertible notes, when outstanding, are potentially dilutive securities to NEE. In June 2021 and December 2020, NEP issued $500 million and $600 million, respectively, principal amount of new senior unsecured convertible notes. Holders of these notes may convert all or a portion of the notes in accordance with the related indenture. Upon conversion, NEP will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, NEP common units or a combination of cash and common units, at NEP's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEP's conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted.\n\nCommon Stock Dividend Restrictions -  NEE's  charter  does  not  limit  the  dividends  that  may  be  paid  on  its  common  stock.  FPL's  mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\n\nStock-Based Compensation - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $119 million, $107 million and $100 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $19 million, $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately $148 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 84 million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards - Restricted stock typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n\nThe activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows:\n\n",

The IRA extends, expands, and increases ITCs and PTCs for clean energy projects, allows PTCs for solar projects, adds ITCs for stand-alone energy storage projects with an option to elect out of the tax normalization requirement, and allows for the transferability of the tax  credits. The IRA extends and increases the tax credits for CCS projects and adds tax credits for clean hydrogen and nuclear projects. Additional ITC and PTC amounts are available if the projects meet domestic content requirements or are located in low-income or energy communities. The IRA also enacted a 15% CAMT on book income, with material adjustments for pension costs and tax depreciation. The 15% CAMT on book income can be reduced by tax credits.\n\nFor solar projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC and an option to claim a PTC instead of an ITC. Starting in 2023 and through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC for stand-alone energy storage projects. For wind projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 100% PTC, adjusted for inflation annually. For projects placed in service before 2022, the 2024 PTC rate is 2.9 cents per KWH. For projects placed in service in 2022 and later, the 2024 PTC rate is 3 cents per KWH. The same PTC rate applies for solar projects for which the PTC option has been elected. To realize the full value of ITCs and PTCs, the IRA requires satisfaction of prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.\n\nIn April 2024, the IRS issued final regulations related to the transfer of tax  credits. In 2024, Alabama Power, G eorgia Power, and Southern Power entered into purchase and sale agreements with non-affiliated parties to sell ITCs and PTCs at a discount to the generated credit value in 2024, 2025, and 2026. The discount will be recorded as a reduction in tax  credits recognized in the financial statements. The Southern Company system continues to explore the ability to efficiently monetize tax credits through third-party transferability agreements. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power have nuclear generating facilities that may qualify to generate and claim PTCs under the IRA beginning in 2024.\n\nOn September 12, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued a notice of proposed regulations that would address the application of the CAMT. Southern Company is evaluating the proposed regulations and is subject to the CAMT for the 2024 tax year, primarily driven by tax deductions for Georgia Power's storm restoration costs and the natural gas safe harbor tax accounting method change, based on interpretations of the early CAMT guidance. The CAMT will primarily be satisfied by tax  credits for the 2024 tax  year. The CAMT impacts operating cash flows of certain Registrants but will not impact the Registrants' net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Storm Damage Recovery\" for additional information on Georgia Power's storm restoration costs. Also see \"Natural Gas Safe Harbor Method\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nImplementation of the IRA provisions related to existing nuclear generating facilities and CAMT is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS. The Registrants are still evaluating the impacts, and the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Georgia State Tax Legislation\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the State of Georgia enacted tax legislation that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 5.75% to 5.39% effective for the 2024 tax  year. This legislation reduced the amount of Southern Company's and certain subsidiaries' income tax expense in the State of Georgia and existing state net accumulated deferred tax liabilities, increased regulatory liabilities at G eorgia Power and Southern Company Gas, and reduces Georgia Power's ability to utilize certain state tax credits in the State of G eorgia. The legislation did not have a material impact on the net income of the applicable Registrants.\n\n## Natural Gas Safe Harbor Method\n\nIn April 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor tax method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures to maintain, repair, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized or allowed as repair deductions. The revenue procedure allows multiple alternatives for implementation which will result in a tax  accounting method change for Southern Company Gas' eligible expenditures. On April 30, 2024, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2024-23, which gives additional implementation guidance on the natural gas safe harbor tax method of accounting for qualifying repair deductions. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas intend to submit a tax accounting method change for qualifying expenditures with the filing of the 2024 federal income tax  return. The new tax  method of accounting is ex pected to result in a material net positive cash flow for Southern Company Gas; however, the",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company identified that rising environmental compliance costs could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas from industrial customers (SO_10k_2022.pdf:page_34:chunk_1). These costs were typically recovered through regulated rates, but the potential for decreased industrial demand posed a risk to revenue and financial stability. By 2023, Southern Power responded by entering into long-term PPAs with industrial customers, where 41% of counterparties were rated AAA to A- or equivalent, and an additional 47% were BBB+ to BBB- rated, indicating a strategic shift toward securing high-credit-quality partners (SO_10k_2023.pdf:page_13:chunk_1). These PPAs included capacity charges designed to recover fixed and variable costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year, ensuring a more stable revenue stream despite potential fluctuations in industrial demand (SO_10k_2023.pdf:page_89:chunk_1). This demonstrates a direct evolution from risk identification in 2022 to risk mitigation through structured agreements and counterparty selection in 2023.",

The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand, which could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated gas distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience underrecovered fuel and/or purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred.\n\n## The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants.\n\nThe consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.\n\nOutside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences, legislation, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy. For example, some cities in the United States have banned the use of natural gas in new construction.\n\nBoth federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy efficiency.\n\nCustomers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts.\n\nIn addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available methods and experience to incorporate the effects of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects.\n\nThe operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary Registrant.\n\nElectric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.\n\nVolatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, and the natural gas distribution and storage facilities of Southern Company Gas. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states which could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.\n\nIn the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency.

      "answer": "In 2022, Mississippi Power highlighted the regulatory risk tied to the Mississippi Public Service Commission\u2019s (MPSC) determination of which costs would be recoverable through future rates, including the potential disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed or under-construction plant assets. By 2023, Southern Company\u2019s disclosures reflected increased audit scrutiny on these very assumptions, with Deloitte specifically testing management\u2019s judgments around cost recovery likelihood, potential refunds, and regulatory asset recognition. The evolution shows a deepening focus on the uncertainty of regulatory outcomes, particularly around large capital investments, indicating that the regulatory risk exposure not only persisted but became more complex and subject to greater external validation.",

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Mississippi Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Mississippi Power) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nMississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the \"Commissions\"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets - asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Mississippi Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAtlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC.\n\nSee \"Rate Proceedings - Atlanta Gas Light\" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 18, 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024.\n\n## Chattanooga Gas\n\nIn June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.\n\n## Natural Gas Cost Recovery\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, the over recovered balance was $88 million, which was included in other regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.\n\n## Rate Proceedings\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.\n\nIn July 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of $37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy used Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), such as CRC, to manage credit risk and account for certain receivables and collections. By 2024, this strategy evolved as Duke Energy Progress formed and consolidated DEPSC SF, a VIE specifically created to issue $177 million in senior secured bonds to finance storm-related regulatory assets from 2014 through 2022. This indicates a strategic shift toward using VIEs not only for credit risk mitigation but also for securitizing and recovering long-term storm-related costs through structured financing vehicles. The company leveraged its control over VIEs to isolate financial risk while ensuring recovery of storm-related expenditures through non-bypassable customer charges, showing a deliberate expansion of VIE usage for regulatory asset financing.",

          "chunk_text": "## MD&amp;A\n\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Derivatives and Hedging,' for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants' credit risk.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants' credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\n\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants' service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment as a result of the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the company has resumed standard payment arrangement options . The Duke Energy Registrants are still monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties' abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants have observed a significant increase in utility account arrears as of December 31, 2021. There is an expectation of an increase in charge-offs in the future and the Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Revenue,\" respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Variable Interest Entities.'\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.\n\nDuke Energy's Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate selfinsured retention.

      "question": "How did the classification of Duke Energy's debt investments as AFS securities change between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of unrealized gain/loss treatment and regulatory deferral practices?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy classified debt investments as AFS, with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income until realized. By 2023, this classification remained consistent, but the company emphasized that substantially all AFS securities qualified for regulatory accounting, resulting in deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses as regulatory assets or liabilities. Additionally, in 2023, Duke Energy noted that unrealized credit losses on AFS securities were included in earnings if identified, though no material credit losses were reported in either year. This indicates a continuation of AFS classification but a more detailed articulation of regulatory deferral alignment in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Debt Investments: Duke Energy Carolinas classified debt investments as AFS in 2022, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income until realization.",
        "Hop 2: Debt Investments \u2192 AFS: Debt investments are explicitly classified as AFS, indicating a specific accounting treatment for these securities.",
        "Hop 3: AFS \u2190 DUK(2023): In 2023, Duke Energy further clarified that AFS debt investments largely qualified for regulatory accounting, with unrealized and realized gains/losses deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities, and noted immediate recognition of unrealized credit losses if identified."
