      "answer": "In 2022, COF identified Strategic Risk as a material concern, particularly the risk of failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in its strategy, which could impact earnings, capital, or enterprise value. By 2024, COF had evolved its approach by actively monitoring implementation risks as part of its Strategic Risk Management framework, with oversight from the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer and integration into the company\u2019s annual risk assessment cycle. This reflects a shift from merely identifying implementation risks as a concern in 2022 to systematically managing and monitoring them by 2024, aligning strategic execution with enterprise value protection.",

Market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. We manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our ex posure.\n\nThe Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Head of Liquidity, Market, and Capital Risk Oversight, is responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. The market risk position is calculated and analyzed against pre-established limits. We use industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk and we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk ex posures under a broad range of scenarios. Results are reported to the Asset Liability Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee no less than quarterly.\n\nManagement is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure. Investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate risk. In addition, we also use derivatives to manage our foreign exchange risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Management\n\nWe recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. We have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner.\n\nThe Chief Operational Risk Officer, in collaboration with the CTRO, is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Operational Risk Management Program. The program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks. These risks include topics such as internal and external fraud, cybersecurity and technology risk, data management, model risk, third-party management, and business continuity. Operational Risk Management and Technology Risk Management enforce these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors. For additional information on how we manage cybersecurity and technology risk, see 'Part I-Item 1C. Cybersecurity' of this Report.\n\n## Reputation Risk Management\n\nWe recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and, increasingly, technology companies, in the current environment. Areas of concern have expanded to include company policies, practices and values and, with the growing use of social and digital platforms, public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy. The heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change. We manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, customers and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our Company and industry. Our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank and an innovative technology leader. The Executive V ice President of External Affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. Day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our Reputation Risk Management Policy and other risk management policies.\n\n## Strategic Risk Management\n\nWe recognize that strategic risk is present within our business and the Company's strategy. We monitor risks for the impact on current or future earnings, capital growth or enterprise value arising from changes to the Company's competitive and market positions, including as a result of evolving forces in the industry. Additionally, we monitor timely and effective responsiveness to these conditions, strategic decisions that impact the Company's scale, market position or operating model and failure to appropriately consider implementation risks in the Company's strategy. Potential areas of opportunity or risk inform the Company's strategy, which is led by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The Chief Enterprise Risk Officer, in consultation with the Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer, oversees the identification and assessment of risks associated with the Company's strategy and the monitoring of these risks throughout the year.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard emphasized its traditional payment solutions, including its multi-rail payments network and ACH capabilities, as core to its business model. By 2024, the company had strategically shifted to depend on digital currencies, as evidenced by its integration with blockchain ecosystems and the Mastercard Multi-Token Network\u2122. During this period, the company acknowledged the disruptive potential of digital currencies, which it noted in 2024 could both compete with and complement its traditional offerings. This evolution reflects a strategic pivot to align with emerging trends while managing the risks associated with digital assets.",

By 2024, Capital One Financial Corp maintained a Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.8%, significantly above the 6.0% 'Well-Capitalized' threshold, demonstrating strong regulatory compliance and capital resilience.

The  FDICIA  establishes  five  capital  ratio  levels:  well  capitalized;  adequately  capitalized;  undercapitalized; significantly undercapitalized; and critically undercapitalized. The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution. The capital categories relate to the FDICIA's PCA provisions, and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Banks' overall financial condition or prospects.",

This rule supplements the Basel III Capital Rules, which set minimum CET1 capital requirements. By 2023, COF's CET1 capital ratio stood at 12.9%, reflecting adjustments under the Basel III framework, including the ongoing phase-in of the CECL Transition Rule. The phased-in impact of $1.2 billion remaining from the CECL Transition Rule as of 2023 further influenced the CET1 ratio, demonstrating how the interplay between the Market Risk Rule and Basel III Capital Rules shaped COF's capital position over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBased on the Company's 2020 supervisory stress testing results, the Company's stress capital buffer requirement was 5.6% for the period  from  October  1,  2020  through  September  30,  2021.  Therefore,  the  Company's  minimum  capital  requirements  plus  the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework were 10.1%, 11.6% and 13.6%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021.\n\nBased on the Company's 2021 supervisory stress testing results, the Company's stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is 2.5%. Therefore, the Company's minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Banks. The capital conservation buffer for the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, each Bank's minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5% respectively.\n\nIf the Company or any of the Banks fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital  conservation  buffer  requirements,  it  will  face  increasingly  strict  automatic  limitations  on  capital  distributions  and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, each of the Company and the Banks exceeded the minimum capital requirements and  the  capital  conservation  buffer  requirements  applicable  to  them,  and  each  of  the  Company  and  the  Banks  was  'wellcapitalized.' The 'well-capitalized' standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve's regulations, and the 'well-capitalized' standards applicable to the Banks are established in the OCC's PCA capital requirements.\n\n## Market Risk Rule\n\nThe 'Market Risk Rule' supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See 'MD&amp;A-Market Risk Profile' below for additional information.\n\n## CECL Transition Rule\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the 'CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit loss ('CECL') standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "In 2023, AXP's interest rate risk management assumed that interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities would generally reprice by the same magnitude, subject to applicable interest rate caps or floors, as benchmark rates change. This assumption was carried forward into 2024, where the repricing risk explicitly considered the impact of these caps and floors, along with the potential for certain deposits to reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements. The 2024 sensitivity analysis continued to reflect the detrimental impact of higher interest rates on net interest income, showing a direct evolution of the repricing risk framework shaped by the interest rate caps introduced in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AXP(2023) \u2192 Interest Rate Caps: AXP explicitly incorporated interest rate caps and floors into their 2023 interest rate risk assumptions when modeling repricing behavior of assets and liabilities.",
        "Hop 2: Interest Rate Caps \u2192 Repricing Risk: The presence of interest rate caps directly shaped the repricing risk framework by constraining how much rates could adjust in response to benchmark rate changes.",

By fiscal year 2024, the conversion rate had increased to 6.8340, leading to 22 million as-converted Class A shares from the same 3 million Series C shares. This doubling of the conversion rate suggests that the intrinsic value or relative equity valuation of Class A Common Stock may have increased significantly, or that the preferred stock terms were adjusted to reflect new capital structure dynamics or market conditions.

      "answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan disclosed that the Purchase Money Note was associated with the First Republic acquisition and referenced Note 34 for details. The fair value of such notes, including those from First Republic, was estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated expected credit losses, interest rates, and prepayment rates. By 2024, the fair value adjustment for First Republic's residential real estate lending-related commitments had decreased from $630 million in 2023 to $459 million in 2024. This decline suggests a shift in underlying assumptions such as increased expected credit losses or changes in interest rate environments that affected the valuation model, reflecting a more conservative outlook or improved credit performance depending on directional interpretation.",

      "question": "How did the reorganization of MetLife's U.S. segment into Group Benefits and Retirement and Income Solutions (RIS) in 2023 affect the company's life insurance disclosures compared to 2022, particularly in relation to the broader suite of RIS offerings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed $22,872 million in life insurance revenue under the U.S. segment, which included both Group Benefits and RIS. In 2023, the company reorganized its segments, separating Group Benefits and RIS into distinct reporting units. This reorganization reflects a strategic shift to emphasize RIS as a standalone business unit, which includes life insurance as part of a broader set of retirement and annuity-based products. The change in structure likely resulted in a more focused analysis of life insurance performance within RIS, aligning it with stable value, pension risk transfer, and structured settlement products. This evolution suggests a deeper integration of life insurance within a diversified retirement solutions framework, potentially influencing how life insurance revenue is assessed in the context of broader RIS offerings.",

These products are sold to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. The U.S. segment is organized into two businesses: Group Benefits and Retirement and Income Solutions ('RIS'). Prior to its disposition, the Property &amp; Casualty business was included in the U.S. segment. See Note 3.\n\n- The  Group  Benefits  business  offers  products  such  as  term,  variable  and  universal  life  insurance,  dental,  group  and individual disability, vision and accident &amp; health insurance.\n- The RIS business offers a broad range of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products, including stable value and pension risk transfer products, institutional income annuities, structured settlements, longevity reinsurance solutions, benefit funding solutions and capital markets investment products.\n\n## Asia\n\nThe Asia  segment  offers  a  broad  range  of  products  and  services  to  both  individuals  and  corporations,  as  well  as  to  other institutions, and their respective employees, which include life insurance, accident &amp; health insurance and retirement and savings.\n\n## Latin America\n\nThe  Latin  America  segment  offers  a  broad  range  of  products  to  both  individuals  and  corporations,  as  well  as  to  other institutions, and their respective employees, which include life insurance, retirement and savings, accident &amp; health insurance and credit insurance.\n\n## EMEA\n\nThe  EMEA  segment  offers  products  to  individuals,  corporations,  other  institutions,  and  their  respective  employees,  which include life insurance, accident &amp; health insurance, retirement and savings and credit insurance.\n\n## MetLife Holdings\n\nThe MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses that the Company no longer actively markets  in  the  United  States.  These  include  variable,  universal,  term  and  whole  life  insurance,  variable,  fixed  and  index-linked annuities, and long-term care insurance.\n\n## Corporate &amp; Other\n\nCorporate &amp; Other contains various start-up, developing and run-off businesses. Also included in Corporate &amp; Other are: the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments (including external integration and disposition costs,  internal  resource  costs  for  associates  committed  to  acquisitions  and  dispositions  and  enterprise-wide  strategic  initiative restructuring charges), interest expense related to the majority of the Company's outstanding debt, expenses associated with certain legal  proceedings  and  income  tax  audit  issues,  the  elimination  of  intersegment  amounts  (which  generally  relate  to  affiliated reinsurance,  investment  expenses  and  intersegment  loans  bearing  interest  rates  commensurate  with  related  borrowings),  and  the Company's investment management business (through which the Company provides public fixed income, private capital and real estate investment solutions to institutional investors worldwide).\n\n## Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies\n\nAdjusted earnings is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment  reporting,  adjusted  earnings  is  also  the  Company's  GAAP  measure  of  segment  performance  and  is  reported  below. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). The Company believes the presentation of adjusted earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\n\nAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of Capital One's stress testing practices from 2022 to 2024 impact their reliance on specific funding sources under liquidity stress scenarios, particularly in light of changes in coverage ratios and asset liquidity assumptions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One disclosed that stress testing was used to re-measure asset liquidity and coverage ratios under defined liquidity stress scenarios, which directly impacted the adequacy of available liquidity sources. Specifically, the company emphasized the importance of converting assets into cash under stressed conditions to meet forecasted cash flows. By 2024, the company expressed concerns about maintaining adequate funding sources, noting that unexpected variations in inputs\u2014such as interest rate fluctuations and market disruptions\u2014could impair its ability to rely on those same liquidity sources. The 2024 report highlighted that under stress, the company might face early amortization of securitization transactions or reduced value of securities held for liquidity, which could accelerate the need for alternative funding. This indicates that while the company maintained stress testing as a core practice, the assumptions around asset convertibility and coverage ratios became more uncertain, increasing the risk around funding source reliability.",

Capital  One's  risk aggregation processes are designed to aggregate risk information from lower levels of the business hierarchy to high levels and to aggregate risk information to determine material risk themes.\n\nMaterial  risks,  new  or  emerging  risks,  aggregate  risks,  risk  appetite  metrics  and  other  measures  across  all  risk  categories  are reported to the appropriate governance forum no less than quarterly. Material risks are reported to the Board of Directors and senior management committees no less than quarterly.\n\n## Capital and Liquidity Management (including Stress Testing)\n\nOur  capital  management  processes  are  linked  to  its  risk  management  practices,  including  the  enterprise-wide  identification, assessment and measurement of risks to ensure that all relevant risks are incorporated in the assessment of the Company's capital adequacy. We use identified risks to inform key aspects of the Company's capital planning, including the development of stress scenarios,  the  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  post-stress  capital  levels,  and  the  appropriateness  of  potential  capital  actions considering the Company's capital objectives. We quantify capital needs through stress testing, regulatory capital, economic capital and  assessments  of  market  considerations.  In  assessing  its  capital  adequacy,  we  identify  how  and  where  our  material  risks  are accounted for within the capital planning process. Monitoring and escalation processes exist for key capital thresholds and metrics to continuously monitor capital adequacy.\n\nWe manage liquidity risk by applying our Liquidity Adequacy Framework (the 'Liquidity Framework'). The Liquidity Framework uses internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient  to  uncertainties  that  may  arise  as  a  consequence  of  systemic,  idiosyncratic,  or  combined  liquidity events.\n\n## Risk Data and Enabling Technology\n\nRisk data and technology provides the basis for risk reporting and is used in decision making and to monitor and review changes to our risk profile. There is a core Governance, Risk Management and Compliance system which is used as the system of record for risks, controls, issues and events for our risk categories and supports the analysis, aggregation and reporting capabilities across the categories.\n\n## Culture and Talent Management\n\nThe Framework must be supported with the right culture, talent and skills to enable effective risk management across the Company.\n\nEvery associate at the Company is responsible for risk management; however, associates with specific risk management skills and expertise within the first, second and third lines of defense are critical to execute appropriate risk management across the enterprise.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nparticularly if unex pected variations in key inputs and assumptions cause actual losses to diverge from the projections of our models and our estimates become increasingly subject to management's judgment. See ' We face risks resulting from the extensive use of models and data, as well as our evolving use of AI. '\n\n## Fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLike other financial institutions, our business is sensitive to interest rate movements. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the results of our operations and financial condition. For ex ample, higher interest rates may increase our borrowing costs and may require us to increase the interest we pay on funds deposited with us and may reduce the market value of our securities holdings. If interest rates increase or if higher interest rates persist for an extended period of time, our ex penses may increase further. On the other hand, lower interest rates could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the rate of economic growth decreased sharply, causing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, our net income could be adversely affected. While higher interest rates generally enhance our ability to grow our net interest income, there are potential risks associated with operating in a higher interest rate environment. For example, some customers have been and may continue to be less willing or able overall to borrow at higher interest rates. Higher interest rates also have hindered and may continue to hinder the ability of some borrowers to support required loan payments.\n\nAdditionally, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as customers or commercial clients default on their loans, maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, reduce demand for credit or (for existing customers) the level of borrowing or purchase activity. For example, increases in interest rates increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers, which may adversely affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually obligated. This could result in additional or fluctuating delinquencies or charge-offs and negatively impact our results of operations. These changes could reduce the overall yield on our interest-earning asset portfolio.\n\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our net interest income and earnings, economic value and capital under various interest rate scenarios of different direction and magnitude. We take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments. For example, the Company employs various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. The Company's hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, the Company may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. We face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed.\n\nChanges in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. Such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing. See 'Part II-Item 7. MD&amp;A-Market Risk Profile' and ' We face intense competition in all of our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation ' for additional information.\n\n## We may not be able to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to operate our business.\n\nWe may not be able to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to fund our operations, grow our business, pay our outstanding liabilities and meet regulatory expectations. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, including disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets. Additionally, increased charge-offs, rising interest rates, increased refinancing activity and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled or reduce the value of the securities that we hold for liquidity purposes, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources. We could also experience impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position, including possible constraints on liquidity and capital, as well as higher costs of capital.\n\nIn addition, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include increases in funding costs, downturns in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated, difficulties in credit markets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, including as a result of unusual effects in the market.\n\n27\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "question": "How did the change in MetLife's valuation methodology for embedded derivatives between 2022 and 2024 reflect evolving nonperformance risk assumptions, particularly in relation to the use of risk margins and unobservable inputs?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that the valuation of embedded derivatives included significant unobservable inputs such as extrapolation beyond observable limits of swap yield curves, actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior and mortality, and the cost of capital for risk margins. These risk margins were established to account for non-capital market risks, including policyholder behavior uncertainties and nonperformance risk. By 2024, while the core valuation methodology remained consistent\u2014using actuarial and capital market techniques like Black-Scholes for embedded equity indexed derivatives\u2014MetLife emphasized that changes in nonperformance risk continued to affect valuations. However, there was a greater focus on the observability of inputs, with transfers into and out of Level 3 classifications based on whether significant inputs could be corroborated with market data. This indicates a more dynamic treatment of nonperformance risk, where evolving market conditions and transparency of inputs led to adjustments in how risk margins were applied within the embedded derivative valuations.",

Fair Value (continued)\n\nRisk  margins  are  established  to  capture  the  non-capital  market  risks  of  the  instrument  which  represent  the  additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization,  premium  persistency,  partial  withdrawal  and  surrenders.  The  establishment  of  risk  margins  requires  the  use  of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to,  changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income.\n\nThe  Company  ceded  the  risk  associated  with  certain  of  the  GMIBs  previously  described.  These  reinsurance  agreements contain embedded derivatives which are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses) or policyholder benefits and claims depending on  the  statement  of  operations  classification  of  the  direct  risk.  The  value  of  the  embedded  derivatives  on  the  ceded  risk  is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio backing the funds  withheld  liability.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  is  determined  as  described  in  '-  Investments -  Securities,  Short-term  Investments  and  Other  Investments.'  The  estimated  fair  value  of  these  embedded  derivatives  is included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair  value  recorded  in  net  derivative  gains  (losses).  Changes  in  the  credit  spreads  on  the  underlying  assets,  interest  rates  and market  volatility  may  result  in  significant  fluctuations  in  the  estimated  fair  value  of  these  embedded  derivatives  that  could materially affect net income.\n\nThe Company issues certain annuity contracts which allow the policyholder to participate in returns from equity indices. These equity indexed features are embedded derivatives which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host fixed annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded equity indexed derivatives, based on the present value of future equity returns to the  policyholder  using  actuarial  and  present  value  assumptions  including  expectations  concerning  policyholder  behavior,  is calculated by the Company's actuarial department. The calculation is based on in-force business and uses standard capital market techniques, such as Black-Scholes, to calculate the value of the portion of the embedded derivative for which the terms are set. The portion of the embedded derivative covering the period beyond where terms are set is calculated as the present value of amounts expected to be spent to provide equity indexed returns in those periods. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes the establishment of a risk margin, as well as changes in nonperformance risk.\n\n## Embedded Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts\n\n## Level 3 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\n\nDirect and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits\n\nThese embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing techniques,  which  utilize  significant  inputs  that  may  include  swap  yield  curves,  currency  exchange  rates  and  implied volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curves and implied volatilities,  actuarial  assumptions  for  policyholder  behavior  and  mortality  and  the  potential  variability  in  policyholder behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin.",

      "answer": "In 2022, V had 245 million shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, which converted into 394 million Class A Common Stock shares based on a conversion rate of 1.6059. By 2024, the number of Class B shares outstanding dropped to 125 million, while the number of Class A shares increased from 1,677 million in 2023 to 1,733 million in 2024. This reflects a shift in capital structure where the company reduced its Class B shares, likely through conversion, while increasing Class A shares. The conversion rate slightly increased to 1.6228 in 2024, indicating a small change in the conversion dynamics. This evolution suggests a strategic shift toward a more voting-rights-inclusive shareholder base, as Class A shares carry full voting rights, unlike Class B shares.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife's Life Insurance revenue reached $22,872M, reflecting a growing trend in this product line. The company's Retirement and Income Solutions (RIS) segment, which includes life insurance and annuity-based products, served as the bridge for managing institutional income annuities and pension risk transfers. By 2024, MetLife formalized its strategic positioning in this space by forming Chariot Reinsurance, a life and annuity reinsurance company in partnership with General Atlantic. MetLife will hold an equity stake in Chariot Re and intends to cede a block of structured settlement and pension risk transfer annuity contracts to the new entity. The evolution from Life Insurance revenue growth in 2022 to the formation of Chariot Re in 2024 was facilitated through the RIS segment\u2019s role in managing and scaling annuity and pension risk transfer products.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AXP's subsidiary AENB had approximately 2.4 million direct retail deposit accounts, and by 2024 this grew to 3.3 million accounts. Over the same period, AXP's Certificates of Deposit (CDs) increased from $129.1 billion in total deposits (2023) to $139.4 billion (2024), indicating a significant growth in CD liabilities. This expansion aligns with AENB's role in offering CDs as a core deposit product, which is influenced by regulatory capital requirements introduced in August 2023 that mandated minimum levels of eligible internal long-term debt. The increase in CDs likely reflects a strategic response to these new liquidity and capital rules, using insured deposits as a stable and cost-effective funding source.",

Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. direct deposits insured by the FDIC to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.\n\nIn August, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require covered bank holding companies such as American Express Company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external long-term debt and certain insured depository institutions such as AENB to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible internal long-term debt. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Capital and Liquidity Regulation' under 'Business' for more information.\n\n## DEPOSIT PROGRAMS\n\nWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category through the FDIC; as of December 31, 2024, approximately 92 percent of these deposits were insured. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. The direct deposit program offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account, certificates of deposit (CDs), business checking and consumer rewards checking account products available directly to customers. As of December 31, 2024, our direct deposit program had approximately 3.3 million accounts. AENB also sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. CDs carry stated maturities while high-yield savings account, checking account and third-party sweep deposit products do not. We manage the duration of our maturing obligations, including CDs, to reduce concentration and refinancing risk.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $139.4 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits.\n\nThe following table sets forth the average interest rates we paid on different types of deposits during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Changes in the average interest rate we paid on our deposits were primarily due to the impact of higher market interest rates offered for retail deposits.\n\n## TABLE 20: AVERAGE INTEREST RATES PAID ON DEPOSITS\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, the amortization of the deferred gain related to the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO was $48 million, and it increased significantly to $322 million in 2024. This sharp increase suggests that the settlement period of the ceded reserves is accelerating, which could be due to faster-than-expected loss payments or updated estimates affecting the amortization schedule. The collateral trust account, created by NICO and funded with the consideration paid under the agreement, continues to serve as security for their claim payment obligations, indicating ongoing financial backing for the agreement.

This borrowing capacity was supported in part by SCHW's banking subsidiaries' secured credit facilities with the FHLB, which were dependent on the value of First Mortgages and HELOCs pledged as collateral\u2014$63.5 billion in borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, SCHW disclosed that HELOCs were structured with 30-year terms, including a 10-year draw period followed by a 20-year amortizing period. This long-term maturity structure of HELOCs likely provided more stable and extended collateral value, supporting sustained access to secured financing and aligning with CSC\u2019s use of short-term commercial paper to manage liquidity.

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported $2,131 million in Level 3 assets categorized under separate accounts, which decreased to $1,147 million by the end of 2023. This reduction indicates a significant de-risking move in their alternative investment portfolio, particularly in assets with limited price transparency and higher liquidity risk. The Level 3 asset category explicitly includes separate accounts invested in assets that provide little or no price transparency due to infrequent trading and longer liquidation periods. The $984 million decline in separate accounts categorized under Level 3 suggests MetLife actively reduced exposure to opaque, illiquid investments over this period.",

        "Hop 1: MET(2022) \u2192 Level 3 Asset Category: MetLife disclosed $2,131 million in Level 3 assets under separate accounts in 2022, characterized by low price transparency and higher liquidity risk.",

      "answer": "Capital One adopted ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, which eliminated the 'concession' requirement for troubled debt restructurings and introduced the concept of Financial Difficulty Modifications (FDMs). This change expanded the eligibility criteria for modifications, allowing more borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to qualify even if the modification terms were not below market rates. By 2024, Capital One was fully operating under this new framework, defining FDMs as modifications involving principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, significant payment delays, or term extensions. The broader definition led to increased disclosures around FDMs, including performance tracking post-modification, which was not as detailed under the previous TDR framework.",

        "Hop 1: COF(2023) \u2192 Disclosure Requirements: Capital One adopted ASU 2022-02, which introduced new disclosure requirements for loan modifications made to borrowers in financial difficulty.",
        "Hop 2: Disclosure Requirements \u2192 ASU 2022-02: The ASU eliminated troubled debt restructurings and established FDMs as the new category of loan modifications, requiring more detailed disclosures on performance post-modification.",
        "Hop 3: ASU 2022-02 \u2190 COF(2024): In 2024, Capital One complied with the new standard, defining and applying FDMs consistently under the updated accounting policy, with expanded eligibility criteria and enhanced reporting."

      "question": "How did the adoption of ASU 2022-02 in 2023 impact COF's recognition of loan modifications for borrowers in financial difficulty in 2024, and what new framework replaced the previous TDR accounting guidance?",
      "answer": "Capital One adopted ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, which eliminated the previous accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs). In 2024, this led to the introduction of a new framework under which loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are now classified as Financial Difficulty Modifications (FDMs). Unlike TDRs, FDMs include principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment delays, or term extensions, and are recognized under the updated standards introduced by ASU 2022-02.",

        "Hop 1: COF(2023) \u2192 Troubled Debt Restructuring: Discloses the elimination of TDR accounting guidance effective January 1, 2023, due to ASU 2022-02.",

      "question": "How did the introduction of the Expanded Risk-Based Approach through the Basel III Finalization Proposal in 2023 influence Capital One's capital adequacy requirements and risk-weighted asset calculations in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Capital One, as a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules, was subject to minimum CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0%, and 8.0% respectively, calculated under the Basel III standardized approach. In July 2023, the Basel III Finalization Proposal was introduced, which proposed the Expanded Risk-Based Approach for institutions with $100 billion+ in assets. This new framework would require Capital One to calculate risk-weighted assets under both the existing standardized approach and the new Expanded Risk-Based Approach, being bound by the lower resulting capital ratio. Additionally, the proposal would require Category III institutions like Capital One to begin recognizing certain elements of AOCI, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, in CET1 capital, while also lowering the threshold for deductions from CET1 capital. By 2024, Capital One was preparing for these changes, with the Expanded Risk-Based Approach set to be phased in from July 1, 2025, through July 1, 2028. This represents a significant shift in how Capital One must manage its capital adequacy and risk-weighted asset calculations going forward.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Market Risk Rule\n\nThe 'Market Risk Rule' supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2024, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See 'Part II \u4e00 Item 7. MD&amp;A \u4e00 Market Risk Profile' for additional information.\n\n## Basel III Finalization Proposal\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking ('Basel III Finalization Proposal') to revise the Basel III Capital Rules applicable to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would introduce a new framework for calculating risk-weighted assets ('Expanded Risk-Based Approach'). An institution subject to the proposal would be required to calculate its risk-weighted assets under both the Expanded Risk-Based Approach and the existing Basel III standardized approach and, for each risk-based capital ratio, would be bound by the calculation that produces the lower ratio. All capital buffer requirements, including the stress capital buffer requirement, would apply regardless of whether the Expanded Risk-Based Approach or the existing Basel III standardized approach produces the lower ratio. The proposal would also replace the existing approach for calculating market risk with a new approach based on both internal models and standardized methodologies.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would also make certain changes to the calculation of regulatory capital for Category III and IV  institutions. Under the proposal, these institutions would be required to begin recognizing certain elements of AOCI in CET1 capital, including unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. The proposal would also generally reduce the threshold above which these institutions must deduct certain assets from their CET1 capital, including certain deferred tax  assets, mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal includes a proposed effective date of July 1, 2025, subject to a three-year transition period ending July 1, 2028, over which risk-weighted assets calculated under the Ex panded Risk-Based Approach and the recognition of AOCI in CET1 capital would be phased in. It is uncertain when or if a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the Basel III Finalization Proposal. As a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on the Company and the Bank, remain uncertain.\n\n## FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ('FDICIA') requires the Federal Banking Agencies to take PCA for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well capitalized; adequately capitalized; undercapitalized; significantly undercapitalized; and critically undercapitalized. The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution. The capital categories relate to FDICIA's PCA provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Bank's overall financial condition or prospects.\n\nFor an insured depository institution to be well capitalized, it must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or more; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a leverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for Category III and certain other institutions, a supplementary leverage ratio of 3% or more. The PCA provisions also authorize the Federal Banking Agencies to reclassify a\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

The fair value of these certificates of deposit is determined using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs  referencing  identical  or  comparable  securities,  including  prices  to which the deposits are linked, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency  rates,  equity  prices,  and  the  impact  of  the  Firm's  own  credit spreads, adjusted for the impact of the FDIC insurance, which is based on vanilla deposit issuance rates.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level 2-when valuation inputs are observable\n- Level 3-in instances where an unobservable input is deemed significant\n\n## Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- Fair value is computed using a standard cash flow discounting methodology.\n- The  inputs  to  the  valuation  include  contractual  cash  flows  and  collateral funding spreads, which are the incremental spread over the OIS rate for a specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral).\n- Valuation Hierarchy Classification:\n- Level 2-when the valuation inputs are observable and supported by market liquidity\n- Level  3-in  instances  where  the  valuation  input  is  observable  but  not supported  by  market  liquidity  or  if  an  unobservable  input  is  deemed significant\n\n## Other Secured Financings\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- Other  secured  financings  are  composed  of  short-dated  notes  secured  by Corporate  equities,  agreements  to  repurchase  Physical  commodities,  the liabilities related to sales of Loans and lending commitments accounted for as  financings,  and  secured  contracts  that  are  not  classified  as  OTC derivatives because they fail net investment criteria.

Also included are unsecured contracts that are not classified as OTC derivatives because they fail initial net investment criteria.\n- Fair value is determined using valuation models for the derivative and debt portions  of  the  instruments.  These  models  incorporate  observable  inputs referencing identical or comparable securities, including prices to which the instruments  are  linked,  interest  rate  yield  curves,  option  volatility  and currency rates, and commodity or equity prices.\n- Independent, external and traded prices are considered, as well as the impact of the Firm's own credit spreads, which are based on observed secondary bond market spreads.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife's statutory accounting practices treated surplus notes as surplus rather than debt, which directly impacted statutory capital and surplus calculations for its U.S. insurance subsidiaries. This treatment was a key distinction between statutory accounting and GAAP. By 2024, surplus notes were explicitly referenced in the context of debt structuring and financing arrangements, where they were described as subordinate to all other obligations of the issuing operating company but senior to obligations of MetLife, Inc. itself. Additionally, surplus notes were used as part of a collateral financing arrangement, indicating a strategic integration into the company's broader capital structure and liquidity planning. This evolution suggests that MetLife refined its use of surplus notes not only as a regulatory capital tool but also as a strategic instrument within its debt hierarchy and financing strategy.",

Equity (continued)\n\nPerformance Units amounts above represent aggregate awards at target, and do not reflect potential increases or decreases that may result from the performance factor. At December 31, 2021, the performance period for the 2019 - 2021 Performance Unit grants was completed, but the performance factor had not yet been determined. Included in the immediately preceding table are 156,090 outstanding Performance Units to which the 2019 - 2021 performance factor will be applied.\n\n## Statutory Equity and Income\n\nThe states of domicile of MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. insurance subsidiaries each impose risk-based capital ('RBC') requirements that were developed by the NAIC. American Life does not write business in Delaware or any other U.S. state and, as such, is exempt from RBC requirements by Delaware law. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's total adjusted capital, calculated in the manner prescribed by the NAIC ('TAC'), to its authorized control level RBC, calculated in the manner prescribed by the NAIC ('ACL RBC'), based on the statutory-based filed financial statements. Companies below specific trigger levels or ratios are classified by their respective levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences is twice ACL RBC ('Company Action Level RBC'). While not required by or filed with insurance regulators,  the  Company  also  calculates  an  internally  defined  combined  RBC  ratio  ('Statement-Based  Combined  RBC  Ratio'), which is determined by dividing the sum of TAC for MetLife, Inc.'s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life, by the sum of Company Action Level RBC for such subsidiaries. The Company's Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 360% and in excess of 350% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, all non-exempted U.S. insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded Company Action Level RBC for all periods presented.\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s foreign insurance operations are regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions in which each entity operates and are subject to minimum capital and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions before corrective action commences. At  December 31, 2021 and 2020, the adjusted capital  of American  Life's  insurance  subsidiary  in  Japan,  the  Company's  largest foreign  insurance  operation,  was  in  excess  of  four  times  the  200%  solvency  margin  ratio  that  would  require  corrective  action. Excluding Japan, the aggregate required capital and surplus of the Company's other foreign insurance operations was $4.3 billion and  the  aggregate  actual  regulatory  capital  and  surplus  of  such  operations  was  $10.6  billion  as  of  the  date  of  the  most  recent required capital adequacy calculation for each jurisdiction. The Company's foreign insurance operations exceeded the minimum capital and solvency requirements as of the date of the most recent fiscal year-end capital adequacy calculation for each jurisdiction.\n\nMetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries  prepare  statutory-basis  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  statutory  accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile or applicable foreign jurisdiction. The NAIC has adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles ('Statutory Codification'). Statutory Codification is intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments. However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices. Modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the effect of Statutory Codification on the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\n\nStatutory  accounting  principles  differ  from  GAAP  primarily  by  charging  policy  acquisition  costs  to  expense  as  incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.\n\nIn addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net deferred income tax assets resulting from temporary differences between statutory  accounting  principles  basis  and  tax  basis  not  expected  to  reverse  and  become  recoverable  within  three  years.  Further, statutory  accounting  principles  do  not  give  recognition  to  purchase  accounting  adjustments.  MetLife,  Inc.'s  U.S.  insurance subsidiaries have no material state prescribed accounting practices, except as described below.\n\nNew York has adopted certain prescribed accounting practices, primarily consisting of the continuous Commissioners' Annuity Reserve Valuation Method, which impacts deferred annuities, and the New York Special Considerations Letter, which mandates certain assumptions in asset adequacy testing. The collective impact of these prescribed accounting practices decreased the statutory capital and surplus of MLIC by $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared to what capital and surplus would have been had it been measured under NAIC guidance.",

MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance subsidiaries  are  subject  to  regulatory  restrictions  on  the  payment  of  dividends  imposed  by  the  regulators  of  their  respective domiciles.  See  Note  16  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  dividend  limitation  for  U.S.  insurance subsidiaries  is  generally  based  on  the  surplus  to  policyholders  at  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  calendar  year  and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.\n\nThe  table  below  sets  forth  the  dividends  permitted  to  be  paid  by  MetLife,  Inc.'s  primary  U.S.  insurance  subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid:\n\n",

Payments of interest and principal on the  Company's surplus notes, which are subordinate to all other obligations of the operating company issuing the notes and are senior to obligations of MetLife, Inc., may be made only with the prior approval of the insurance department of  the  state  of  domicile  of  the  issuer  of  the  notes.

      "answer": "In 2023, Morgan Stanley was evaluating the impact of the G-SIB Surcharge Proposal, which proposed reducing capital surcharge increments from 0.5 percentage points to 0.1 percentage points, with a potential effective date two quarters after final adoption. By 2024, the firm continued to evaluate its Required Capital framework in light of evolving regulatory requirements, including the Basel III Endgame and G-SIB surcharge proposals. This ongoing evaluation was reflected in the execution of their SPOE resolution strategy, which included transferring assets to Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC and entering into a secured support agreement to ensure liquidity and capital availability during resolution. The shift from analyzing potential surcharge changes to implementing structural capital and resolution adjustments demonstrates a strategic alignment with anticipated regulatory capital demands.",

We submitted our 2023 full resolution plan on  June  30,  2023.  In  June  2024,  we  received  joint  feedback  on  our  2023 resolution  plan  from  the  Agencies,  with  no  shortcomings  or  deficiencies identified.  Our  nex t  resolution  plan  submission  will  be  a  targeted  resolution plan in July 2025. For more information about resolution planning requirements, see 'Business-Supervision and Regulation-Financial Holding Company-Resolution and Recovery Planning.'\n\nAs  described  in  our  most  recent  resolution  plan,  our  preferred  resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nSPOE  strategy,  the  Parent  Company  has  transferred,  and  has  agreed  to transfer  on  an  ongoing  basis,  certain  assets  to  its  wholly  owned,  direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the 'Funding IHC'). In addition, the  Parent  Company  has  entered  into  an  amended  and  restated  support agreement with its material entities (including the  Funding  IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would  be  obligated  to  contribute  all  of  its  contributable  assets  to  our supported  entities  and/or  the  Funding  IHC.  The  Funding  IHC  would  be obligated  to  provide  capital  and  liquidity,  as  applicable,  to  our  supported entities.  The  combined  implication  of  the  SPOE  resolution  strategy  and  the requirement  to  maintain  certain  levels  of  TLAC  is  that  losses  in  resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible L TD and other forms of eligible TLAC  issued  by  the  Parent  Company  before  any  losses  are  imposed  on creditors of our supported entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support.\n\nThe  obligations  of  the  Parent  Company  and  the  Funding  IHC  under  the amended  and  restated  support  agreement  are  in  most  cases  secured  on  a senior  basis  by  the  assets  of  the  Parent  Company  (other  than  shares  in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the Funding IHC. As a result, claims of our supported entities, including the Funding  IHC,  with  respect  to  the  secured  assets,  are  effectively  senior  to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.\n\nFor  more  information  about  resolution  and  recovery  planning  requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see 'Business-Supervision and Regulation-Financial Holding Company-Resolution and Recovery Planning' and 'Risk FactorsLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.'\n\n## Regulatory Developments and Other Matters\n\n## Basel III Endgame and G-SIB Surcharge Proposals\n\nOn  July  27,  2023,  U.S.  banking  agencies  proposed  revisions  to  risk-based capital and related standards applicable to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries ('Basel III Endgame Proposal').

Cybersecurity\n\n## Cybersecurity Management &amp; Strategy\n\nWe manage information security risk through, and as part of, MetLife's Information Security Program (the 'Program'), instituted to maintain controls for the systems, applications, and databases of the Company and of its third-party providers. The primary goal of the Program is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all data MetLife owns or possesses, as well as its technology assets, through physical, technical, and administrative safeguards. This includes controls and procedures across business units and at the enterprise level for monitoring, detecting, reporting, containing, managing, and remediating cyber threats. The Program aims to prevent data exfiltration, manipulation, and destruction, as well as system and transactional disruption. The Program's threat-centric and risk-based approach for securing the MetLife environment takes into consideration applicable guidelines from the cybersecurity framework developed by the U.S. G overnment's National Institute of Standards and Technology along with the sensitivity of the systems and the potential severity of the associated risks to MetLife and its relevant lines of business, and is managed by MetLife's CISO, collaborating with lines of business and corporate functions. Our Board of Directors oversees the Program.\n\nThe key features of the Program include:\n\n- A cybersecurity incident response team under the CISO's direction, which is responsible for monitoring and responding to threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.\n- An incident response plan that is managed by the CISO and the Chief Privacy Officer and tested through cross-functional annual exercises in various geographical regions of the Company, many of which include participation from senior executives and the Board of Directors.\n- Information security policies and procedures that are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect applicable changes in law, technology, practice and emerging threats.\n- Regular network and application testing and surveillance.\n- Periodic review of threats, vulnerabilities and other cybersecurity risks, internal and ex ternal.\n- Risk mitigation strategies, including annual internal and third-party risk assessments, as well as cybersecurity and privacy liability insurance intended to defray costs associated with an information security breach.\n- Vendor management procedures designed to identify and address potential risks associated with the use of third-party service providers.\n- Employee training programs on information security, data security, and cybersecurity practices and protection of data against cyber threats, at least annually.\n- A cross-functional approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, with participation from  G lobal  Technology &amp;  Operations,  Risk,  Compliance,  Legal,  Privacy and Internal Audit functions.\n\nWe exercise risk-based due diligence in selecting our third-party service providers, including, as appropriate, review of vendor applications, general IT controls and the IT facilities used to service MetLife's business. Third parties are governed by the MetLife Third-Party Risk Management program, which includes risk assessment prior to onboarding. Based on the assessment of risk, certain third-party service providers must periodically update relevant assessment documentation and be reevaluated by MetLife relative to their internal controls. V endors deemed critical and high risk are continuously monitored by various industry solutions and services designed to identify cybersecurity risks.\n\nWe also work with third parties, such as independent assessors (for example, for industry maturity assessments, penetration testing, application security reviews, and independent audits), external legal counsel and other consultants as part of the design and implementation of the Program. The Program is periodically evaluated by external experts, and the results of those reviews are reported to the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, we have not identified risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect MetLife, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For further discussion of MetLife's risks related to cybersecurity, see 'Risk Factors - Operational Risks - We May Fail to Protect the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of Our Systems or Data, Including As a Result of a Failure in Our Cybersecurity or Other Information Security Systems or Our Disaster Recovery Plans or Those of Our Vendors.'",

      "question": "How did AIG's treatment of homeowners' insurance within its personal lines portfolio evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of short-tail risk management and its impact on undiscounted incurred losses?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AIG described its U.S. Personal Insurance segment as including homeowners' insurance under short-tail personal lines, with notable salvage and subrogation recoveries. By 2024, the UK/Europe and Japan Personal Insurance segment maintained homeowners' insurance within personal lines but placed increased emphasis on the short-tail nature of these portfolios, particularly in relation to undiscounted incurred losses net of reinsurance. This suggests a strategic sharpening of focus on managing short-duration claims, likely to improve loss predictability and recoveries, which were highlighted in both years as key characteristics of personal lines, but with more explicit linkage to loss management in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife's RMBS portfolio was broadly diversified by security type, including both collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. By 2024, the company's estimated fair value of pass-through mortgage-backed securities increased slightly from $12.392 billion to $12.567 billion, but the net unrealized losses on these securities also increased significantly from $(1,114) million to $(1,294) million. This indicates that while the company maintained a relatively stable position in pass-through securities, the market valuation pressures on these assets intensified over the two-year period, contributing to greater unrealized losses despite a slight rise in fair value.",

Our investment selection criteria and monitoring include review of credit ratings, characteristics of the assets underlying the securities, borrower characteristics and the level of credit enhancement. We held $63.7 billion and $56.3 billion of Structured Products at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS sections below.\n\n## RMBS\n\nOur RMBS portfolio is broadly diversified by security type and risk profile.\n\nOn a security type basis, RMBS includes collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\n\nOn a risk profile basis, RMBS includes Agency and Non-Agency securities. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association,  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  or  G overnment  National  Mortgage  Association.  Non-Agency  securities  include  prime,  prime investor,  non-qualified  residential  mortgage  ('NQM'),  and  alternative  residential  mortgage  loans  ('Alt-A'),  and  reperforming  and  sub-prime  mortgage-backed securities. Prime (owner-occupied) and prime investor (non-owner-occupied) loans were originated to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. NQM and Alt-A are classifications of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime.  Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles, while reperforming loans were previously delinquent that returned to performing status.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife categorized certain separate accounts invested in assets with little or no price transparency\u2014such as private equity and real estate funds\u2014as part of the Level 3 asset category, which relies on unobservable inputs for valuation. By 2024, the company continued to report separate accounts under Level 3 when they were invested in alternative asset classes that lacked frequent trading activity and required additional time to liquidate. The continued use of Level 3 classification for these separate accounts indicates that MetLife maintained its exposure to alternative investments with limited price transparency, suggesting a consistent strategy in long-term asset allocation despite market uncertainties. This evolution shows a stable approach to managing pension and postretirement benefit plan assets through complex, illiquid investments.",

The Level 2 asset category includes certain separate accounts that are primarily invested in liquid and readily marketable securities. The estimated fair value of such separate accounts is based upon reported NAV  provided by fund managers and this value represents the amount at which transfers into and out of the respective separate account are effected. These separate accounts provide reasonable levels of price transparency and can be corroborated through observable market data. Directly held investments are primarily invested in U.S. and foreign government and corporate securities. The Level 3 asset category includes separate accounts that are invested in assets that provide little or no price transparency due to the infrequency with which the underlying assets trade and generally require additional time to liquidate in an orderly manner.

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Business\n\n'MetLife' and the 'Company' refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. MetLife is one of the world's leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MetLife is organized into six segments: G roup Benefits; Retirement and Income Solutions ('RIS'); Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa ('EMEA'); and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate &amp; Other. See Note 2 for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate &amp; Other.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP') requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Company's business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities ('VIEs') for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\n\nThe Company uses either the equity method of accounting or the fair value option ('FVO') for its investments in real estate joint ventures ('REJV ') and other limited partnership interests ('OLPI') when it has more than a minor ownership interest or more than a minor influence over the investee's operations. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee's earnings in net investment income on a three-month lag in instances where the investee's financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee's reporting period differs from the Company's reporting period.\n\n## Held-for-Sale\n\nThe Company classifies a business as held-for-sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business, the sale is probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current estimated fair value and certain other specified criteria are met. The business classified as held-for-sale is recorded at the lower of the carrying value and estimated fair value, less cost to sell. If the carrying value of the business ex ceeds its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, a loss is recognized and reported in net investment gains (losses). If the estimated fair value subsequently increases prior to sale, a gain is recognized and reported in net investment gains (losses) but will not exceed the losses recognized since the business was classified as held-for-sale. Assets and liabilities related to the business classified as held-for-sale are separately reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheets in the period in which the business first meets all the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale and in each reporting period thereafter until sold. See Note 3. If a component of the Company has either been disposed of or is classified as heldfor-sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, the results of the component are reported in discontinued operations.\n\n## Separate Accounts\n\nSeparate accounts are established in conformity with insurance laws. G enerally, the assets of the separate accounts cannot be used to settle the liabilities that arise from any other business of the Company.

In the more recent incurral months, the credibility is higher on expected loss ratios and lower on claims calculated using the experience-derived factors. The credibility grows for the factors as incurral months become older.\n\nFor Protection Health products, claim duration can be very long due to the multiple incidences that may occur over time for a single claim. Depending on the characteristics of the product, the number of claims reported per year may or may not be based on the original claim occurrence date for each individual claim. For Protection Life products, claims are based upon individual death claims.\n\nThe assumptions used in calculating the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for Protection Life and Protection Health are updated annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience.\n\nCertain  of  the  Protection  Life  customers  have  ex perience-rated  contracts,  whereby  the  group  sponsor  participates  in  the  favorable  and/or  adverse  claim experience, including favorable and/or adverse prior year development.

Future Policy Benefits (continued)\n\n## Significant Methodologies and Assumptions\n\nFor Group Life, the IBNR liability is determined by using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method, with factors derived by examining the experience of historical claims. A pending liability is also calculated for claims that have been reported but have not been paid. A claim eligibility ratio based on past ex perience is applied to the face amount of individual claims.\n\nFor Group Disability, the IBNR liability is calculated by applying a percentage to premiums in-force based on the expected delay as evidenced by the experience in the portfolio. The IBNR liability is then allocated back into different incurral years based on historical run-off patterns. As the benefit for this class of business is a regular series of payments, an additional reserve is required for the liability for ongoing benefit payments - claims in course of payment ('CICP'). The assumptions employed in the calculation of the CICP are adjusted for the Company's own experience.\n\nAn expense liability is held for the future expenses associated with the payment of incurred but not yet paid claims. This is expressed as a percentage of the underlying claims liability and is based on past ex perience and the future ex pense structure.\n\nThe assumptions used in calculating the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for  G roup  Disability and  G roup  Life are updated annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience.\n\nNo additional premiums or return premiums have been accrued as a result of the prior year development.\n\nThe liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment ex penses were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were discounted using interest rates ranging from 1% to 7%, based on the incurral year. The total discount applied to these liabilities was $166 million and $163 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amount of interest accretion recognized was $44 million, $37 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were reflected in policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nThe Company tracks claim frequency by the number of reported claims as identified by a unique claim number assigned to individual claimants. Claim counts include claims that do not ultimately result in a liability. A liability is only established for those claims that are ex pected to result in a liability, based on historical factors.\n\n## Latin America\n\nProtection Life\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife reported $1,011 million in total unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, indicating a significant reliance on reinsurance to manage liabilities. This reinsurance strategy extended to their exposure to variable annuity guarantees, which include living and death benefit features that pose financial risk during volatile market conditions. In 2024, the company recorded a $476 million change in estimated fair values and earned income of derivatives hedging these guarantees, down from $596 million in 2023, suggesting a reduced but still substantial financial impact from these liabilities. The evolution of this chain indicates that the 2023 reinsurance framework helped shape the 2024 financial exposure by mitigating some of the risk associated with variable annuity guarantees, as evidenced by the decline in hedging-related losses.",

      "question": "How did the impact of adverse market conditions on AXP's liquidity and capital access evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what role did operational risk management play in shaping the company's resilience strategies across this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AXP faced heightened operational risks tied to data governance, third-party management, and regulatory compliance, which exposed the company to potential disruptions in its control environment and reputational harm. These risks were compounded by increasing regulatory scrutiny around privacy and cybersecurity, which could have restricted AXP\u2019s ability to operate efficiently in international markets. By 2024, AXP was directly impacted by adverse market conditions that affected its access to capital markets, securitization funding, and liquidity, especially under stress scenarios. The company\u2019s ability to manage dividends and repurchase shares was constrained by regulatory requirements tied to stress testing and capital adequacy. The evolution from operational risk exposure in 2022 to direct macroeconomic challenges in 2024 shows that AXP\u2019s resilience strategies had to shift from internal control strengthening to external risk mitigation, particularly around funding stability and regulatory capital planning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AXP(2022) \u2192 Operational Risk: AXP identified significant operational risks related to data governance, third-party compliance, and internal controls, which could lead to regulatory penalties and reputational damage.",
        "Hop 2: Operational Risk \u2192 Adverse Market Conditions: Operational failures can exacerbate vulnerabilities during adverse market conditions, such as increased regulatory scrutiny or liquidity constraints.",
        "Hop 3: Adverse Market Conditions \u2190 AXP(2024): AXP faced direct impacts from adverse market conditions, including higher funding costs, reduced access to capital markets, and restrictions on capital distributions due to regulatory stress testing requirements."

Our failure to comply with such laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security in the United States, the EU and various other countries in which we operate.\n\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see 'Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security' under 'Supervision and Regulation.'\n\n## We may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\n\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party's compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third parties. As processes or organizations are changed, or new products and services are introduced, such as new lending features, debit products and checking accounts, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm to customers, legal liability, fines, sanctions, customer remediation and brand damage.\n\nCompliance risk arises from violations of, or failure to conform or comply with, laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and ethical standards. We need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks. Operational and compliance failures, deficiencies in our control environment or an inability to maintain an ethical workplace and high standards of business conduct can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations.\n\n## If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our products, systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages.\n\n## Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\n\nNew tax legislative initiatives, including increases in the corporate tax rate, are currently being considered and may be enacted. In addition, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) could have an impact on how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits. These potential changes could adversely impact our effective tax rate, our tax positions and tax liabilities. In addition, actions by tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities.",

          "chunk_text": "Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorganChase's earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies, including where declining industrial or manufacturing activ ity has resulted in or could result in higher lev els of unemployment, or where high lev els of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.\n\nJPMorganChase's earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by gov ernmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:\n\n- policies and initiativ es relating to medical insurance, education, immigration and housing, or that may impact employment status\n- laws, rules and regulations relating specifically to the financial serv ices industry, such as limitations on late payment, ov erdraft and interchange fees, and\n- policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation, which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.\n\n## Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase's wholesale businesses.\n\nIn JPMorganChase's wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the v olume of transactions that JPMorganChase executes for its clients or for which it adv ises clients, and, therefore, the rev enue that JPMorganChase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and inv estors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorganChase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorganChase's businesses engaged in capital markets activ ities, including loan syndication, securities underwriting and lev eraged lending activ ities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:\n\n- earn less fee rev enue due to lower transaction v olumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfav orable market conditions, or\n- dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at fav orable prices.\n\nThe fees that JPMorganChase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset v alues or other adv erse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the v aluation of client assets that JPMorganChase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorganChase's rev enue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adv erse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorganChase funds or accounts, or cause clients to inv est in products that generate lower rev enue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorganChase fund can also hamper the inv estment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadv antageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker inv estment performance.\n\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, sev ere declines in commercial real estate values, or sustained changes in consumer behav ior that affect specific economic sectors, could hav e a material adv erse effect on clients of JPMorganChase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorganChase could incur credit losses on its loans and other commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is or comes under stress.\n\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behav ior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also hav e a negativ e impact on certain of JPMorganChase's wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorganChase's earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorganChase's wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties, including offices, which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adv erse economic conditions or hybrid work models could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or dev elopers receiv e from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the v alues of the properties, impair the ability of borrowers to serv ice or refinance their commercial real estate loans and lead to an increase in foreclosures. These consequences could result in JPMorganChase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for serv icing a larger v olume of delinquent loans in that portfolio. An increase in foreclosures could result in higher operational risk associated with JPMorganChase owning and managing real property,",

Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. We are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the stress capital buffer, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\n\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our preferred stock.\n\nWe rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and such dividends may be limited by law, regulation or supervisory policy. For example, AENB is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\n\nAny future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see 'Supervision and Regulation - Stress Testing and Capital Planning' and '- Dividends and Other Capital Distributions' under 'Business,' as well as 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity - Dividends and Share Repurchases' under 'MD&amp;A' and Note 22 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.'\n\n## Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flex ibility. Additional factors affecting the ex tent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets.\n\n## Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations.\n\nDuring 2024, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nPolitical and economic conditions could continue to cause changes in the values of currencies and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our net revenues. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members' currency can also affect their ability to make payment to us. Foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them and the availability of foreign exchange could further impact our results of operations.\n\n## An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. Additionally, a decrease in confidence in the soundness of us or in the banking sector more broadly, such as following the occurrence of bank failures, or in the level of insurance available on deposits may cause rapid deposit withdrawals or an unwillingness to maintain deposits with us,",

      "question": "How did the changes in Visa's Class B common stock structure between 2023 and 2024, including the exchange offer and redenomination, impact the number of outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock, and what does this indicate about Visa's strategy regarding liquidity and shareholder rights?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Visa had 622 million shares of Class B-1 common stock outstanding. Following the redenomination and exchange offer in early 2024, 241 million Class B-1 shares were retired in exchange for 120 million Class B-2 shares and 48 million Class C shares. By September 30, 2024, the total Class B common stock (including both B-1 and B-2) had decreased to 125 million shares from 245 million in 2023. Meanwhile, Class A common stock increased from 1,594 shares in 2023 to 1,733 shares in 2024. This indicates that Visa is strategically reducing restrictions on its capital structure, increasing liquidity by converting non-tradable Class B shares into tradable Class C shares, and aligning shareholder rights by increasing the freely tradable portion of equity. The voting rights tied to Class A shares and the lack of voting rights for Class B and C shares suggest a continued emphasis on maintaining control among existing Class A shareholders while offering more liquidity to others.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: V(2023) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: In 2023, Visa disclosed 622 million Class B-1 shares and outlined the conditions under which Class B shares could convert to Class A, including transfer to non-Visa Members and conversion rate adjustments.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The conversion mechanism links Class B shares to Class A shares through a defined rate that adjusts based on litigation escrow activity and final resolution, impacting the voting and economic rights of shareholders.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 V(2024): By 2024, the number of Class B shares had significantly decreased due to the exchange offer, while Class A shares slightly increased, reflecting a strategic shift toward reducing restrictions and increasing liquidity."

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife offered customized structured settlements as part of its annuity product suite, specifically designed to serve as alternatives to lump-sum payments in legal claims, with guaranteed payments including life-contingent and certain annuities (MET_10k_2023.pdf:page_8:chunk_2). These structured settlements were explicitly grouped under the RIS segment\u2019s annuity products, which were primarily single-premium, spread-based contracts that contributed to the company's future policy benefit liabilities (MET_10k_2023.pdf:page_179:chunk_1). By 2024, MetLife continued to produce annuity products, including those with similar guaranteed payout structures, indicating a strategic continuity in leveraging structured settlements to support long-term liability management. The inclusion of structured settlements in the annuity mix likely contributed to more stable future policy benefit liabilities due to their predictable payout schedules and low surrender rates, as seen in the 2023 disclosures. This evolution reflects a deliberate alignment of structured settlement design with broader annuity product performance and risk transfer objectives.",

      "question": "Schwab appears to have increased its use of secured uncommitted lines of credit from 2022 to 2023, particularly through TDAC and CS&Co. How does this shift relate to the company's broader short-term liquidity strategy, especially given the $700 million drawn by TDAC in 2023 and the $950 million borrowed by CS&Co under similar facilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TDAC maintained secured uncommitted lines of credit and pledged client margin securities as collateral, though no balance was outstanding at year-end. By 2023, TDAC had $700 million outstanding under these facilities, while CS&Co had $950 million outstanding under secured, uncommitted lines backed by either client margin or firm securities. This increase reflects Schwab's strategic shift toward leveraging client margin securities to support short-term liquidity needs, particularly amid growing margin loan balances and regulatory liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirements. The company appears to be optimizing its liquidity framework by expanding secured borrowing capacity, aligning with its compliance with the full LCR rule that began in October 2021 and continued into 2023.",

        "Hop 2: TDAC \u2192 Secured Uncommitted Lines of Credit: TDAC relied on secured, uncommitted credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs, particularly in response to margin loan growth and LCR compliance.",

      "question": "How did the amortization of the deferred gain from AIG's adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the ongoing financial impact of the collateral trust account established by NICO?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the amortization of the deferred gain from AIG's adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO was $189 million. By 2024, this amount had increased significantly to $322 million, indicating a growing financial benefit to AIG from the retroactive reinsurance agreement. This increase suggests that the settlement period of the ceded reserves has progressed, allowing for more of the deferred gain to be recognized. The collateral trust account established by NICO in 2017, funded with the consideration paid under the agreement, provided security for NICO's claim payment obligations to AIG, enabling the amortization process to continue over time. The parental guarantee from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. further supported the stability of this arrangement, allowing AIG to realize increasing gains over the years as the deferred gain was amortized into income.",

For these agreements, the excess of the amounts ultimately collectible under the agreement over the consideration paid is recognized as a deferred gain liability and amortized into income over the settlement period of the ceded reserves. The amount of the deferral is recalculated each period based on loss payments and updated estimates. If the consideration paid exceeds the ultimate losses collectible under the agreement, the net loss on the agreement is recognized in income immediately. Ceded loss reserves under retroactive agreements were $16.8 billion and $18.9 billion, and the deferred gain liability was $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effect on income from amortization of the deferred gain was $191 million, $237 million and $219 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO's obligations under the agreement.\n\n## LONG-DURATION REINSURANCE\n\nLong-duration reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term (YRT) treaties, along with a large modco treaty with a former affiliate, Fortitude Re, that was deconsolidated following the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale. This modco treaty reinsures the majority of our long-duration run-off business. The premiums with respect to YRT treaties are earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection provided, while ceded premiums related to modco treaties are recognized when due. Amounts recoverable on YRT treaties are recognized when claims are incurred on the reinsured policies and are presented as a component of reinsurance assets. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers related to coinsurance or modco contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are presented as a component of Reinsurance assets.\n\n234 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, V's capital structure included Class B common stock with 33\u2153% non-dilutable voting power, granting it separate approval rights over material transactions such as mergers, asset sales, and amendments to corporate governance documents. This structure gave the holder of Class B shares (Brian L. Roberts) significant influence over corporate decisions, even if opposed by other shareholders. By 2024, V disclosed that Class B-1, B-2, and C common stock would become convertible into Class A common stock, with full convertibility of Series B and C preferred stock no later than 2028, subject to litigation-related holdbacks. This planned convertibility introduces potential dilution of existing Class A voting power and creates misaligned incentives between Class B/C holders and Class A stockholders, as the former may not support transactions favorable to the latter. The evolution from concentrated voting rights in 2022 to the 2024 convertibility plan suggests a transition in governance dynamics, where future material transactions may face additional complexity due to diverging interests and the potential for increased shareholder influence from newly converted Class A shares.",

If  we  are  unable  to  reach  agreement  with  a  labor  union  before  the  expiration  of  a  collective  bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.\n\nIn  addition,  NBCUniversal's Media segment and Sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.\n\nOur Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced  below  9,444,375,  which  was  the  number  of  shares  of  Class  B  common  stock  outstanding  on  the  date  of  our  2002 acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp.'s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets)  or  issuances  of  securities  that  require  shareholder  approval,  transactions  that  result  in  any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles  of  incorporation  or  by-laws  that  would  limit  the  rights  of  holders  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Brian  L.  Roberts,  our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium. 1\n\n## Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 2: Properties\n\nWe believe that substantially all of our physical assets were in good operating condition as of December 31, 2021. Our corporate headquarters and Cable Communications segment headquarters are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at One Comcast Center. Additionally, the Comcast Technology Center, which is adjacent to the Comcast Center, is a center for Cable Communications' technology and engineering workforce, as well as the home of our NBCUniversal and Telemundo owned local broadcast stations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We also have leases for numerous business offices, warehouses and properties throughout the United States that house divisional information technology operations.\n\n## Cable Communications Segment\n\nOur  principal  physical  assets  consist  of  operating  plant  and  equipment,  including  cable  system  signal  receiving,  encoding  and decoding devices, headends and distribution networks. Our distribution network consists primarily of headends, content distribution servers,  coaxial  and  fiber-optic  cables,  lasers,  routers,  switches  and  related  electronic  equipment.  Our  cable  plant  and  related equipment generally are connected to utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities, although in some areas the  distribution  cable  is  buried  in  underground  ducts  or  trenches.  The  physical  components  of  cable  systems  require  periodic maintenance and replacement.\n\nOur cable system signal reception sites, which consist primarily of antenna towers and headends, and our microwave facilities are located on owned and leased parcels of land, and we own or lease space on the towers on which certain of our equipment is located.

T he series B and series C preferred stock will become fully conv ertible to series A preferred stock or class A common stock no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cov er any pending claims). Conv ersion of our class B-1, B-2 and C common stock into class A common stock, or our series A, B and C preferred stock into class A common stock, would increase the amount of class A common stock outstanding, which would dilute the v oting power of existing class A common stockholders. In addition, the sale of significant portions of conv erted class A common stock could adv ersely impact the market price of our existing class A common stock.\n\n## Holders of our class B-1, B-2 and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock may have different interests than our class A common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions.\n\nAlthough their v oting rights are limited, holders of our class B-1, B-2 and C common stock and, in certain specified circumstances, holders of our series A,  B  and  C  preferred  stock,  can  v ote  on  certain  significant  transactions.  With  respect  to  our  class  B-1,  B-2  and  C  common  stock,  these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other v ote required under Delaware law .

Because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class A common stock are our current and former financial institution clients, they may hav e interests that div erge from our class A common stockholders. As a result, the holders of these classes of capital stock may not hav e the same incentiv e to approv e a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class A common stockholders.\n\n## Delaware law, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could make a merger, takeover attempt or change in control difficult.\n\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prev ent a merger, takeov er attempt or change in control that our stockholders may consider fav orable.

In early 2024, AIG announced the full redemption of all 20,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the 20,000,000 corresponding Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a preferred share, at a redemption price of $25.00 per Depositary Share. This 2024 announcement, disclosed in the 2023 10-K filing, signaled a structural change in the Depositary Shares, transitioning them from an active financial instrument to one slated for termination.

By 2024, the estimated fair value of Repurchase Agreements slightly decreased to $3,019 million, while their contribution to the Reinvestment Portfolio increased to $2,925 million.

      "question": "How did Mastercard's strategic response to digital currencies as a competitive threat evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of blockchain-based solutions like the Mastercard Multi-Token Network\u2122 and the increase in tokenized transactions to 30%?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Mastercard acknowledged digital currencies as a competitive threat that could disrupt traditional financial markets and potentially compete with its existing products and services. By 2024, the company shifted toward proactive integration of blockchain-based solutions, exemplified by initiatives like the Mastercard Multi-Token Network\u2122, aimed at enabling programmable payments and improving interoperability within blockchain ecosystems. This strategic pivot was accompanied by measurable progress in digital payment adoption, such as 30% of all Mastercard transactions becoming tokenized and 70% of in-person transactions being contactless. The shift reflects a transformation from viewing digital currencies primarily as a threat to actively building infrastructure to support and secure emerging blockchain-based business models.",

      "question": "How did MetLife's implementation of LDTI in 2023 influence the structure of disaggregated rollforwards disclosed in 2024, particularly in terms of the reclassification of MRB liabilities and its impact on retained earnings?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife implemented LDTI, which required a full retrospective approach for Market Risk Benefits (MRBs), leading to the reclassification of amounts previously recorded under additional insurance liabilities, embedded derivatives, and other insurance liabilities directly to MRB liabilities. This reclassification also resulted in adjustments to retained earnings and AOCI, particularly due to the cumulative effect of changes in nonperformance risk. LDTI further mandated separate disaggregated rollforwards for additional insurance liabilities and traditional/limited-payment future policy benefits (FPBs), which directly influenced how MetLife structured its 2024 disclosures. In 2024, MetLife disclosed disaggregated rollforwards of separate account liabilities, grouping products based on common characteristics and valuation methodologies, reflecting the structural changes initiated under LDTI in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET(2023) \u2192 LDTI: MetLife applied the full retrospective transition approach under LDTI, reclassifying MRB-related liabilities and adjusting retained earnings and AOCI.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MA disclosed that Class B common stock had no established public trading market and carried limited voting rights, with holders only able to vote on specific defined matters. This governance structure, where Class B shareholders had minimal influence over corporate decisions, allowed MA to pursue a more aggressive share repurchase strategy focused on Class A shares in 2024. By December 31, 2024, MA had spent $71,431 million on treasury stock related to Class A shares, reducing the number of Class A shares outstanding from 927 million to 907 million year-over-year.

      "answer": "In 2023, Bank of America invested in CDOs, which are hybrid instruments that include embedded derivatives. These instruments expose the firm to credit risk, where a credit event may result in partial repayment of principal. By 2024, the Corporation reported net gains (or losses) in market making and similar activities that relate to embedded derivatives in structured liabilities, which were typically offset by gains (or losses) on derivatives and securities used to hedge these liabilities. The evolution from a direct investment in CDOs in 2023 to the recognition of structured liability-related gains or losses in 2024 suggests a temporal shift in how the Corporation managed or realized risk associated with these complex instruments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG's U.S. Personal Insurance segment explicitly highlighted the use of frequency/severity, loss development, and IBNR factor methods for short-tail lines like personal property and personal auto, with a specific mention of significant salvage and subrogation recoveries influencing reserving accuracy. By 2024, the UK/Europe and Japan Personal Insurance segment reaffirmed the short-tail nature of personal lines, including extended warranty, but did not quantify salvage or subrogation impacts. The absence of explicit subrogation recovery figures in 2024 suggests a shift in reporting focus, despite maintaining similar reserving methodologies. This indicates a potential evolution in how AIG assessed or prioritized recoveries in different geographies over time.",

Accident and health products include voluntary and sponsor-paid personal accident and supplemental health products for individuals, employees, associations and other organizations as well as a broad range of travel insurance products and services for leisure and business travelers. Personal lines include automobile and homeowners' insurance, extended warranty, and consumer specialty products, such as identity theft and credit card protection. Personal lines also provides insurance for high net worth individuals offered through AIG Private Client Group, including auto, homeowners, umbrella, yacht, fine art and collections insurance. Personal lines are generally short-tail in nature and can reflect significant salvage and subrogation recoveries.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by line of business and may separately review various sub-segments, such as specific accident and health products and property damage versus liability for personal lines products.\n\nFrequency/severity methods, loss development methods, and IBNR factor methods are used alone or in combination to set reserves for short-tail product lines such as personal property.\n\nFrequency/severity and loss development methods are utilized for domestic personal auto product lines.\n\nFor these classes of business, reliance is placed on frequency/severity methods as claim counts emerge quickly for personal auto. Frequency/severity methods allow for more immediate analysis of resulting loss trends and comparisons to industry and other diagnostic metrics. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques.\n\n## UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $210 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by recognition of large loss activity in Financial PI in the UK and Commercial D&amp;O in Europe.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $258 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by Financial Lines in the UK and Europe and Excess Casualty in Europe as we continue to see increased severity of large losses in these classes.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $161 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by increased large loss activity in recent accident years, particularly related to UK directors and officers class action suits against insureds with global exposure, and increased frequency and severity in European casualty for auto liability and employers liability. This was slightly offset by a benefit from an increase in the Ogden rates in the UK used to value long duration claims.\n\n274 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did MetLife's use of matrix pricing for foreign government securities evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of observable market inputs like benchmark yields and broker quotes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife used matrix pricing for foreign government securities, relying on benchmark yields, issuer spreads, and broker-dealer quotations as key inputs under the market approach. By 2024, the company continued to apply matrix pricing but shifted toward greater reliance on independent non-binding broker quotations and credit spreads, indicating a change in observable market inputs. This evolution suggests a potential decrease in market liquidity or transparency for these securities between the years, as reflected in the MET filings and contextualized by the matrix pricing methodology described in the MO 2022 filing.",

        "Hop 1: MET(2022) \u2192 Matrix Pricing: MetLife disclosed its use of matrix pricing for fair value measurements, including foreign government securities, in its 2022 10-K filing.",
        "Hop 2: Matrix Pricing \u2192 Foreign Government Securities: The MO 2022 filing explains that matrix pricing, along with yield curves and indices, is used when broker quotes aren't available for valuing foreign government securities.",
        "Hop 3: MET(2024) \u2190 Foreign Government Securities: The 2024 filing shows MetLife's continued use of matrix pricing for foreign government securities but with a different set of observable inputs, including more emphasis on non-binding broker quotes and credit spreads."

Fair Value (continued)\n\n- (4) Derivative assets are presented within other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheets and derivative liabilities are presented within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are presented gross in the tables above to reflect the presentation on the consolidated balance sheets, but are presented net for purposes of the rollforward in the Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) tables.\n- (5) Embedded derivatives within asset host contracts are presented within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets. Embedded derivatives within liability host contracts are presented within policyholder account balances and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n- (6) Investment performance related to separate account assets is fully offset by corresponding amounts  credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected within separate account liabilities. Separate account liabilities are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets. Separate account liabilities presented in the tables above represent derivative liabilities.\n- (7) Total assets included in the fair value hierarchy exclude other limited partnership interests that are measured at estimated fair value using the net asset value ('NAV') per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value of such investments was $99 million and $75 million, respectively.\n\nThe following describes the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.\n\n## Investments\n\n## Securities, Short-term Investments and Other Investments\n\nWhen available, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company's securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management's judgment.\n\nWhen quoted prices in active markets are not available, the determination of estimated fair value of securities is based on market standard valuation methodologies, giving priority to observable inputs. The significant inputs to the market standard valuation  methodologies  for  certain  types  of  securities  with  reasonable  levels  of  price  transparency  are  inputs  that  are observable  in  the  market  or  can  be  derived  principally  from,  or  corroborated  by,  observable  market  data. When  observable inputs are not available, the market standard valuation methodologies rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management's judgment or estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market activity. Unobservable inputs are based on management's assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing such investments.\n\nThe  estimated  fair  value  of  short-term  investments  and  other  investments  is  determined  on  a  basis  consistent  with  the methodologies described herein.\n\nThe valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair  value  hierarchy  are  presented  below. The  primary  valuation  approaches  are  the  market  approach,  which considers recent prices from market transactions involving identical or similar assets or liabilities, and the income approach, which  converts  expected  future  amounts  (e.g.  cash  flows)  to  a  single  current,  discounted  amount.  The  valuation  of  most instruments listed below is determined using independent pricing sources, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow methodologies or other similar techniques that use either observable market inputs or unobservable inputs.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, the conversion rate of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock was 1.6059, resulting in 394 million as-converted Class A shares. By 2023, the conversion rate had increased to 1.6228, raising the as-converted Class A shares to 398 million. In 2023, Visa implemented structural changes to its capital framework, including the redenomination of Class B shares to Class B-1 and the authorization of an exchange offer program that allowed holders to exchange portions of Class B-1 shares for freely tradeable Class C shares. Additionally, Visa introduced new classes of Class B common stock (e.g., Class B-2) with adjusted conversion rate impacts, which could influence future conversions depending on the resolution of U.S. covered litigation and escrow account adjustments.",

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, V had 245 million shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, which converted into 394 million shares of Class A Common Stock on an as-converted basis. By 2024, the number of Class B shares outstanding dropped to 125 million, while Class A shares increased to 1,733 million issued and outstanding. The conversion mechanism remained one-for-one, but the reduction in Class B shares indicates conversions occurred over this period. This shift contributed to a transformation in V's equity structure, with Class A shares becoming more dominant while Class B shares were reduced by half, signaling a move toward a more consolidated ownership base.",

        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis into Class A shares, although the as-converted amounts in 2022 reflect a conversion multiplier effect due to timing or valuation adjustments.",

      "question": "How did MA's share repurchase activity between 2023 and 2024 impact the relative ownership structure and equity value of Class A versus Class B shares, given the disparity in voting rights?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MA disclosed that the aggregate market value of Class A common stock held by non-affiliates was approximately $328.8 billion, with 925.7 million shares outstanding, while Class B common stock had no established public trading market and only 7.2 million shares outstanding. During the years 2023 and 2024, MA repurchased $62.2 billion and $62.0 billion worth of shares, respectively, primarily targeting Class A and Class C shares (which are economically equivalent to Class A but have no voting rights). By the end of 2024, MA\u2019s Class A treasury stock had increased to $71.4 billion from $60.4 billion in 2023, indicating significant Class A share retirements. This reduction in Class A shares outstanding (from 927 million in 2023 to 907 million in 2024) likely strengthened the relative voting power of Class B shares, which remained unchanged at 7 million shares. Therefore, MA's share repurchase strategy concentrated ownership and amplified the influence of Class B shareholders, who retain 10 votes per share compared to Class A's 1 vote per share.",

        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class A shares carry 1 vote per share, while Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 MA(2024): By 2024, MA had retired a significant portion of Class A shares through repurchases (from 927 million to 907 million), while Class B shares remained unchanged at 7 million, increasing the relative voting power of Class B shareholders."

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that its future policy benefit (FPB) reserves for long-term care insurance were calculated using actuarial assumptions that included morbidity, which encompasses the frequency and severity of claims, as well as claim incidence, utilization, and continuance. These assumptions were critical in estimating the present value of future benefits. In 2023, MetLife updated its biometric assumptions, noting an increase in incidence rates, which directly raised the expected cost of care and thus increased FPB reserves. This change reflects the direct influence of incidence \u2014 a core component of morbidity \u2014 on reserve levels, as originally framed in the 2022 disclosures. The increase in incidence rates in 2023, despite offsetting reductions in claim utilization experience, shows how evolving morbidity factors can materially affect reserve calculations over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  amounts  reported  on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  For  a  discussion  of  our significant  accounting  policies,  see  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  most  critical  estimates include those used in determining:\n\n- (i) liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n\n(ii) capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n\n(iii) estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n\n(iv) investment allowance for credit loss ('ACL') and impairments;\n\n(v) estimated  fair  values  of  freestanding  derivatives  and  the  recognition  and  estimated  fair  value  of  embedded  derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n\n(vi) measurement of goodwill and related impairment;\n\n(vii) measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n\n(viii) measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n\n(ix) liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed - the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Liability for Future Policy Benefits\n\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value  of  future  expected  benefits  to  be  paid,  reduced  by  the  present  value  of  future  expected  premiums.  Such  liabilities  are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions  used  in  the  establishment  of  liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  are  mortality,  morbidity,  policy  lapse,  renewal, retirement,  disability  incidence,  disability  terminations,  investment  returns,  inflation,  expenses  and  other  contingent  events  as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established  on  a  block  of  business  basis.  If  experience  is  less  favorable  than  assumed,  additional  liabilities  may  be  established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nFuture  policy  benefit  liabilities  for  disabled  lives  are  estimated  using  the  present  value  of  benefits  method  and  experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the  effects  of  current  developments,  anticipated  trends  and  risk  management  programs,  reduced  for  anticipated  salvage  and subrogation.\n\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation  period  based  on  total  expected  assessments.  Liabilities  for  ULSG  and  paid-up  guarantees  are  determined  by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits  ratably  over  the  accumulation  period  based  on  total  expected  assessments.  The  assumptions  used  in  estimating  the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index.\n\nWe  regularly  review  our  estimates  of  liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  and  compare  them  with  our  actual  experience. Differences  between  actual  experience  and  the  assumptions  used  in  pricing  these  policies  and  guarantees,  as  well  as  in  the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.",

          "chunk_text": "Our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either ERAC or UFLIC as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's launch of PYUSD in 2023 influence its custodial risk exposure and regulatory obligations in 2024, particularly in relation to third-party custodians?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PayPal identified operational disruption as a key risk, especially in the context of strategic transactions and third-party dependencies such as custodians (PYPL_10k_2023.pdf:page 27:chunk_1). The company specifically noted that operational disruptions at custodians could result in customer asset losses, reputational damage, and financial exposure (PYPL_10k_2023.pdf:page 20:chunk_1). In 2024, following the August 2023 launch of PYUSD, PayPal's 10-K filing highlighted an expanded dependency on custodian partners and the PYUSD Issuer, noting that financial and third-party risks related to cryptocurrency custody could expose the company to loss, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm (PYPL_10k_2024.pdf:page 18:chunk_1). The evolving regulatory landscape around stablecoins introduced additional compliance obligations, potential fines, and the need for operational changes, which directly increased PayPal\u2019s custodial risk exposure and regulatory costs in 2024.",

These PayPal and V enmo customers may, if provisioned for external transfers and subject to our sanctions and anti-money laundering controls, send PYUSD to external wallets not controlled by PayPal. The PYUSD Issuer may also allow institutional users to directly purchase PYUSD from the PYUSD Issuer (as per the PYUSD Issuer's stablecoin terms and conditions). The regulatory treatment of stablecoins is evolving and has drawn significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies around the world, including the SEC. There are uncertainties on how ongoing changes to federal, state, and international laws and regulations would apply to stablecoins in practice, and we and the PYUSD Issuer may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with any additional or changed requirement. If we or the PYUSD Issuer fail to comply with regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, penalties, and other consequences. In addition, we could face reputational harm through our relationship with the PYUSD Issuer if the PYUSD Issuer were to face regulatory scrutiny, PYUSD is deemed to be a security, or PYUSD is alleged to be used for transactions in connection with illicit or illegal activities.\n\nWe hold our customers' cryptocurrency assets through one or more third-party custodians. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodians, insufficient insurance coverage by a custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, a custodian's failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, a custodian's inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, the failure of the PYUSD Issuer to maintain sufficient reserve assets backing PYUSD and defaults on financial or performance obligations by a custodian, banks with which the  PYUSD  Issuer maintains reserve assets or counterparty financial institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and significantly harm our business, financial condition, and reputation.\n\nWe have selected custodian partners and the PYUSD Issuer, and may in the future select additional custodian partners and stablecoin issuing entities, that are subject  to  regulatory  oversight,  capital  requirements,  maintenance  of  audit  and  compliance  industry  certifications,  and  cybersecurity  procedures  and  policies. Nevertheless, any operational disruptions at any such custodian or issuer, or such custodians' or issuer's failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings (or reserve assets), could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce consumer confidence and materially impact our cryptocurrency product offerings and our operating results.\n\nCustodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of a custodian's bankruptcy. While other types of assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian's bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of a custodian's bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although we contractually require our custodians to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by a custodian, will be effective in preventing such assets from being treated as part of the custodian's estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers against a custodian's estate for our customers' cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.\n\n## Lending Regulation\n\nWe hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. Similarly, the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. may be subject to consumer credit legislation, licensing requirements, consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations. Increased global regulatory focus on shortterm installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products.\n\nConsumer Protection",

      "question": "How did MetLife's inclusion of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations in its pension plan assets in 2023 relate to the growth of its broader RMBS portfolio in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife disclosed that its pension plan assets included Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) as part of its Structured Products investments, which totaled $56.3 billion. CMOs are specifically noted as a component of the RMBS portfolio, which includes both CMOs and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. By 2024, MetLife's total Structured Products holdings increased to $63.7 billion, with the RMBS segment continuing to include CMOs as a core component. This suggests that the company's prior exposure to CMOs in pension assets may have informed or aligned with its broader RMBS strategy, contributing to the portfolio's growth and structure in the following year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET(2023) \u2192 Collateralized Mortgage Obligations: MET disclosed in its 2023 pension plan assets that CMOs were included as part of Level 3 fair value investments.",

Our investment selection criteria and monitoring include review of credit ratings, characteristics of the assets underlying the securities, borrower characteristics and the level of credit enhancement. We held $63.7 billion and $56.3 billion of Structured Products at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS sections below.\n\n## RMBS\n\nOur RMBS portfolio is broadly diversified by security type and risk profile.\n\nOn a security type basis, RMBS includes collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\n\nOn a risk profile basis, RMBS includes Agency and Non-Agency securities. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association,  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  or  G overnment  National  Mortgage  Association.  Non-Agency  securities  include  prime,  prime investor,  non-qualified  residential  mortgage  ('NQM'),  and  alternative  residential  mortgage  loans  ('Alt-A'),  and  reperforming  and  sub-prime  mortgage-backed securities. Prime (owner-occupied) and prime investor (non-owner-occupied) loans were originated to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. NQM and Alt-A are classifications of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime.  Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles, while reperforming loans were previously delinquent that returned to performing status.",

The 2024 GS filing highlighted that the BSA had been expanded by the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which introduced a risk-based compliance approach, required periodic anti-money laundering priorities (e.g., cybercrime, corruption, terrorist financing), and mandated new standards for testing technology and internal processes for compliance. By 2024, MA had updated its compliance framework to reflect these expanded BSA obligations, including enhanced risk assessments and updated internal controls.

          "chunk_text": "The E.U. and the U.K. have each also introduced investment firm regimes, including  rules  regulating  compensation  for  certain  persons  providing services to certain investment funds.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations\n\nThe  U.S.  Bank  Secrecy  Act,  as  amended  (BSA),  including  by  the  USA PATRIOT  Act  of  2001  and  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Act  of  2020 (AMLA), contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and authorizes or mandates  the  promulgation  of various regulations applicable  to  financial  institutions,  including  standards  for  verifying  client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions  and  report  suspicious  activities.  Through  these  and  other provisions, the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote the identification of parties that may  be involved in terrorism,  money laundering or other suspicious activities.\n\nThe AMLA was intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money  laundering  laws.  Among  other  things,  the  AMLA  codifies  a risk-based  approach  to  anti-money  laundering  compliance  for  financial institutions;  requires  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  to  periodically promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for BSA  compliance;  expands enforcementand investigation-related authority,  including  a  significant  expansion  in  the  available  sanctions  for certain  BSA  violations;  and  expands  BSA  whistleblower  incentives  and protections. Certain statutory provisions in the AMLA require rulemakings beyond those that have already been finalized, reports and other measures. The  impact  of  the  AMLA  will  depend  on,  among  other  things,  these additional rulemakings and implementation guidance. The Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network  (FinCEN),  a  bureau  of  the  U.S.  Department  of Treasury, has issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering  the  financing  of  terrorism,  as  required  under  the AMLA.  The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking organization activity, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\n\n24 Goldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nThe  Corporate  Transparency Act (CTA) was enacted in 2021 as part of the  AMLA  and  designed  to  establish  beneficial  ownership  information reporting requirements for certain types of entities, and in 2024, FinCEN's rule implementing the reporting requirements of the CTA  became effective. Under the rule, domestic companies formed before 2024 would be  required  to  file  their  initial  report  by  January  1,  2025  and  domestic companies  formed  in  or  after  2024  would  be  required  to  file  their  initial report within, respectively, 90 or 30 days of their formation, in each case subject to certain exemptions. On February 19, 2025, FinCEN announced that the earliest initial reporting deadline is March 21, 2025.\n\nIn 2024, FinCEN and the SEC proposed a rule that would require certain investment  advisers  to  implement  reasonable  procedures  to  identify  and verify  the  identities  of  their  customers.  In  2024,  FinCEN  proposed  to amend  the  anti-money  laundering/countering  the  financing  of  terrorism (AML/CFT) program requirements for all financial  institutions  subject  to the  BSA  that  have  AML/CFT  program  obligations,  including  us.  The proposal  would,  among  other  things,  require  a  financial  institution's  risk assessment  process  to  identify,  evaluate  and  document  the  financial institution's  money  laundering,  terrorist  financing  and  other  illicit  activity risks, and update such risk assessments on a periodic basis. In 2024, the U.S.  federal  bank  regulatory  agencies  proposed  amendments  to  their respective  BSA  program  rules  to  align  those  rules  with  the  FinCEN proposal.  FinCEN has also adopted a rule, effective on  January 1, 2026, that  includes  certain  investment  advisers,  such  as  us,  in  the  definition  of 'financial  institutions'  under  FinCEN's  rules  implementing  the  BSA  and, among other things, prescribes minimum standards for  AML/CFT programs to be established by such investment advisers and requires them to report suspicious activity to FinCEN.\n\nWe are  subject  to  other  laws  and  regulations  worldwide  relating  to  antimoney  laundering  and  financial  transparency,  including  the  E.U.  AntiMoney  Laundering  Directives.  In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (FCPA),  the  U.K.  Bribery  Act  and  other laws and regulations worldwide regarding corrupt and illegal payments, or providing  anything  of  value,  for  the  benefit  of  government  officials  and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to the identification  of  clients,  monitoring  for  and  reporting suspicious transactions, monitoring direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, providing information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and sharing information with other financial institutions.",

Some governments have  taken  acEon  to  provide  resources,  preferenEal  treatment  or  other  protecEon  to  selected domesEc payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own naEonal providers.  For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domesEc payments either enErely in that country or by only domesEc companies.  Some jurisdicEons are currently considering adopEng or have adopted data l oca l i za Eon requirements, which mandate the collecEon, storage, and/or other processing of data within their borders.

We are subject to anE-money laundering ('AML') and countering the financing of terrorism ('CFT') laws and regulaEons globally, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic s a ncEons  programs,  including  those  imposed  and  administered  by  the  U.S.  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  ('OFAC')  and  the  European  Union.  We  have i mplemented a comprehensive  AML/CFT program, comprised of policies,  procedures  and  internal  controls,  including  the  designaEon  of  a  compliance  officer, which is  designed  to  prevent  our  payments  network  from  being  used  to  facilitate  money  laundering  and  other  illicit  acEvity  and  to  address  these  legal  and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

We  take  measures  to  prevent  transacEons  that  do  not  comply  with  OFAC  and  other  applicable s a ncEons,  including  establishing  a  risk-based  compliance  program  that  has  policies,  procedures  and  controls  designed  to  prevent  us  from  having  unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or enEEes.  As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their l oca l  s a ncEons  obliga Eons  a nd U.S. a nd EU s a ncEons  progra ms.  In the U.S., these obligaEons include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against  OFAC sancEons lists (including the  SDN  List). Iran and  Syria have been idenEfied by the  U.S.  State  Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated enEEes located in these countries and do not license enEEes domiciled there.

AddiEonally, regulaEons such as the EU's Payment Services DirecEve in the EEA require financial insEtuEons to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transacEons away from Mastercard products and provide payment iniEaEon and account informaEon services directly to consumers who use our products.  AuthoriEes in the EU are also revising standards relaEng to the authenEcaEon of transacEons, which may increase the number of transacEons that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\n\nRegulaHon of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories.

Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.  For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respecEvely s ubject to, a mong other laws and regulaEons, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency informaEon safeguarding requirements under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a wriNen, comprehensive informaEon security program and, increasingly, a number of  s ta te   da ta   a nd  pri va cy  l a ws .

In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

      "question": "What was the strategic significance of the reduction in Class B shares from 7,168,369 in 2023 to just 7 in 2024, and how did this affect the voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B stockholders at MA?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MA disclosed that there were 7,168,369 Class B shares outstanding, each carrying 15 votes, giving Class B stockholders significant non-dilutable voting power. By 2024, the number of Class B shares had been drastically reduced to just 7, effectively diminishing the concentrated voting control previously held by the Class B shareholder. This shift indicates a strategic move to realign ownership control, likely reducing the influence of the single Class B holder while increasing the relative voting power of Class A shareholders. The relationship between Class A and Class B shares, where Class A shares collectively hold 66 2/3% of the voting power and Class B holds the remaining 33 1/3%, now reflects a much weaker Class B position due to the extreme reduction in the number of shares, fundamentally altering the equity control structure.",

        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 MA(2024): MA's 2024 filing shows only 7 Class B shares remain, drastically reducing the total voting power concentrated in Class B and shifting control dynamics toward Class A shareholders."

      "question": "How did JPM's compliance with MREL requirements through its UK subsidiary J.P. Morgan Securities plc evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in relation to the Tier 1 leverage ratio and regulatory capital planning?",
      "answer": "In 2023, J.P. Morgan Securities plc was compliant with its MREL requirements and was subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3.25% established by the PRA, effective January 1, 2023. This reflects a structured capital planning approach to meet both U.K. and Basel III regulatory expectations. In 2024, while no new compliance metrics were disclosed, the inclusion of MREL in the glossary of the 10-K filing indicates continued emphasis on the concept within JPM\u2019s regulatory capital framework, suggesting that MREL remains a focal point in the firm\u2019s capital planning and risk management disclosures. This implies a continuity in JPM's approach to meeting U.K. regulatory capital obligations through its subsidiary, despite the absence of updated quantitative compliance data in the 2024 report.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JPM(2023) \u2192 J.P. Morgan Securities plc: JPM has a stake in J.P. Morgan Securities plc, which is subject to U.K. regulatory capital requirements including MREL and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3.25%.",
        "Hop 2: J.P. Morgan Securities plc \u2192 MREL Requirements: J.P. Morgan Securities plc is required to maintain MREL as mandated by the Bank of England and was compliant as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 3: MREL Requirements \u2190 JPM(2024): In the 2024 filing, MREL is formally defined in the glossary, indicating ongoing relevance in JPM\u2019s capital planning and regulatory disclosures, though no new compliance figures are provided."

      "question": "How did the change in Class B to Class A common stock conversion rate from 2022 to 2024 affect V's voting power structure, and what does this imply about the concentration of control following the reduction in Class B shares outstanding from 245 million to 125 million?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Class B to Class A common stock conversion rate was 1.6059, with 245 million Class B shares translating into 394 million as-converted Class A shares, representing a significant portion of voting power. By 2024, the number of Class B shares outstanding dropped to 125 million, while Class A shares increased to 1,733 million. Although the conversion rate slightly increased to an implied value above 1.6228, the halving of Class B shares significantly reduced their as-converted voting influence. Given that Class B shares historically held 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, this reduction likely reshaped the balance of control, potentially increasing the influence of Class A shareholders. This shift suggests a move toward broader shareholder governance, though Class B still retains disproportionate voting rights per share.",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, MS was subject to the Stress Capital Buffer as part of its regulatory capital framework, which required maintaining additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to avoid restrictions on capital distributions. This buffer was composed of the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB), G-SIB surcharge, and CCyB. By 2024, MS remained subject to the Capital Conservation Buffer, which functioned similarly and was calculated as 2.5% of total RWA under the Standardized Approach and included the G-SIB surcharge. With RWA increasing in 2024\u2014driven by growth in Corporate lending and Securities financing transactions under both approaches\u2014MS had to maintain higher CET1 capital levels to satisfy both the ongoing Capital Conservation Buffer and its G-SIB surcharge, directly linking the 2023 regulatory framework to the 2024 capital requirements.",

        "Hop 2: [Stress Capital Buffer] \u2192 [Capital Conservation Buffer]: The Stress Capital Buffer in 2023 consisted of the SCB, G-SIB surcharge, and CCyB, forming the foundation for the Capital Conservation Buffer in 2024, which also required CET1 capital to meet buffer thresholds.",
        "Hop 3: [Capital Conservation Buffer] \u2190 [MS](2024): In 2024, MS remained subject to the Capital Conservation Buffer, with CET1 capital required to meet the 2.5% threshold under the Standardized Approach, now combined with an increased RWA due to growth in corporate lending and securitization activities."

Under the Standardized Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher Securities financing transactions, growth in Corporate lending, as well as an increase in Other credit risk driven by securitizations. These increases  were  partially  offset  by  decreased  ex posure  in  derivatives. Under the Advanced Approach, the increase was primarily due to growth in Corporate lending, increase in Derivatives driven by counterparty credit risk, and higher  Securities  financing  transactions.  These  increases  were  partially offset by decreased exposure in investment securities.\n\nMarket  risk  RWA  increased  in  2024  under  both  the  Standardized  and Advanced Approaches, primarily  driven  by  higher  charges  on  Specific  risk and Incremental risk due to increased exposures.\n\nThe increase in Operational risk RWA in 2024 is related to legal expenses and execution losses.\n\n## G-SIB Capital Surcharge\n\nWe  and  other  U.S.  G -SIBs  are  subject  to  an  additional  risk-based  capital surcharge, the G -SIB capital surcharge, which must be satisfied using CET1 capital and which functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The surcharge is calculated based on the  G -SIB's size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, and complex ity and\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nsubstitutability ('Method 1') or use of short-term wholesale funding ('Method 2'), whichever is higher.\n\n## Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements\n\nThe Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt ('L TD') and  clean  holding  company  requirements  for  top-tier  BHCs  of  U.S.  G -SIBs ('covered  BHCs'),  including  the  Parent  Company.  These  requirements  are designed  to  ensure  that  covered  BHCs  will  have  enough  loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible  L TD  to  equity  or  otherwise  by  imposing  losses  on  eligible  L TD  or other  forms  of  TLAC  where  an  SPOE  resolution  strategy  is  used  (see 'Business-Supervision and Regulation-Financial  Holding  CompanyResolution  and  Recovery  Planning'  and  'Risk  Factors-Legal,  Regulatory and Compliance Risk').\n\nThese TLAC and eligible L TD requirements include various restrictions, such as requiring eligible  L TD to: be issued by the covered BHC; be unsecured; have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance; and not contain certain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption amount subject to reduction based on the performance of an asset, entity or index, or a similar feature.  In  addition,  the  requirements  provide  permanent  grandfathering  for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible L TD but  for  having  impermissible  acceleration  clauses  or  being  governed  by foreign law.\n\nA covered BHC is also required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA or (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the  denominator  of  its  SLR).  Covered  BHCs  must  also  meet  a  minimum external L TD requirement equal to the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.\n\nTLAC buffer  requirements  are  imposed  on  top  of  both  the  risk-based  and leverage  exposure-based  external  TLAC  minimum  requirements.  The  riskbased TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposurebased TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of our total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG included extended warranty as part of its personal lines offerings under U.S. Personal Insurance, which also included automobile and homeowners' insurance, and consumer specialty products. The segment noted that personal lines were generally short-tail in nature with significant salvage and subrogation recoveries. By 2023, AIG continued to list extended warranty as a component of personal lines, now specifically within UK/Europe and Japan Personal Insurance, again alongside automobile and homeowners' insurance and consumer specialty products, and again described personal lines as generally short-tail. The continued inclusion of extended warranty in personal lines across both years suggests a strategic consistency in AIG\u2019s short-tail risk portfolio composition, maintaining exposure to products with faster claim emergence and recoveries.",

Accident and health products include voluntary and sponsor-paid personal accident and supplemental health products for individuals, employees, associations and other organizations as well as a broad range of travel insurance products and services for leisure and business travelers. Personal lines include automobile and homeowners' insurance, extended warranty, and consumer specialty products, such as identity theft and credit card protection. Personal lines also provides insurance for high net worth individuals offered through AIG Private Client Group, including auto, homeowners, umbrella, yacht, fine art and collections insurance. Personal lines are generally short-tail in nature and can reflect significant salvage and subrogation recoveries.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by line of business and may separately review various sub-segments, such as specific accident and health products and property damage versus liability for personal lines products.\n\nFrequency/severity methods, loss development methods, and IBNR factor methods are used alone or in combination to set reserves for short-tail product lines such as personal property.\n\nFrequency/severity and loss development methods are utilized for domestic personal auto product lines.\n\nFor these classes of business, reliance is placed on frequency/severity methods as claim counts emerge quickly for personal auto. Frequency/severity methods allow for more immediate analysis of resulting loss trends and comparisons to industry and other diagnostic metrics. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques.\n\n## UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $210 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by recognition of large loss activity in Financial PI in the UK and Commercial D&amp;O in Europe.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $258 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by Financial Lines in the UK and Europe and Excess Casualty in Europe as we continue to see increased severity of large losses in these classes.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $161 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by increased large loss activity in recent accident years, particularly related to UK directors and officers class action suits against insureds with global exposure, and increased frequency and severity in European casualty for auto liability and employers liability. This was slightly offset by a benefit from an increase in the Ogden rates in the UK used to value long duration claims.\n\n274 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock at MA change from 2022 to 2024, and what implications did this have for shareholder influence and corporate governance?",
      "answer": "In 2022, holders of Class A common stock held approximately 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock, which had 15 votes per share, represented 33 1/3% of the voting power. By 2024, the structure remained consistent in terms of voting rights, but the actual number of shares outstanding changed: Class A shares outstanding decreased from 927 million in 2023 to 907 million in 2024, while Class B shares remained stable at 7 million. This reduction in Class A shares increased the relative influence of Class B shares, which are held entirely by Mr. Brian L. Roberts, thereby concentrating corporate governance power further in the hands of the controlling shareholder.",

        "Hop 1: [MA](2022) \u2192 [Class B Common Stock]: MA disclosed the structure of its Class A and Class B shares, noting that Class B shares had 15 votes per share and represented 33 1/3% of the combined voting power.",
        "Hop 2: [Class B Common Stock] \u2192 [Class A Common Stock]: The voting rights of Class A and Class B shares were interdependent, with Class A holding 66 2/3% and Class B holding 33 1/3% of the voting power, and both classes typically voting together as one class.",
        "Hop 3: [Class A Common Stock] \u2190 [MA](2024): In 2024, MA disclosed that Class A shares outstanding had decreased to 907 million from 927 million in 2023, while Class B shares remained unchanged at 7 million, maintaining the same voting structure but increasing the relative influence of Class B shares."

      "answer": "In 2023, SCHW (through its subsidiaries CSC and CSB) was subject to a stress capital buffer of 2.5% for CSC and required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for CSB, while the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) remained at zero for both. The capital buffer requirement was calculated as the sum of the SCB, G-SIB surcharge, and CCyB under the Standardized Approach, and as the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB surcharge, and CCyB under the Advanced Approach. By 2024, SCHW maintained the same structure: a 2.5% stress capital buffer for CSC and a 2.5% capital conservation buffer for CSB, with the CCyB still at zero. This indicates that the regulatory framework and SCHW\u2019s compliance approach remained stable year-over-year, with no changes in buffer percentages or calculation methodologies.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AXP relied heavily on unsecured debt as part of its diversified funding strategy, which included deposits, unsecured debt, and asset securitizations. According to GS_10k_2024.pdf, eligible long-term debt is defined as unsecured debt with a remaining maturity of at least one year and additional regulatory qualifications. In 2024, AXP faced new capital rules that required the company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of this specific type of debt. AXP's prior reliance on unsecured debt could support compliance, but the added maturity and structural requirements for eligible long-term debt under the 2024 rules meant that not all of AXP\u2019s existing unsecured debt from 2023 would qualify. This necessitated strategic adjustments to align its debt portfolio with the new standards, especially as failure to meet these requirements could restrict AXP\u2019s ability to pay dividends or expand its business.",

Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. G eneral economic factors, such as recession, unemployment, inflation and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. A customer's ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social conditions but also by a customer's other payment obligations, and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their obligations to us.\n\nWe rely principally on the customer's creditworthiness for repayment of loans or receivables and therefore often have no other recourse for collection. Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired as a result of changes in our underwriting practices or if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. This may be exacerbated to the extent information we have historically relied upon to make credit decisions does not accurately portray a customer's creditworthiness, including as a result of the current interest rate and economic conditions. Further, our pricing strategies, particularly for new lending features and non-card lending products, may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nRising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for credit losses. Higher writeoff rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for credit losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds.\n\nAlthough we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk or collect amounts owed to us may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance) or changes in customer behavior (such as the increased use of debt settlement companies). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States, as U.S. Card Members were responsible for approximately 88 percent of our total Card Member loans outstanding as of December 31, 2024), increases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings.\n\nWe had net interest income of approximately $15.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change as benchmark interest rates change. For example, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have raised interest rates in response to heightened inflationary pressures. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see 'Risk Management - Market Risk Management Process' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## We are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, or the OCC with respect to AENB, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business, expand our business or engage in acquisitions. Some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions. For ex ample, in 2023 the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies proposed capital rules that would result in significantly higher regulatory capital requirements for us and rules that would require us and AENB to issue and/or maintain minimum amounts of eligible long-term debt with specific terms. In addition, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital because of an increase in the SCB requirement based on results from a supervisory stress test.\n\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules or supervisory expectations regarding capital and liquidity risk management capabilities and practices may also negatively impact the assessment of us and AENB by federal banking regulators. Additionally, we are subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements as a result of becoming a Category III firm, which may further increase if we grow to become a Category II firm.\n\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see 'Supervision and Regulation - Capital and Liquidity Regulation' under 'Business.'",

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab's financials reflected significant expenses from TD Ameritrade, including $3.1 billion in total expenses from TDA in 2021, which included compensation, professional services, and occupancy costs tied to its clearing operations. The 2022 10-K described how TD Ameritrade provided clearing services to retail investors and RIAs, generating revenue through commissions, interest from margin lending, and asset management fees. By 2024, Schwab had evolved its secured financing structure, evidenced by $16.7 billion in FHLB-secured credit facilities and $5.499 billion in repurchase agreements, both of which were used to manage liquidity and support its expanded operations post-integration. This shift indicates a strategic move toward institutional financing mechanisms, likely to support the integrated clearing infrastructure and manage interest-bearing liabilities more efficiently.",

The 2021 increase reflected TDA's full-year contribution of $1.2 billion of compensation and benefits expense compared with $453 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was also due to additional headcount to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, a higher bonus accrual, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. Total compensation and benefits expense increased from 2020 to 2019, primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount related to our acquisitions of TDA and USAA-IMCO. The increase in 2020 from 2019 also reflected the Company's payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compensation and benefits included acquisition and integration-related costs of $283 million and $235 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nProfessional services expense increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's results of operations and overall growth in the business.

In the Advisor Services arena, we compete with institutional custodians, traditional and discount brokers, banks, and trust companies.\n\nAcross both segments, our key competitive advantages are:\n\n- Scale and Size of the Business - As one of the largest investment services firms in the U.S., we are able to spread operating costs and amortize new investments over a large base of clients, and harness the resources to evolve capabilities to meet client needs.\n- Operating Efficiency - Coupled with scale, our operating efficiency and sharing of infrastructure across different businesses creates a cost advantage that enables us to competitively price products and services while profitably serving clients of various sizes across multiple channels.\n- Operating Structure - Providing bank and asset management services to broker-dealer clients helps serve a wider array of needs, thereby deepening relationships, enhancing the stability of client assets, and enabling diversified revenue streams.\n- Brand and Corporate Reputation - In an industry dependent on trust, Schwab's reputation and brand across multiple constituents enable us to attract clients and employees while credibly introducing new products to the market.\n- Service Culture - Delivering a great client experience earns the trust and loyalty of clients and increases the likelihood that those clients will refer others.\n- Willingness to Disrupt - Management's willingness to challenge the status quo, including our own business practices, to benefit clients fosters innovation and continuous improvement, which helps to attract more clients and assets.\n\n## Business and Asset Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of TD Ameritrade\n\nEffective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (TDA Holding) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'TD Ameritrade' or 'TDA'). TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its futures commission merchant (FCM) and forex dealer member (FDM) subsidiary.\n\nTDA provides services to individual retail investors and to RIAs predominantly through the Internet, a national branch network, and relationships with RIAs. TD Ameritrade's sources of net revenues primarily consist of trading revenue, bank deposit account fees, net interest revenue, and asset management and administration fees.\n\n- TDA's trading revenue includes commissions earned on trades of certain securities and derivatives, as well as order flow revenue.\n- Bank deposit account fees are earned through an insured deposit account agreement with TD Bank USA, National Association and TD Bank, National Association (together, the TD Depository Institutions), as well as bank deposit account sweep agreements with other third-party depository institutions, whereby uninvested cash held within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept into deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions.\n- TDA's net interest revenue is generated primarily through margin lending, securities lending activity, as well as segregated and operating cash and investments. Interest-bearing liabilities primarily consist of interest-bearing payables to brokerage clients and long-term debt.\n- TDA's asset management and administration fee revenue includes revenues earned on client assets invested in money market funds, other mutual funds, and certain investment programs. TDA's asset management and administration fees also include referral and asset-based program fees on its client assets managed by independent RIAs utilizing TDA's trading and investing platforms.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MA disclosed the structure and activity of its Class A and Class B common stock, which is essential for understanding the baseline voting power distribution. According to the evidence, Class B shares are entitled to 15 votes per share, while the voting power of Class A shares depends on the total outstanding shares of both classes. Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares on a one-to-one basis, subject to certain restrictions. By 2024, MA\u2019s disclosures showed that there were 1,404 million Class A shares issued and 907 million shares outstanding, while Class B shares remained limited at 7 million issued and outstanding. Despite the convertibility feature, the minimal number of Class B shares in 2024 suggests no significant conversion activity occurred between 2022 and 2024, preserving the existing voting power dynamics.

      "answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon restructured its business by disaggregating the Investment Services segment into two new segments: Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services. This reorganization emphasized a sharper focus on core competencies, particularly in asset servicing and global custody. By 2023, BNY Mellon SA/NV, the company's main European banking subsidiary headquartered in Brussels with a branch in Amsterdam, had aligned its operations with these strategic priorities. The Amsterdam branch played a key role in supporting SA/NV\u2019s activities in Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services, particularly in global custody and asset servicing across continental Europe. This indicates that the 2022 restructuring directly shaped the operational focus and regional importance of BNY Mellon SA/NV in 2023, especially in markets served through its Amsterdam branch.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## Description of Business\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with $46.7 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration and $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2021. With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.\n\nWe previously divided our businesses into two business segments, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth Management. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we disaggregated our Investment Services business segment into two new business segments, Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services. Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment was not impacted by this resegmentation. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments and certain business exits.\n\nFor a further discussion of BNY Mellon's lines of business, products and services, see the 'Overview,' 'Summary of financial highlights,' 'Fee and other revenue,' 'Review of business segments' and 'International operations' sections in the MD&amp;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See the 'Available Information' section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon.\n\nOur two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:\n\n- The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury\n- Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bank-advised business of Investment Management; and\n- BNY Mellon, National Association ('BNY Mellon, N.A.'), a national bank, which houses our Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses.\n\nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY Mellon's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve').  The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV ('BNY Mellon SA/NV') is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe. It is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Belgium under the Single Supervisory Mechanism and is also supervised by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority for conduct of business rules. BNY Mellon SA/NV has its principal office in Brussels and branches in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Copenhagen, Denmark; Dublin, Ireland; Frankfurt, Germany; the City of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France.  BNY Mellon SA/NV's activities are in the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments of BNY Mellon with a focus on global custody, asset servicing and collateral management.

      "answer": "In 2022, AXP held variable interests of $15.0 billion in the Lending Trust, which issued $8,199 million in Fixed Rate Senior Notes with a year-end interest rate of 2.01%. By 2023, AXP's stake in the Lending Trust increased, and the Trust significantly raised its issuance of Fixed Rate Senior Notes to $13,449 million, with the interest rate rising to 3.36%. This indicates that AXP's increased involvement in the Trust coincided with a strategic shift toward issuing more fixed-rate debt at higher interest rates, potentially reflecting market conditions or refinancing strategies.",

The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors.\n\nThe Trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. Refer to Note 1 for further details on the principles of consolidation. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts' economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our ownership of variable interests was $15.0 billion and $13.4 billion, respectively, for the Lending Trust and $3.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, for the Charge Trust. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts.\n\nThe debt securities issued by the Trusts are non-recourse to us. The securitized Card Member loans and receivables held by the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust, respectively, are available only for payment of the debt securities or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions (refer to Note 2). The long-term debt of each Trust is payable only out of collections on their respective underlying securitized assets (refer to Note 8).\n\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Lending Trust and Charge Trust was $42 million and $1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $47 million and nil, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities.\n\nUnder the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no such triggering events occurred.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG's CMBS holdings had a total fair value of $13.348 billion with $1.420 billion in gross unrealized losses. By 2023, the CMBS exposure decreased to $11.056 billion in fair value, with $1.246 billion in gross unrealized losses. This reflects a reduction in CMBS holdings and a slight improvement in unrealized losses, suggesting a potential de-risking or rebalancing of AIG's structured securities portfolio. Structured securities, including CMBS, are a key component of AIG\u2019s investment strategy, and the shift may indicate a response to market conditions or internal risk management adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG(2022) \u2192 Structured Securities: AIG's 2022 portfolio heavily relied on structured securities, including CMBS, to support insurance liabilities and generate investment income.",
        "Hop 2: Structured Securities \u2192 CMBS: CMBS is a subset of structured securities, indicating that changes in CMBS exposure reflect broader trends in structured securities.",
        "Hop 3: CMBS \u2190 AIG(2023): In 2023, AIG's CMBS holdings showed a decline in both fair value and unrealized losses compared to 2022."

          "chunk_text": "ITEM 1 |\n\nBusiness\n\n## Investment Activities of Our Insurance Operations\n\nOur insurance companies generally receive premiums and deposits well in advance of paying covered claims or benefits. In the intervening periods, we invest these premiums and deposits to generate net investment income that, along with the invested funds, is available to pay claims or benefits. As a result, we generate significant revenues from insurance investment activities.\n\nThe practice for managing the investments of the insurance companies places primary emphasis on meeting the specific needs of each business unit. The investment objectives are the generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies, as well as structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans.\n\nFor additional information on investment strategies see Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A - Investments.\n\n## Loss Reserve Development Process\n\nThe liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (loss reserves) represents the accumulation of estimates for unpaid claims, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) for our General Insurance companies and the related expenses of settling those losses.\n\nThe process of establishing loss reserves is complex and inherently imprecise because it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events. As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process. Because reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in prior year estimates are unavoidable in the insurance industry. These changes are sometimes referred to as 'prior year loss development', 'reserve development' or variations thereof.\n\nFor additional information on loss reserves and prior year loss development see Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves, Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A - Insurance Reserves - Loss Reserves, and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 7",

      "answer": "In 2022, MET was subject to regulatory constraints that limited its ability to differentiate products through branding and communication, as seen in the PM filing which noted that such regulation could 'materially adversely impact' differentiation efforts and pricing power, especially during economic uncertainty when consumers tend to down-trade to lower-priced options. By 2024, MET's filing shows a strategic pivot toward 'product development focused on differentiation' as a response to these pressures, despite continued 'intense competition with respect to product features and services.' MET emphasized investments in 'brand equity, product development, technology optimization, and innovation' as fundamentals for growth, even as they faced ongoing regulatory scrutiny. This represents a clear evolution from being passively impacted by regulation in 2022 to proactively shaping their competitive strategy around differentiation in 2024.",

Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. We review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term care claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, set the discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate environment.\n\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees.  Most of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression.\n\nBased on our investment portfolios and cash flow estimates, approximately 6% of our invested assets each year are subject to reinvestment risk through 2027.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario. Higher reinvestment rates on cash flows, over time, more than offset the negative impacts of (i) higher interest crediting rates, and (ii) lower income from derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment.\n\n## Corporate &amp; Other\n\nCorporate &amp; Other contains the surplus investment portfolios used to fund capital and liquidity needs, certain reinsurance agreements, collateral financing arrangements,  and  our  outstanding  debt  and  preferred  securities.

The negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets, over time, more than offsets the positive impact of lower interest expense on debt, preferred stock dividends and lower pension expense. Although low interest rates result in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increasing, the impact is more than offset by the corresponding returns on fixed income investments and results in lower expenses.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario . The positive impact of reinvesting in higher yielding assets, over time, more than offsets the negative impact of higher interest expense on debt, preferred stock dividends and higher pension expense. Although higher interest rates result in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities decreasing, the impact is more than offset by the corresponding returns on fixed income investments and results in higher expenses.\n\n## Competitive Pressures\n\nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See 'Business - Competition.' Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Certain of the industry's products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability  to  invest  in  brand  equity,  product  development,  technology  optimization,  risk  management,  and  innovation,  which  are  among  the  fundamentals  for  sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the ability to leverage the capabilities of new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third-party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. Rising demands from stakeholders to address ESG  issues have resulted in insurers expanding their sustainability efforts. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See 'Business - Regulation.' In addition to financial strength, technological efficiency and organizational agility, we believe that the ability to adapt  to  changes  in  the  competitive  environment  as  a  result  of  global  market  volatility,  changing  interest  rates  and  uncertain  economic  conditions  is  a  significant differentiator to success in the life insurance industry and the broader financial services industry, and we are well positioned to compete in this environment.",

      "question": "How did the shift in Morgan Stanley's (2023) credit protection strategies involving CDS and portfolio tranches influence their disclosed involvement with CDOs in (2024), particularly in terms of risk exposure and structured transaction design?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Morgan Stanley actively used credit protection mechanisms like single-name and tranched CDS to manage credit risk, including selling protection and structuring risk mitigation strategies across various debt instruments. This approach extended to their involvement with structured products such as CDOs, where the firm sold credit protection embedded in hybrid instruments like CLNs and CDOs. By 2024, Morgan Stanley disclosed deeper involvement in Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), particularly CDOs, where their role as servicer or collateral manager determined consolidation. The firm's earlier use of tranched CDS and structured credit risk transfer in 2023 aligns with their 2024 disclosures showing increased participation in CDOs as part of broader securitization activities, indicating a strategic evolution from risk transfer to active structuring and risk retention in these vehicles.",

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe  Firm's  variable  interests  in  V IEs  include  debt  and  equity  interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. The Firm's involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n\n- Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its  Investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.\n- Guarantees  issued  and  residual  interests  retained  in  connection  with municipal bond securitizations.\n- Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.\n- Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n- Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n- Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial  involvement  with  the  V IE  and  reassesses  whether  it  is  the  primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the  VIE,  including  the  V IE's  structure  and  activities,  the  power  to  make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.\n\nThe  power  to  make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  may  take  a number  of  different  forms  in  different  types  of  V IEs.  The  Firm  considers servicing  or  collateral  management  decisions  as  representing  the  power  to make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  in  transactions  such  as securitizations or CDOs.  As  a result, the Firm does not consolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager  or  to  require  the  liquidation  of  the  entity.  If  the  Firm  serves  as servicer  or  collateral  manager,  or  has  certain  other  rights  described  in  the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates  only  those  VIEs  for  which  it  holds  a  potentially  significant interest in the V IE.\n\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were  issued  in  a  transaction  sponsored  by  the  Firm  and  the  ex tent  of  the information  available  to  the  Firm  and  to  investors,  the  number,  nature  and involvement  of  investors,  other  rights  held  by  the  Firm  and  investors,  the standardization  of  the  legal  documentation  and  the  level  of  continuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\n\n## Consolidated VIE  Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n\n",

By 2024, AIG no longer consolidated Corebridge and instead reported its investment under the equity method, recognizing income based on dividends received and changes in stock price since June 9, 2024.

Segment Information (All Registrants)\n\nOperating  segments  for  each  of  the  Registrants  are  determined  based  on  information  used  by  the  CODM  in  deciding  how  to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.\n\nExelon  has  eleven  reportable  segments,  which  includes  five  reportable  segments  for  Generation  consisting  of  the  Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and all other power regions referred to     collectively as 'Other Power Regions' and ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI's three reportable segments consisting of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each represent a single reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE's CODMs evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE based on net income.\n\nThe  basis  for  the  reportable  segments  of  Generation  is  the  integrated  management  of  Generation's  electricity  business  that  is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple  supply  sources  to  provide  electricity  through  various  distribution  channels  (wholesale  and  retail).  Generation's  hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of the five reportable segments of Generation are as follows:\n\n- Mid-Atlantic represents  operations  in  the  eastern  half  of  PJM,  which  includes  New  Jersey,  Maryland,  Virginia,  West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\n- Midwest represents operations in the western half of PJM and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding MISO's Southern Region.\n- New York represents operations within NYISO.\n- ERCOT represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas that covers a majority of the state of Texas.\n- Other Power Regions:\n- New England represents operations within ISO-NE.\n- South represents  operations  in  the  FRCC,  MISO's  Southern  Region,  and  the  remaining  portions  of  the  SERC  not included within MISO or PJM.\n- West represents operations in the WECC, which includes CAISO.\n- Canada represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO, and the Canadian portion of MISO.\n\nThe CODM evaluates the performance of Generation's electric business activities and allocates resources based on Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense (RNF).

This non-dilutable voting arrangement, where each Class B share carries 15 votes, continues to concentrate significant governance control with the Class B shareholder despite the broader ownership base of Class A shares. The structure ensures that while most matters are voted on as a single class, the Class B holder maintains outsized influence over critical decisions such as director elections.",

Approval required an affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each series, with each series voting as a single class. By 2023, the framework remained substantively unchanged in terms of the core voting conditions for Series B Preferred Stock. However, there was a notable expansion in the scope of defined matters for common stockholders, including Class B and C common stockholders, who gained additional voting rights for certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation. This suggests a strategic emphasis on broader shareholder engagement while maintaining consistent voting constraints on preferred stockholders.",

The shares of series B and C preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of series B and C preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the series B and C preferred stock  (whether  by  such  12th  anniversary,  or  thereafter  with  respect  to  claims  pending  on  such  anniversary),  the conversion rate would be adjusted downward and the holder would receive either class A common stock or series A preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company's charter). The conversion rates may also be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities.\n\nThe series A preferred stock, generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company's class A common stock, is freely transferable and each share of series A preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.\n\nVoting rights. The holders of the series B and C preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain  defined  matters,  including,  in  specified  circumstances,  any  consolidation,  merger,  combination  or  similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences,  rights  and  privileges  of  the  applicable  series  of  preferred  stock  or  (ii)  receive  securities,  cash  or  other property that is different from what the Company's class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the series B and C preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the series A preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the series B and C preferred stock.\n\nClass A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will  vote  together  with  the  class A  common  stockholders  in  a  single  class,  and  (ii)  in  specified  circumstances,  any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class. In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Holders of the Company's common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certificate of incorporation that relates solely to any series of preferred stock.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory pressure on interchange fees in 2022 influence Visa's competitive dynamics with Mastercard in 2023, particularly in light of Mastercard's own regulatory challenges and Visa's litigation liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Visa faced significant regulatory pressure globally, including caps on interchange fees in the EU (30 basis points for credit and 20 for debit), potential expansion of regulation in Australia and New Zealand, and cross-border interchange scrutiny, particularly following the EU settlement. This regulatory environment constrained Visa's ability to set optimal interchange rates, potentially reducing issuer and acquirer incentives to use its network. In 2023, Mastercard faced similar regulatory pressures, including a U.S. Federal Reserve proposal to lower interchange caps by ~28%-30% and renewed U.S. Senate legislation to extend routing mandates to credit cards, which could have diluted its network control. Simultaneously, Visa faced ongoing litigation risk from the 2005 interchange multidistrict litigation, including a $600 million payment under the 2018 Amended Settlement Agreement. These factors together created a more constrained and litigious environment for both Visa and Mastercard, likely intensifying competition as both sought to retain issuer and acquirer partnerships under tighter regulatory and financial constraints.",

        "Hop 3: Mastercard \u2190 V(2023): Visa faced litigation liabilities from interchange-related class actions, including a $600 million settlement payment in 2023, intensifying its financial exposure compared to Mastercard."

In Europe, the EU's IFR places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross-border transactions within the EEA (30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively). EU member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories. The European Commission recently announced its intention to conduct another impact assessment of the IFR, which could result in even lower caps on interchange rates and the expansion of regulation to other types  of  products,  services  and  fees.  Several  countries  in  Latin America  are  exploring  regulatory  measures against payments networks and have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Costa Rica. In Asia Pacific, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) completed its review of the country's  payment  system  regulations  and  adopted  a  series  of  measures,  which  include  lower  interchange rates for debit transactions. The RBA also continues to assess the potential merits of mandating co-badging and  routing  requirements  on  dual  network  debit  cards.  In  addition,  the  New  Zealand  Parliament  passed legislation capping domestic interchange rates for debit and credit products.\n\n- While the focus of interchange regulation has primarily been on domestic rates historically, there is increasing focus on cross-border rates in recent years. For example, in 2019, we settled certain cross-border interchange rates with the European Commission. The UK's PSR recently initiated two market reviews: one focusing on post-Brexit increases in interchange rates for transactions between the UK and Europe, and the other focusing on increases in scheme and processing fees in the UK. Meanwhile, Costa Rica became the first country to formally regulate cross-border interchange rates by direct regulation. Cross-border MDR is also regulated in Costa Rica and Turkey.\n- Many  governments  including,  but  not  limited  to  governments  in  India,  Costa  Rica  and  Turkey  are  using regulation to further drive down MDR, which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions. With increased  lobbying  by  merchants  and  other  industry  participants,  we  are  also  beginning  to  see  regulatory interest  in  network  fees  in  the  UK,  Europe  and  Chile.  Also,  some  countries  in  Latin  America,  like  Peru, Argentina and Chile, are also relying on antitrust-driven regulatory actions that can have implications for how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate, including the enforceability of important network rules relating  to  honor  all  cards  or  products  and  cross-border  acquiring.  Other  countries,  like  New  Zealand,  are adopting regulations that require us to seek government pre-approval of our network rules, which could also impact the way we operate in certain markets.\n- Government regulations or pressure may also impact our rules and practices and require us to allow other payments networks to support Visa products or services,  to  have  the  other  network's  functionality  or  brand marks on our products, or to share our intellectual property with other networks. As innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, they have also expanded the potential scope  of  regulatory  influence.  For  instance,  new  products  and  capabilities,  including  tokenization,  push payments,  and  new  flows  (e.g.,  Visa  B2B  Connect)  could  bring  increased  licensing  or  authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered. Furthermore, certain of our businesses are regulated as payment institutions or as money transmitters, subjecting us to various licensing, supervisory, and other requirements. In addition, the EU's requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies.\n\nRegulators  around  the  world  increasingly  take  note  of  each  other's  approaches  to  regulating  the  payments industry. Consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another. The risks created by a new law, regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. For example, our settlement with the European  Commission  on  cross-border  interchange  rates  has  drawn  preliminary  attention  from  some  regulators  in other parts of the world. Similarly, new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments (or vice versa). The Reserve Bank of Australia initially capped credit interchange, but subsequently capped debit interchange as well.\n\nWhen we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors'  closed-loop  payments  systems  with  direct  connections  to  both  merchants  and  consumers.  We  believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to",

      "question": "How did the shift in CSC's reliance on uncommitted lines of credit with external banks between 2022 and 2023 reflect changes in Schwab's broader short-term liquidity strategy, particularly in light of the increase in repurchase agreements and secured borrowing activity?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CSC had access to $1.5 billion in uncommitted lines of credit with external banks, with no amounts outstanding, indicating a conservative approach to short-term borrowing. In 2023, this facility remained available at $1.767 billion, but CSC and CS&Co began utilizing secured borrowing channels more actively\u2014CSC had $4.903 billion in repurchase agreements and CS&Co had $950 million in secured uncommitted line borrowings. This reflects a shift toward leveraging collateralized financing options, likely to optimize liquidity at lower risk-adjusted costs, while maintaining access to unsecured credit as a backup. The weighted-average interest rate on these secured borrowings (5.53% for repurchase agreements and 5.70% for secured lines) also suggests a strategic trade-off between cost and availability in a rising rate environment.",

This segment was linked to favorable mortality trends, particularly in the pension risk transfer portion of the business, which positively impacted adjusted earnings by $81 million in 2022. By 2023, favorable mortality continued to play a key role in financial performance, contributing $232 million to adjusted pre-tax income.

The impact of positive flows from pension risk transfer transactions and funding agreement issuances resulted in higher average invested assets, improving net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested  assets,  interest  credited  expenses  on  long-duration  and  deposit-type  liabilities  increased.  Higher  volume-related, premium tax and direct expenses, driven by business growth, were partially offset by the 2021 abatement of the annual health insurer  fee  under  the  PPACA.  The  net  increase  in  expenses  was  more  than  offset  by  a  corresponding  increase  in  adjusted premiums,  fees  and  other  revenues.  The  combined  impact  of  the  items  affecting  our  business  growth  increased  adjusted earnings by $130 million.\n\nMarket Factors. Market  factors,  including  interest  rate  levels,  variability  in  equity  market  returns  and  foreign  currency fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased primarily driven by the favorable impact of equity market returns on our private equity funds and the favorable impact of real estate market returns on our real estate investments, primarily real estate funds, partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans. The impact of interest rate fluctuations resulted in a decline in our average  interest  credited  rates  on  deposit-type  and  long-duration  liabilities,  which  drove  a  decrease  in  interest  credited expenses. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $1.1 billion increase in adjusted earnings.\n\nUnderwriting. Unfavorable mortality in our Group Benefits business resulted in a decrease in adjusted earnings of $767 million. This was primarily driven by: (i) increases in both incidence and severity in both COVID-19 and core claims across our life businesses; and (ii) unfavorable results in our accidental death &amp; dismemberment business due to lower incidence in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Favorable mortality in our RIS business, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an increase in adjusted earnings of $81 million, driven by our pension risk transfer, structured settlement, specialized benefit resource and post-retirement benefit businesses, partially offset by unfavorable results in our institutional income  annuity  business.  Unfavorable  claims  experience,  partially  offset  by  the  impact  of  growth  in  our  Group  Benefits business, resulted in a $248 million decrease in adjusted earnings, primarily due to: (i) unfavorable dental results, primarily the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which limited availability of services and reduced utilization in 2020; and (ii) unfavorable claims experience in our group disability business, partially offset by: (i) the impact of the acquisition of Versant Health on our vision business; (ii) favorable claims experience in the individual disability business; and (iii) the impact of business growth in our accident &amp; health business.",

This represents a decrease of 39,428,502 shares, indicating that a significant portion of previously available shares under the 2022 LTIP were allocated to RSRs over the year.

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife actively hedged reinvestment risk using long-duration receive-fixed U.S. interest rate swaps, particularly sensitive to 10-year and 30-year swap rates, to offset the negative impact of reinvesting cash flows in lower-yielding assets under a declining interest rate scenario. By 2024, the company was still facing the challenge of reinvesting in lower-yielding assets due to sustained low interest rates, which compressed gross margins and affected investment returns. In response, MetLife adapted by maintaining diversified product offerings and proactively managing interest rate and product strategies, supported by disciplined asset/liability management (ALM) strategies including derivatives. This evolution shows a continuation of reinvestment challenges but a more diversified and proactive risk management approach by 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, BlackRock reported foreign income before taxes in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, including the UK, which directly affected their tax expense reconciliation at the 21% US federal rate. By 2024, the UK's Overseas Fund Regime (OFR), enacted in February 2022, required that consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled be found equivalent to the UK\u2019s regime in order to market those funds in the UK. This regulatory shift compelled BlackRock to reassess its compliance strategy for EU-domiciled funds, particularly those marketed to UK retail investors. The firm had to ensure alignment with UK consumer protection standards, which now directly influenced their fund distribution and compliance costs. This reflects a strategic pivot from a primarily tax-focused exposure in 2023 to a broader regulatory compliance challenge in 2024, particularly around equivalence determinations for EU jurisdictions under OFR.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AXP disclosed its certificates of deposit in denominations of $250,000 or more, indicating a focus on high-value deposit products. By 2024, AENB had become central to AXP's deposit funding strategy, offering FDIC-insured CDs as part of a broader direct deposit program that included high-yield savings and checking accounts. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 92% of these deposits were insured, showing a strategic emphasis on insured deposits to enhance customer confidence and reduce funding risk. This shift aligns with regulatory requirements introduced in August 2023, which mandated minimum levels of long-term debt for AENB and other institutions, influencing AXP's reliance on AENB for stable, insured funding sources.",

Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. direct deposits insured by the FDIC to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.\n\nIn August, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require covered bank holding companies such as American Express Company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external long-term debt and certain insured depository institutions such as AENB to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible internal long-term debt. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Capital and Liquidity Regulation' under 'Business' for more information.\n\n## DEPOSIT PROGRAMS\n\nWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category through the FDIC; as of December 31, 2024, approximately 92 percent of these deposits were insured. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. The direct deposit program offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account, certificates of deposit (CDs), business checking and consumer rewards checking account products available directly to customers. As of December 31, 2024, our direct deposit program had approximately 3.3 million accounts. AENB also sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. CDs carry stated maturities while high-yield savings account, checking account and third-party sweep deposit products do not. We manage the duration of our maturing obligations, including CDs, to reduce concentration and refinancing risk.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $139.4 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits.\n\nThe following table sets forth the average interest rates we paid on different types of deposits during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Changes in the average interest rate we paid on our deposits were primarily due to the impact of higher market interest rates offered for retail deposits.\n\n## TABLE 20: AVERAGE INTEREST RATES PAID ON DEPOSITS\n\n",

The use of social media and similar channels has the potential to intensify and accelerate such a decrease in confidence in soundness.\n\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB's capital levels. The FDIA's brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses.

This anti-takeover provision, coupled with Class A shares carrying one vote per share and Class B shares being non-voting, likely constrained MA's attractiveness as an acquisition target. By preserving this structure across both years, MA signaled continued insulation from external control pressures, which could reduce takeover risk but may also limit strategic partnership opportunities or its ability to pursue inorganic growth through acquisitions in a consolidating market.

We  may  be  unable  to  retain  or  to  attract  highly  qualified  employees.  The  market  for  key  personnel  is  highly competitive, particularly in technology and other skill areas significant to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit  laws  and  visa  regulations  and  related  enforcement  have  made  it  difficult  for  employees  to  work  in,  or  transfer  among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Moreover, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our workforce is working in either a remote or hybrid environment. Such environments  may  continue  after  the  pandemic  due  to  potential  resulting  trends,  and  could  impact  the  quality  of  our  corporate culture, as well as our ability to attract and retain talent. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork could harm our overall business and results of operations.\n\nWe rely on key personnel to lead with integrity and decency. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that is not consistent with our values, we could experience significant impact to our brand and reputation, as well as to our corporate culture.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOur efforts to enter into acquisitions, strategic investments or entry into new businesses could be impacted or prevented by  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  otherwise  result  in  issues  that  could  disrupt  our  business  and  harm  our  results  of operations or reputation.\n\nWe continue to evaluate our strategic acquisitions  of  complementary  businesses,  products  or  technologies,  as  well  as  acquiring interests in related joint ventures or other entities. As we do so, we face increasing regulatory scrutiny with respect to antitrust and other considerations that could impact these efforts. We also face competition for acquisition targets due to the nature of the market for technology companies. As a result, we could be prevented from successfully completing such acquisitions in the future. If we are not successful in these efforts, we could lose strategic opportunities that are dependent, in part, on inorganic growth.\n\nTo the extent we do make these acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them, despite original intentions and focused efforts. In addition, such an integration may divert management's time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Moreover, we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or  increase our revenue. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations, including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition.\n\nAny acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations, both directly as a result of the new business as well as in the other existing parts of our business, with which we would need to comply. This compliance could increase our costs, and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements. Additionally, targets that we acquire may have data practices that do not initially conform to our privacy and data protection standards and data governance model, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage.\n\n## Class A Common Stock and Governance Structure\n\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions and have an impact on change-in-control.\n\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover  provisions,  including  provisions  that  could  delay  or  prevent  entirely  a  merger  or  acquisition  that  our  stockholders consider favorable. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a  change  in  control,  which  could  harm  our  stock  price.  For  example,  subject  to  limited  exceptions,  our  amended  and  restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15% of any of the Class A common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power, or more than 15% of our total voting power. In addition:\n\n- our stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors\n- our stockholders are not entitled to act by written consent",

      "answer": "Bank of America increased its issuance of structured liabilities from $27.5B in 2023 to $33.4B in 2024 while simultaneously reducing its stake in Nonbank VIEs from $564M to $409M. This inverse relationship suggests a strategic shift in off-balance-sheet risk management, with the bank favoring structured liabilities\u2014complex instruments tied to market variables\u2014over reliance on Nonbank VIEs. The increased use of structured liabilities, which are more directly tied to market performance and modeled valuations, may indicate an effort to gain more control over risk exposure or to optimize capital efficiency. At the same time, the reduced stake in Nonbank VIEs could reflect a de-risking strategy, potentially moving away from off-balance-sheet entities that may carry higher unpredictability or complexity in risk modeling.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG was subject to NAIC Designations that used third-party modeling to assign improved ratings to RMBS compared to traditional rating agencies, as outlined in the 2022 10-K filing. This methodology could have affected how AIG reported the fair value and risk profile of its RMBS holdings. By 2023, AIG disclosed that its RMBS portfolio had a total fair value of $11.4 billion, with $1.168 billion in gross unrealized losses, compared to $11.958 billion total fair value and $1.475 billion in gross unrealized losses in 2022. Specifically, the short-term RMBS holdings (less than 12 months) saw a decrease in fair value from $10.953 billion to $4.154 billion, while long-term RMBS (12 months or more) increased from $1.005 billion to $7.246 billion. This suggests a strategic shift toward longer-duration RMBS in 2023, potentially influenced by the more favorable NAIC Designations from 2022 that may have allowed for more favorable capital treatment or risk assessment under statutory reporting rules.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory capital obligations of Morgan Stanley Capital Services (MSCS) under the CFTC change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this imply about Morgan Stanley's evolving compliance posture in derivative trading?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MSCS was explicitly subject to both SEC and CFTC capital requirements as part of its registration as a security-based swap dealer and swap dealer. By 2024, while still subject to these dual capital requirements, the broader context showed that other subsidiaries like MSMS and MSESE were complying with home-country capital rules in lieu of CFTC requirements, suggesting a more coordinated global compliance strategy. This implies that Morgan Stanley maintained strict adherence to U.S. regulatory expectations for its core non-bank security-based swap dealer (MSCS), while leveraging substituted compliance in other jurisdictions to manage capital efficiency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MS(2023) \u2192 MSCS: Morgan Stanley's 2023 filing explicitly listed MSCS as its primary non-bank security-based swap dealer, registered with both the SEC and CFTC.",
        "Hop 2: MSCS \u2192 CFTC Capital Requirements: In 2023, MSCS was directly subject to the capital requirements of both the SEC and CFTC as part of its regulatory obligations.",
        "Hop 3: CFTC Capital Requirements \u2190 MS(2024): In 2024, while MSCS remained under CFTC capital requirements, other international subsidiaries like MSMS and MSESE were using home-country substituted compliance, indicating a strategic shift in capital management."

      "question": "How did JPMorgan's integration of physical climate risk into its broader risk management framework evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what organizational adjustments were made to strengthen this focus?",
      "answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan acknowledged physical risk as part of climate risk, noting that it could increase credit and operational risk by affecting borrowers\u2019 repayment capacity and collateral value, as well as pose threats to facilities and people (JPM_10k_2023.pdf, page 146). However, it was not yet fully embedded within the firm\u2019s dedicated risk governance structure. By 2024, JPMorgan had established a dedicated Climate Risk Management function responsible for setting policies, standards, and stress-testing mechanisms to assess climate-related financial impacts (JPM_10k_2024.pdf, page 152). This new function was integrated into the broader risk governance framework, with responsibilities cascading down to Line of Business (LOB) Risk Committees and oversight from the Board Risk Committee. This evolution reflects a strategic shift from viewing physical risk as a secondary concern within operational risk to a more structured, firmwide approach with dedicated oversight and measurement tools.",

Climate change is v iewed as a driv er of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk.\n\nPhysical risk inv olv es economic costs and financial losses due to a changing climate. Acute physical risk driv ers include the increased frequency or sev erity of climate and weather ev ents, such as floods, wildfires and tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk driv ers include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea lev el rise, persistent changes in precipitation lev els and increases in av erage ambient temperatures.\n\nTransition risk inv olv es the financial and economic consequences of society's shift toward a lower-carbon economy. Transition risk driv ers include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.\n\n## Organization and management\n\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing climate risks that may impact the Firm.\n\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:\n\n- Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to support identification, escalation, monitoring and management of climate risk across the Firm\n- Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential climate-related financial and economic impacts to the Firm\n- Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the identification, assessment and management of climate risks present in their business activ ities and for the adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations.\n\n152\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nThe Firm's framework and strategy for managing climate risk is integrated into the Firm's risk gov ernance structure.

By 2024, the company's involvement in CMBS-backed Structured Products shifted significantly, as it now describes its role as limited to that of a 'passive investor' in mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities, indicating a reduced risk profile. This change in posture is further reinforced by the 2024 disclosure that MetLife's involvement in Structured Products is now restricted to passive investment, with no active management or substantial equity stakes. The evolution from direct CMBS holdings with meaningful Level 3 exposure in 2023 to a passive, non-managing role in Structured Products in 2024 suggests a strategic move to de-risk and reduce complexity in its fixed income portfolio.",

The maximum exposure to loss relating to OLPI, REJV  and mortgage loans is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unrecognized unfunded commitments. For certain of its investments in other invested assets, the Company's return is in the form of income tax credits which are guaranteed by creditworthy third parties. For such investments, the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by income tax credits guaranteed by third parties. Such a maximum loss would be expected to occur only upon bankruptcy of the issuer or investee.\n\n(2) For variable interests in Structured Products included within fixed maturity securities AFS, the Company's involvement is limited to that of a passive investor in mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities generally issued by trusts that do not have substantial equity.\n\nIn connection with the reinsurance transaction with subsidiaries of G lobal Atlantic, collateral securing the reinsurance transaction was transferred to trusts that do not have substantial equity. The Company does not have a carrying amount related to the trusts but does manage a portion of the invested assets. For managing these assets,  the  Company  will  receive  an  investment  management  fee  which  represents  a  variable  interest.  The  Company's  max imum  ex posure  to  loss  is  limited  to  the investment management fee revenue that has been earned but not yet received. See Note 9 for further information on this reinsurance transaction.\n\nAs described in Note 24, the Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in the normal course of business. Excluding these commitments, the Company did not provide financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

      "question": "How did MET's $23.5 billion investment in real estate funds in 2022 influence its valuation model risk exposure in 2023, particularly given the reliance on unobservable inputs and periodic appraisals?",
      "answer": "MET's $23.5 billion investment in real estate funds in 2022, as reported in its 10-K filing, significantly influenced its valuation model risk exposure in 2023. These real estate funds were valued using NAV-based models that rely on unobservable inputs and periodic appraisals, as outlined in the 2023 10-K. By 2023, this valuation methodology introduced model risk, as the reliance on unobservable inputs made the valuations more subjective and less transparent. This risk was compounded by the long fund terms (8\u201310 years), which limited liquidity and increased exposure to potential valuation inaccuracies over time. MET acknowledged in its 2023 filing that such model dependencies could negatively impact its financial assessments and reserves, highlighting a clear temporal evolution from the 2022 investment strategy to the 2023 risk profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET(2022) \u2192 Real Estate Funds: MET had a $23.5 billion investment in real estate funds in 2022, with exposure limited to carrying value plus $7.6 billion in unfunded commitments.",
        "Hop 2: Real Estate Funds \u2192 Valuation Models: Real estate funds were valued using NAV-based models that rely on unobservable inputs and periodic appraisals, as described in the 2023 filing.",
        "Hop 3: Valuation Models \u2190 MET(2023): By 2023, MET explicitly stated that its assumptions, models, and reserves could be negatively impacted by reliance on complex or inaccurate valuation models."

Excludes  assets  held  in  trust  related  to reinsurance agreements between wholly-owned subsidiaries of $2.1 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n(2) The  Company  has  pledged  invested  assets  in  connection  with  various  agreements  and  transactions,  including  funding agreements  (see  Note  4),  derivative  transactions  (see  Note  9),  secured  debt  and  short-term  debt  related  to  repurchase agreements (see Note 13), and a collateral financing arrangement (see Note 14).\n\nSee  '-  Securities  Lending  Transactions  and  Repurchase  Agreements'  for  information  regarding  securities  supporting securities  lending  transactions  and  repurchase  agreements  and  Note  7  for  information  regarding  investments  designated  to  the closed  block.  In  addition,  the  Company's  investment  in  FHLB  common  stock,  included  within  other  invested  assets,  which  is considered restricted until redeemed by the issuers, was $769 million and $814 million, at redemption value, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Collectively Significant Equity Method Investments\n\nThe Company holds investments in real estate joint ventures, real estate funds and other limited partnership interests consisting of private equity funds, hedge funds, real estate joint ventures, real estate funds and other funds. The portion of these investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of $23.5 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company's maximum exposure to loss related to these equity method investments is limited to the carrying value of these investments plus unfunded commitments of $7.6 billion at December 31, 2021. Except for certain real estate joint ventures and certain funds, the Company's investments in its remaining real estate funds and other limited partnership interests are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not participate in the management of the entities.\n\nAs described in Note 1, the Company generally recognizes its share of earnings in its equity method investments within net investment income using a three-month lag in instances where the investee's financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee's reporting period differs from the Company's reporting period. Aggregate net investment income from these equity method investments exceeded 10% of the Company's consolidated pre-tax income (loss) for the three most recent annual periods.\n\nThe following aggregated summarized financial data reflects the latest available financial information and does not represent the  Company's  proportionate  share  of  the  assets,  liabilities,  or  earnings  of  such  entities. Aggregate  total  assets  of  these  entities totaled  $1.1  trillion  and  $704.5  billion  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively. Aggregate  total  liabilities  of  these  entities totaled $149.4 billion and $99.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Aggregate net income (loss) of these entities totaled  $231.0  billion,  $41.6  billion  and  $47.0  billion  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.

          "chunk_text": "ITEM 1 |\n\nBusiness\n\nThe NAIC has undertaken a multi-pronged effort to determine whether additional standards, safeguards or disclosures are required in connection with certain investments by U.S. insurance companies, including related party investments, structured securities and other complex assets.\n\nIn December 2020, the NAIC amended the Holding Company M odels to incorporate a Group Capital Calculation (GCC) requirement, which requires the ultimate controlling person of every U.S. insurer to submit GCC reports to the insurance group's lead state insurance regulator on an annual basis unless an exemption applies. These GCC provisions were incorporated in New York State laws in August 2023, making AIG formally subject to the GCC beginning in 2024. The GCC is intended to serve as an analytical tool for evaluating a firm's capital position at the group level and is not intended as a prescribed group capital requirement.\n\nU.S. states have state insurance guaranty associations in which insurers admitted in the state are required by law to be members. M ember insurers may be assessed by the associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The aggregate assessments levied against us have not been material to our financial condition in any of the past three years.\n\n## Federal\n\nAt the U.S. federal level, A IG is impacted by the activ ities of policy makers and by  the laws and regulations enforced by various federal agencies.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), signed into law in 2010, brought about extensive changes to financial regulation in the United States and established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to serve as the central insurance authority in the federal government. While not serving a regulatory function, FIO performs certain duties related to the business of insurance and has authority to collect information on the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. In addition, FIO monitors market access issues, represents the United States in international insurance forums and has authority to determine if certain regulations are preempted by covered agreements. FIO's approval is required to subject a financial company whose largest U.S. subsidiary is an insurer to the special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the FDIC pursuant to Dodd-Frank. U.S. insurance subsidiaries of any such financial company, however, would remain subject to rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings under state insurance laws.\n\nFIO also assists the Secretary of the Treasury in administering the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance A ct (TRIA ), enacted in 2002 to support insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the U.S. The program was continued under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct of 2019 (TRIPRA ) through December 31, 2027 and is intended to provide reinsurance coverage from the federal government in limited circumstances for certified acts of terrorism that exceed a certain threshold of industry losses.\n\nTitle I of Dodd-Frank established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), which is authorized to determine that certain nonbank financial companies be designated as nonbank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and enhanced prudential standards. Designation by the Council of any nonbank SIFI is subject to certain statutory and regulatory standards and to the Council's guidance. The Council may also recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that insurers or other nonbank financial services companies engage in.\n\nTitle V  of Dodd-Frank authorizes the United States to enter into covered agreements with foreign governments or regulatory entities regarding the business of insurance and reinsurance. On September 22, 2017, the U.S. and the European Union (EU) entered into such an agreement, and on December 18, 2018, the U.S. signed a covered agreement with the United Kingdom (UK), which is similar to the agreement with the EU. Under the agreements, A IG is subject to consolidated group supervision by its relevant U.S. insurance supervisors only, and generally does not have to satisfy EU Solvency II capital, reporting and governance requirements at the consolidated group level. The covered agreements also required various U.S. reinsurance collateral reforms, which were adopted by all U.S. states.\n\nTitle V II of Dodd-Frank provides for significantly  increased regulation of, and restrictions on, derivativ es markets and transactions that have affected various activities of insurance and other financial services companies, including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps, including security-based swaps, (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated swap execution facilities for certain swaps (other than security-based swaps) and (iii) margin and collateral requirements.\n\n## International\n\nIn the UK, the Prudential Regulation A uthority (PRA ) is the lead prudential supervisor for our UK insurance operations and the Financial Conduct A uthority has oversight of A IG's insurance operations for consumer protection and competition matters. The Society of Lloyd's also provides regulatory oversight of A IG's Lloyd's M anaging Agent, Talbot Underwriting Limited.\n\n8\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, MET acknowledged that during periods of market disruption\u2014such as rising interest rates or infrequent trading\u2014they relied on more subjective judgments, assumptions, or methods for asset valuations, which could result in estimated fair values that significantly varied by period and potentially exceeded the investment's sale price. By 2023, MET further emphasized that considerable judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates, noting that different assumptions or valuation methodologies could materially affect the estimated fair value amounts. This indicates that the firm's fair value estimation process became increasingly sensitive to methodological choices and subjective inputs over time, raising concerns about the consistency and reliability of these valuations in volatile markets.",

We may face unfavorable conditions in privately-placed fixed income securities, private structured credit, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds. Our investments may suffer reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption or for other reasons. In addition, central banks' efforts to provide market liquidity or otherwise address market conditions may not be successful or sufficient. We may realize losses that harm our financial  metrics,  which  could  harm  our  compliance  with  our  credit  requirements  and  rating  agency  capital  adequacy measures.\n\nWe  may  face  similar  risks  if  we  are  required  under  our  securities  lending  program  to  return  significant  amounts  of  cash collateral that we have invested. Our securities lending activities and profitability may decrease.\n\n## We May Have to Pledge Collateral or Make Payments in Derivatives Transactions\n\nWe may have to pledge additional collateral and increase payments we make under our derivatives transactions. Regulators, clearinghouses, or counterparties may restrict or eliminate eligible collateral, increase our collateral requirements, or charge us to pledge such collateral, which would increase our costs, reduce our investment income, and harm our liquidity.\n\n## We  May  Change  Our  Securities  and  Investments  Valuation,  or  Take  Allowances  and  Impairments  on  Our  Investments,  or Change Our Methodologies, Estimations, and Assumptions\n\nDuring periods of market disruption or rapidly changing market conditions, such as significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, or infrequent trading, or when market data is limited, our assets may become less liquid. We may base our asset valuations on less observable and more subjective judgments, assumptions, or methods that may result in estimated fair values that significantly vary by period, and may exceed the investment's sale price. The estimated fair value of our securities may also decrease due to changes in valuation methods and assumptions.\n\n## Business Risks\n\n## Our Actual Claims or Other Results May Differ From Our Estimates, Assumptions, or Models\n\nIf our actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying underwriting, reserving, and other assumptions we used in establishing claim liabilities, we could be required to reduce DAC or VOBA, increase our liabilities, or incur higher costs.\n\nThe amounts that we will ultimately pay to settle our liabilities, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future, may vary from what we expect. We may change our liability assumptions and increase our liabilities based on actual experience and accounting requirements. Our operating practices and procedures that support our policyholders and contractholder obligation assumptions, such as obtaining, accumulating, and filtering data, and our use of technology, such as database analysis and electronic communications, may affect our reserve estimates. If these practices and procedures do not accurately produce the data to support our assumptions or cause us to change our assumptions, or if enhanced technological tools become available to us, we may change those assumptions and procedures, as well as our reserves. If any of our operating practices and procedures do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such deviations or errors may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition. We may change our assumptions, models, or reserves due to changes in longevity. Increases in the prevalence and accuracy of genetic testing, or restrictions on its use, may exacerbate adverse selection risks.\n\nPandemics and other public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) have caused and may continue to cause increased claims  under  many  of  our  policies  (for  example,  life,  disability,  leave,  long-term  care,  major  medical  and  supplemental  health products), raising our resulting costs. Governments or others may fail to produce accurate population and impact data that we use in our estimates, assumptions, models, or reserves, such as death rates, infections, morbidity, hospitalization, or illness. This may cause or exacerbate any of the risks related to our estimates or assumptions. Pandemics and other public health issues may cause related or consequential long-term economic, social, political, policy, regulatory, business, demographic, or other changes to our claims or other  areas  subject  to  estimates,  assumptions,  models,  or  reserves.  We  may  not  accurately  predict,  prepare,  and  adjust  to  these changes.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG specifically noted that losses reported in certain tables were not covered by the ADC (likely referring to reinsurance or loss recovery mechanisms), indicating a lack of offset for incurred losses in Personal Lines, which include Extended Warranty products. In 2024, while the structure of UK/Europe and Japan Personal Insurance remained consistent\u2014still including Extended Warranty\u2014there was no explicit mention of unrecovered losses or ADC exclusions, suggesting a potential improvement in loss recovery mechanisms or a change in reinsurance strategy. The absence of a statement about uncovered losses in 2024 implies that AIG may have adjusted its reinsurance or internal loss adjustment practices for the Personal Lines segment, particularly affecting Extended Warranty products.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG(2023) \u2192 Extended Warranty: AIG explicitly stated that losses in certain tables were not covered by the ADC, indicating a lack of reinsurance or recovery for those losses in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOperational risk is the risk of an adv erse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external ev ents impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm's activ ities and can manifest itself in v arious ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary ev ents beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behav ior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of v endors or other third party prov iders to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate lev els in light of the Firm's financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory env ironments in which it operates.\n\n## Operational Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Firm's Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk ('CCOR') Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to gov ern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm's operational risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Governance\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\n\nThe Firm's Global Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO') and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitativ e Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitativ e Risk Appetite and are independent of the respectiv e businesses or functions they ov ersee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Gov ernance and Ov ersight Policy that is rev iewed and approv ed by the Board Risk Committee periodically.\n\n## Operational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiv eness of their respectiv e control environment to assess circumstances in which controls hav e failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firm's Operational Risk and Compliance organization ('Operational Risk and Compliance')\n\nprov ides ov ersight of and challenge to these ev aluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk ev ents and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes ev aluating the effectiv eness of the control env ironments and reporting the results to senior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitativ e means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach ('LDA') statistical model, which simulates the projected frequency and sev erity of operational risk losses based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss ov er a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence lev el. T he LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses ev en after the issues or business activ ities giv ing rise to the losses hav e been remediated or reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm's operational risk capital methodology, which uses the Adv anced Measurement Approach ('AMA'), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management's view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and ev aluation of key business env ironment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and dev elops a forward looking v iew of material operational risk ev ents that may occur in a stressed env ironment. The Firm's operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm's CCAR and other stress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97-107 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\n\n## Operational Risk Monitoring and Testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed $4,269 million in Structured Securities AFS, which included RMBS as a key component. By 2023, this exposure increased to $4,551 million. This reflects a strategic shift or continued emphasis on structured products, particularly those backed by residential mortgages, within their Level 3 fair value hierarchy.

      "answer": "In 2023, Visa had 622 million shares of Class B-1 common stock outstanding, which were non-transferable until the resolution of U.S. covered litigation and convertible into Class A common stock upon transfer to non-Visa Members. In 2024, following the approval of certificate amendments on January 23, 2024, and the May 6, 2024 exchange offer, 241 million shares of Class B-1 were retired, and 120 million Class B-2 and 48 million Class C shares were issued, with Class B-2 shares having double the conversion rate sensitivity. By September 30, 2024, total Class B shares (B-1 and B-2 combined) had decreased to 125 million from 245 million in 2023. This structural shift affected the Class B to Class A conversion mechanics and voting rights, as Class B stockholders only had voting rights in limited circumstances and their votes were tied to the conversion rate, which had changed due to the exchange program and redenomination.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: V(2023) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Visa disclosed details about the Class B common stock structure, including its non-transferable status and conversion into Class A common stock under certain conditions.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The relationship between Class A and Class B common stock was defined by voting rights and conversion mechanics, with Class B stockholders' voting power tied to the conversion rate into Class A shares.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 V(2024): In 2024, Visa disclosed the impact of the exchange offer and redenomination, showing a reduction in Class B shares and changes in conversion rate sensitivity, which affected the interplay with Class A shares."

      "answer": "MetLife's valuation methodology for Separate Accounts categorized under Level 2 assets remained consistent between 2022 and 2024 disclosures. In both years, the company stated that the estimated fair value of Level 2 Separate Accounts was based on reported Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by fund managers, reflecting the amount at which transfers into and out of the respective accounts were effected. Both disclosures emphasized that these Separate Accounts were primarily invested in liquid and readily marketable securities, with reasonable levels of price transparency that could be corroborated through observable market data.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife engaged independent investment consultants to evaluate the investment risk of its pension and postretirement medical plan assets, focusing on asset-liability alignment, portfolio impact of asset allocations, and recommending diversified strategies to minimize risk concentrations. By 2024, MetLife disclosed that investment risk was embedded in certain derivatives, such as equity-indexed annuity contracts and funds withheld under reinsurance agreements, which were marked-to-fair-value with changes impacting net income. This suggests a shift or expansion in how investment risk was managed and disclosed \u2014 from a consultant-driven, asset-focused evaluation in 2022 to a more structured, derivative-linked risk exposure framework in 2024, indicating a broader integration of investment risk into product design and financial reporting.",

These  include  qualified  pension  plans,  postretirement  medical  plans  and  certain  retiree  life insurance coverage. The assets of these U.S. subsidiaries' qualified pension plans are held in an insurance group annuity contract, and the vast majority of the assets of the postretirement medical plan are held in a trust which largely utilizes insurance contracts to hold the assets. All of these contracts are issued by the Company's insurance affiliates, and the assets under the contracts are held in insurance separate accounts that have been established by the Company. The underlying assets of the separate accounts are principally  comprised  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments,  fixed  maturity  securities  AFS,  equity  securities, derivatives, real estate and private equity investments.

These  include  qualified  pension  plans,  postretirement  medical  plans  and  certain  retiree  life insurance coverage. The assets of these U.S. subsidiaries' qualified pension plans are held in an insurance group annuity contract, and the vast majority of the assets of the postretirement medical plan are held in a trust which largely utilizes insurance contracts to hold the assets. All of these contracts are issued by the Company's insurance affiliates, and the assets under the contracts are held in insurance separate accounts that have been established by the Company. The underlying assets of the separate accounts are principally  comprised  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments,  fixed  maturity  securities  AFS,  equity  securities, derivatives, real estate and private equity investments.

      "question": "How did the shift in unobservable input ranges for RMBS valuations between 2022 and 2023 reflect changes in Capital One's reliance on vendor pricing assumptions, particularly in terms of yield and default rate volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One noted that vendor pricing services could only provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions, resulting in a composite summary of available data (Hop 1). By 2023, the company reported a detailed range of unobservable inputs for RMBS, including yield (2\u201319%) and default rates (0\u201310%), derived from discounted cash flows using vendor pricing (Hop 3). This indicates a stronger integration of vendor pricing models with more granular and volatile assumptions, suggesting increased reliance on external pricing services and more detailed modeling of RMBS risk factors over time (Hop 2).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COF(2022) \u2192 Vendor Pricing: COF disclosed limitations in obtaining unobservable input data from vendor pricing services due to licensing restrictions, leading to a composite summary for Level 3 securities.",
        "Hop 2: Vendor Pricing \u2192 RMBS: Vendor pricing services were used to determine the fair value of RMBS, with unobservable inputs such as yield, default rates, and loss severity playing a key role in valuation models.",
        "Hop 3: RMBS \u2190 COF(2023): COF provided specific RMBS valuation input ranges (e.g., yield: 2\u201319%, default rate: 0\u201310%) from vendor pricing models, showing increased transparency and reliance on external assumptions."

(3)\n\nThe fair value of RMBS as of January 1, 2020 includes a cumulative adjustment of $4 million from the adoption of the CECL standard. (4)\n\n## Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Inputs\n\nGenerally, uncertainties in fair value measurements of financial instruments, such as changes in unobservable inputs, may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction  for  a  given  change  in  another  input.  In  general,  an  increase  in  the  discount  rate,  default  rates,  loss  severity  or  credit spreads,  in  isolation,  would  result  in  a  decrease  in  the  fair  value  measurement.  In  addition,  an  increase  in  default  rates  would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.\n\n## Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  to  determine  the  fair  values  of  our  Level  3  financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they  provide  a  valuation. As  a  result,  the  unobservable  input  information  for  the  securities  available  for  sale  presented  below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance subsidiaries  are  subject  to  regulatory  restrictions  on  the  payment  of  dividends  imposed  by  the  regulators  of  their  respective domiciles.  See  Note  16  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  dividend  limitation  for  U.S.  insurance subsidiaries  is  generally  based  on  the  surplus  to  policyholders  at  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  calendar  year  and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.\n\nThe  table  below  sets  forth  the  dividends  permitted  to  be  paid  by  MetLife,  Inc.'s  primary  U.S.  insurance  subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 19. E quity (continued)\n\n## Statutory Equity and Income\n\nThe states of domicile of MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. insurance subsidiaries each impose risk-based capital ('RBC') requirements that were developed by the NAIC. American Life does not write business in Delaware or any other U.S. state and, as such, is exempt from RBC requirements by Delaware law. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio  of  a  company's  total  adjusted  capital,  calculated  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  the  NAIC  ('TAC'),  to  its  authorized  control  level  RBC,  calculated  in  the  manner prescribed by the NAIC ('authorized control level RBC'), based on the statutory-based financial statements. Companies below specific trigger levels or ratios are classified by their respective levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences is twice authorized control level RBC  ('Company Action  Level  RBC').  While  not  required  by  or  filed  with  insurance  regulators,  the  Company  also  calculates  an  internally  defined  combined  RBC ratio  ('Statement-Based  Combined  RBC  Ratio'),  which  is  determined  by  dividing  the  sum  of  TAC  for  MetLife,  Inc.'s  principal  U.S.  insurance  subsidiaries,  ex cluding American Life, by the sum of Company Action Level RBC for such subsidiaries. The Company's Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 360% and in excess of 380% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, all non-exempted U.S. insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded Company Action Level RBC for all periods presented.\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s foreign insurance operations are regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions in which each entity operates and are subject to minimum capital and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions before corrective action commences. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the adjusted capital of American Life's insurance subsidiary in Japan, the Company's largest foreign insurance operation, was in excess of three times the 200% solvency margin ratio that would require corrective action. Excluding Japan, the aggregate required and actual capital and surplus of the Company's other foreign insurance operations was $4.0 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively, as of the date of the most recent fiscal year-end capital adequacy calculation for each jurisdiction, ex ceeding the respective minimum capital and solvency requirements.\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries prepare statutory-basis financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile or applicable foreign jurisdiction. The NAIC has adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles ('Statutory Codification').  Statutory  Codification  is  intended  to  standardize  regulatory  accounting  and  reporting  to  state  insurance  departments.  However,  statutory  accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices. Modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the effect of Statutory Codification on the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\n\nStatutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing FPBs using different actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.\n\nIn addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net deferred income tax assets resulting from temporary differences between statutory accounting principles basis and tax basis not expected to reverse and become recoverable within three years. Further, statutory accounting principles do not give recognition to purchase accounting adjustments. MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. insurance subsidiaries have no material state prescribed accounting practices, except as described below.\n\nNew Y ork has adopted certain prescribed accounting practices, primarily consisting of the continuous Commissioners' Annuity Reserve V aluation Method, which impacts deferred annuities, and the New Y ork Special Considerations Letter, which mandates certain assumptions in asset adequacy testing. The collective impact of these prescribed accounting practices decreased the statutory capital and surplus of MLIC by $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, compared to what capital and surplus would have been had it been measured under NAIC guidance.\n\nAmerican  Life  calculates  its  policyholder  reserves  on  insurance  written  in  each  foreign  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  reserve  standards  required  by  such jurisdiction. Additionally, American Life's insurance subsidiaries are valued based on each respective subsidiary's underlying local statutory equity, adjusted in a manner consistent with the reporting prescribed for its branch operations. The prescribed practice exempts American Life from calculating and disclosing the impact to its statutory capital and surplus.\n\nThe tables below present amounts for MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

Correspondingly, the number of Class A shares increased from 1,594 in 2023 to 1,733 in 2024, a net increase of 139 shares, which aligns with the conversion activity. This shift in share structure contributed to a broader change in equity, with total equity increasing from $38,733 million in 2023 to $39,137 million in 2024, reflecting the ongoing transformation in V's capital structure driven by Class B to Class A conversions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, JPM explicitly integrated Transition Risk into its Climate Risk Management framework, establishing policies, metrics, and stress testing mechanisms to assess climate-related financial impacts, including potential regulatory changes (JPM_10k_2023.pdf:page_148:chunk_1). The MS_10k_2023 evidence highlights that Transition Risk could amplify Compliance Risk through increased legal and regulatory scrutiny, including new disclosure requirements and carbon taxes (MS_10k_2023.pdf:page_78:chunk_1). By 2024, JPM formalized Compliance Risk as a distinct risk category with its own governance page (JPM_10k_2024.pdf:page_97:chunk_2), suggesting that earlier Transition Risk disclosures and regulatory risk modeling directly informed the structure and prioritization of Compliance Risk as a standalone function, especially in anticipation of climate-related regulatory developments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Morgan Stanley maintained a controlling stake in MSBNA, which was subject to the phased-in CECL deferral impact starting in 2022. The deferral allowed MSBNA to delay the effect of CECL adoption on risk-based capital ratios, RWA, and leverage calculations, with the impact phased in at 50% from January 1, 2023. By 2024, the deferral impact increased to 75%, directly affecting Morgan Stanley\u2019s consolidated regulatory capital framework. This evolution shows how Morgan Stanley\u2019s ownership structure in MSBNA enabled a gradual adaptation to CECL\u2019s financial impact, influencing capital planning and regulatory compliance strategies.",

Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Regulatory Capital Framework\n\nThe  Firm  is  an  FHC  under  the  Bank  Holding  Company  Act  of  1956,  as amended,  and  is  subject  to  the  regulation  and  oversight  of  the  Board  of Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System  ('Federal  Reserve').  The  Federal Reserve  establishes capital requirements for the Firm, including 'wellcapitalized' standards, and evaluates the Firm's compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm's U.S. bank subsidiaries, including, among others, MSBNA and MSPBNA  (together, 'U.S. Bank Subsidiaries'). The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and also implement certain provisions of the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street  Reform and  Consumer  Protection Act.  In  addition,  many  of  the  Firm's  regulated  subsidiaries  are  subject  to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as swap  dealers  with  the  CFTC  or  conditionally  registered  as  security-based swap  dealers  with the SEC  or  registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Requirements\n\nThe  Firm  is  required  to  maintain  minimum  risk-based  and  leverage-based capital  ratios  under  regulatory  capital  requirements.  A  summary  of  the calculations of regulatory capital and RWA follows.\n\nRisk-Based  Regulatory  Capital. Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to  Common  Equity  Tier  1  ('CET1')  capital,  Tier  1  capital  and  Total  capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus the Firm's capital buffer requirement. Capital  requirements  require  certain  adjustments  to,  and  deductions  from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.\n\nCECL  Deferral. Beginning on January 1, 2020, the Firm elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on its risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA,  adjusted average assets  and supplementary  leverage  exposure  calculations,  over  a  five-year  transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022 and were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024. The deferral impacts were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.\n\n## Capital B uffer R equirements\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG reported favorable development in Personal Lines driven by subrogation recoveries from catastrophe events, including those within the Extended Warranty segment. However, in 2023, the 10-K explicitly states that losses reported in the Extended Warranty category were not covered by the Asbestos Deductible Coverage (ADC). This means that while certain 2022 losses in Personal Lines (including Extended Warranty) may have benefited from ADC-related recoveries, 2023 losses did not, potentially leading to a less favorable loss ratio for Extended Warranty in 2023 compared to 2022. This contrast in reinsurance support highlights a direct impact on loss experience due to the exclusion of ADC coverage in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Capital One adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and introduced a new framework for reporting financial difficulty modifications (FDMs). Under the new guidance, FDMs are accumulated and reported on a rolling twelve-month basis, with performance tracked for each loan that received a modification during the year ended December 31, 2023. This marked a shift from prior TDR disclosures, which were based on a different accounting framework and were not directly comparable to FDMs due to differences in definitions and reporting requirements. In 2024, Capital One continued to disclose FDMs under the new standard, confirming the ongoing use of the ASU 2022-02 framework and signaling a structural change in how loan modifications for financially distressed borrowers are reported, with greater focus on performance tracking and vintage disclosures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG applied frequency/severity, loss development, and IBNR factor methods to set reserves for short-tail product lines like Homeowners' Insurance, which is part of Personal Lines. This approach was critical due to the rapid emergence of claims and the potential for significant salvage and subrogation recoveries. By 2023, AIG continued to classify Personal Lines, including Homeowners' Insurance, as generally short-tail in nature, indicating consistent treatment of risk characteristics. However, the explicit mention of reserving methodologies in 2022 suggests a more detailed analytical focus on risk quantification that may have informed the 2023 reporting. This implies a stable but refined risk management approach for Homeowners' Insurance within Personal Lines across the two years.",

          "chunk_text": "## Reserving Process and Methodology\n\nU.S. Personal Insurance consists of accident and health and personal lines. Accident and health products include voluntary and sponsor-paid personal accident and supplemental health products for individuals, employees, associations and other organizations as well as a broad range of travel insurance products and services for leisure and business travelers. Personal lines include automobile and homeowners' insurance, extended warranty, and consumer specialty products, such as identity theft and credit card protection. Personal lines also provides insurance for high net worth individuals offered through AIG Private Client Group, including auto, homeowners, umbrella, yacht, fine art and collections insurance. Personal lines are generally short-tail in nature and can reflect significant salvage and subrogation recoveries.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by line of business and may separately review various sub-segments, such as specific accident and health products and property damage versus liability for personal lines products.\n\nFrequency/severity methods, loss development methods, and IBNR factor methods are used alone or in combination to set reserves for short-tail product lines such as personal property.\n\nFrequency/severity and loss development methods are utilized for domestic personal auto product lines.\n\nFor these classes of business, reliance is placed on frequency/severity methods as claim counts emerge quickly for personal auto. Frequency/severity methods allow for more immediate analysis of resulting loss trends and comparisons to industry and other diagnostic metrics. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques.\n\n## UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $210 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by recognition of large loss activity in Financial PI in the UK and Commercial D&amp;O in Europe.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $258 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by Financial Lines in the UK and Europe and Excess Casualty in Europe as we continue to see increased severity of large losses in these classes.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $161 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by increased large loss activity in recent accident years, particularly related to UK directors and officers class action suits against insureds with global exposure, and increased frequency and severity in European casualty for auto liability and employers liability. This was slightly offset by a benefit from an increase in the Ogden rates in the UK used to value long duration claims.\n\n274 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did MetLife's fair value management strategy for Separate Accounts evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what were the implications for earnings stability due to the offsetting of asset and liability valuations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that its Separate Account Assets totaled $199.97 billion, with a breakdown across fair value hierarchies (Level 1: $91.85 billion, Level 2: $107.04 billion, Level 3: $1.09 billion). These assets were directly tied to Separate Account Liabilities, as confirmed by the AIG 2023 filing, which stated that Separate Account Liabilities represent the contract holder's account balance in those same assets and are equal and offsetting to total Separate Account Assets. By 2023, MetLife explicitly noted that changes in the fair value of Separate Account Assets were fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders within Separate Account Liabilities, ensuring that these changes were not recorded in net income. This reflects a continuation of a strategy to stabilize earnings by isolating investment performance in the Separate Accounts from the company's core financial results, while still transparently reflecting the fair value changes in the rollforward disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET(2022) \u2192 Separate Account Assets: MetLife disclosed the fair value of its Separate Account Assets in 2022, totaling $199.97 billion, with detailed breakdowns across Level 1, 2, and 3 valuations.",
        "Hop 2: Separate Account Assets \u2192 Separate Account Liabilities: AIG's 2023 filing clarifies that Separate Account Liabilities are equal and offsetting to the value of Separate Account Assets, directly linking the two entities.",
        "Hop 3: Separate Account Liabilities \u2190 MET(2023): In 2023, MetLife emphasized that changes in Separate Account Asset values were fully offset by changes in Separate Account Liabilities, with no impact on net income, maintaining earnings stability."

      "question": "How did MET's 2022 investment in real estate funds influence its exposure to loan portfolio risks in 2024, particularly in light of the firm's evolving investment strategy and market volatility impacts described in the 2024 filings?",
      "answer": "MET's 2022 investment in real estate funds, which included a carrying value of $23.5 billion and unfunded commitments of $7.6 billion, was part of a broader passive investment strategy. According to GS_10k_2024.pdf, real estate funds often invest globally in loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations, and property. By 2024, MET's exposure to loan portfolios\u2014highlighted in MET_10k_2024.pdf\u2014was significantly impacted by market volatility, including risks from potential defaults, downgrades, and liquidity constraints. The chain reveals that MET's earlier investment in real estate funds indirectly increased its sensitivity to loan portfolio risks over time, as these funds were exposed to loan assets that were vulnerable to economic downturns and regulatory changes. This evolution underscores a strategic risk MET faced due to its indirect investment chain through real estate funds into loan portfolios.",

Excludes  assets  held  in  trust  related  to reinsurance agreements between wholly-owned subsidiaries of $2.1 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n(2) The  Company  has  pledged  invested  assets  in  connection  with  various  agreements  and  transactions,  including  funding agreements  (see  Note  4),  derivative  transactions  (see  Note  9),  secured  debt  and  short-term  debt  related  to  repurchase agreements (see Note 13), and a collateral financing arrangement (see Note 14).\n\nSee  '-  Securities  Lending  Transactions  and  Repurchase  Agreements'  for  information  regarding  securities  supporting securities  lending  transactions  and  repurchase  agreements  and  Note  7  for  information  regarding  investments  designated  to  the closed  block.  In  addition,  the  Company's  investment  in  FHLB  common  stock,  included  within  other  invested  assets,  which  is considered restricted until redeemed by the issuers, was $769 million and $814 million, at redemption value, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Collectively Significant Equity Method Investments\n\nThe Company holds investments in real estate joint ventures, real estate funds and other limited partnership interests consisting of private equity funds, hedge funds, real estate joint ventures, real estate funds and other funds. The portion of these investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of $23.5 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company's maximum exposure to loss related to these equity method investments is limited to the carrying value of these investments plus unfunded commitments of $7.6 billion at December 31, 2021. Except for certain real estate joint ventures and certain funds, the Company's investments in its remaining real estate funds and other limited partnership interests are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not participate in the management of the entities.\n\nAs described in Note 1, the Company generally recognizes its share of earnings in its equity method investments within net investment income using a three-month lag in instances where the investee's financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee's reporting period differs from the Company's reporting period. Aggregate net investment income from these equity method investments exceeded 10% of the Company's consolidated pre-tax income (loss) for the three most recent annual periods.\n\nThe following aggregated summarized financial data reflects the latest available financial information and does not represent the  Company's  proportionate  share  of  the  assets,  liabilities,  or  earnings  of  such  entities. Aggregate  total  assets  of  these  entities totaled  $1.1  trillion  and  $704.5  billion  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively. Aggregate  total  liabilities  of  these  entities totaled $149.4 billion and $99.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Aggregate net income (loss) of these entities totaled  $231.0  billion,  $41.6  billion  and  $47.0  billion  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively. Aggregate  net  income  (loss)  from  the  underlying  entities  in  which  the  Company  invests  is  primarily  comprised  of  investment income, including recurring investment income and realized and unrealized investment gains (losses).",

Equity  securities and  debt  instruments,  at  fair  value  include  investments  in  funds  that  are measured at NA V of the investment fund. The firm uses NA V to measure the fair value of fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the  NA V of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  the  firm's  investments  in  funds  at  NA V  consist  of investments in firm-sponsored private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm co-invests with third-party investors.\n\nPrivate  equity  funds  primarily  invest  in  a  broad  range  of  industries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments  and  distressed  investments.  Credit  funds  generally  invest  in loans  and  other  fixed  income  instruments  and  are  focused  on  providing private high-yield capital for leveraged and management buyout transactions,  recapitalizations,  financings,  refinancings,  acquisitions  and restructurings  for  private  equity  firms,  private  family  companies  and corporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally, primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and property. Substantially all private equity, credit and real estate funds are closed-end funds  in  which  the  firm's  investments  are  generally  not  eligible  for redemption. Distributions will be received from  these funds as the underlying  assets  are  liquidated  or  distributed,  the  timing  of  which  is uncertain.\n\nThe  firm  also  invests  in  hedge  funds,  primarily  multi-disciplinary  hedge funds  that  employ  a  fundamental  bottom-up  investment  approach  across various  asset  classes  and  strategies.  The  firm's  investments  in  hedge funds primarily include interests where the underlying assets are illiquid in nature,  and  proceeds  from  redemptions  will  not  be  received  until  the underlying  assets  are  liquidated  or  distributed,  the  timing  of  which  is uncertain.\n\nThe  table  below  presents  the  fair  value  of  investments  in  funds  at  NA V and the related unfunded commitments.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\n\n## Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\n\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\n\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our  policyholders  or  contractholders.  Business  conditions,  rating  agency  considerations,  tax ation,  dividend  and  repatriation  rules,  and  monetary  transfer  and  foreign currency exchange rules may limit our insurance subsidiaries' dividends and other payments. We may need to transfer capital among our companies to comply with net worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\n\n## Investment Risks\n\n## We May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\n\nIn case of a major economic downturn, U.S. government default (or threatened default), acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fix ed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default rate of our investment portfolio may increase. These changes could harm the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fix ed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\n\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain when we sell assets, and our results of operations or financial condition. Legislation or regulations that would allow or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans or other investments could harm our investment portfolio.\n\nMajor public health issues have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These may continue to contribute to our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, asset impairments and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\n\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value, due to reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption, or other reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent, or fail to pay it, or demand lease modifications. We may face moratoriums on foreclosures and other enforcement actions, impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.\n\n## We May Have Difficulty Selling Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value\n\nWhen we sell holdings in our investment portfolio, we may not receive the price we seek and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value. We may face unfavorable conditions in privately-placed fixed income securities, private structured credit, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, private equity, and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds. Our investments may suffer reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption or for other reasons. In addition, central banks' efforts to provide market liquidity or otherwise address market conditions may not be successful or sufficient. We may realize losses that harm our financial metrics, which could harm our compliance with our credit requirements and rating agency capital adequacy measures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife's Information Security Program was described as being overseen by the CISO, with reporting to the ERC, Audit Committee, and Board, and aimed to prevent system disruptions through a NIST-based cybersecurity framework. By 2024, the Program had expanded its governance to include cross-functional oversight from Global Technology & Operations, Risk, Compliance, Legal, Privacy, and Internal Audit functions, and introduced continuous monitoring of critical third-party vendors. Additionally, 2024 introduced annual cross-regional incident response exercises involving senior executives and the Board, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. These changes indicate a more integrated and mature approach to mitigating system disruption risks over time.",

Cybersecurity\n\n## Cybersecurity Management &amp; Strategy\n\nWe manage information security risk through, and as part of, MetLife's Information Security Program (the 'Program'), instituted to maintain controls for the systems, applications, and databases of the Company and of its third-party providers. The primary goal of the Program is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all data MetLife owns or possesses, as well as its technology assets, through physical, technical, and administrative safeguards. This includes controls and procedures across business units and at the enterprise level for monitoring, detecting, reporting, containing, managing, and remediating cyber threats. The Program aims to prevent data exfiltration, manipulation, and destruction, as well as system and transactional disruption. The Program's threat-centric and risk-based approach for securing the MetLife environment takes into consideration applicable guidelines from the cybersecurity framework developed by the U.S. G overnment's National Institute of Standards and Technology along with the sensitivity of the systems and the potential severity of the associated risks to MetLife and its relevant lines of business, and is managed by MetLife's CISO, collaborating with lines of business and corporate functions. Our Board of Directors oversees the Program.\n\nThe key features of the Program include:\n\n- A cybersecurity incident response team under the CISO's direction, which is responsible for monitoring and responding to threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.\n- An incident response plan that is managed by the CISO and the Chief Privacy Officer and tested through cross-functional annual exercises in various geographical regions of the Company, many of which include participation from senior executives and the Board of Directors.\n- Information security policies and procedures that are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect applicable changes in law, technology, practice and emerging threats.\n- Regular network and application testing and surveillance.\n- Periodic review of threats, vulnerabilities and other cybersecurity risks, internal and ex ternal.\n- Risk mitigation strategies, including annual internal and third-party risk assessments, as well as cybersecurity and privacy liability insurance intended to defray costs associated with an information security breach.\n- Vendor management procedures designed to identify and address potential risks associated with the use of third-party service providers.\n- Employee training programs on information security, data security, and cybersecurity practices and protection of data against cyber threats, at least annually.\n- A cross-functional approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, with participation from  G lobal  Technology &amp;  Operations,  Risk,  Compliance,  Legal,  Privacy and Internal Audit functions.\n\nWe exercise risk-based due diligence in selecting our third-party service providers, including, as appropriate, review of vendor applications, general IT controls and the IT facilities used to service MetLife's business. Third parties are governed by the MetLife Third-Party Risk Management program, which includes risk assessment prior to onboarding. Based on the assessment of risk, certain third-party service providers must periodically update relevant assessment documentation and be reevaluated by MetLife relative to their internal controls. V endors deemed critical and high risk are continuously monitored by various industry solutions and services designed to identify cybersecurity risks.\n\nWe also work with third parties, such as independent assessors (for example, for industry maturity assessments, penetration testing, application security reviews, and independent audits), external legal counsel and other consultants as part of the design and implementation of the Program. The Program is periodically evaluated by external experts, and the results of those reviews are reported to the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, we have not identified risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect MetLife, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For further discussion of MetLife's risks related to cybersecurity, see 'Risk Factors - Operational Risks - We May Fail to Protect the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of Our Systems or Data, Including As a Result of a Failure in Our Cybersecurity or Other Information Security Systems or Our Disaster Recovery Plans or Those of Our Vendors.'",

By 2024, this methodology remained consistent, with the same reliance on quoted prices or NAV from fund managers for these types of investments. The separate account liabilities in both years were stated to offset the separate account assets, indicating a stable relationship between the two entities.

      "question": "How did AIG's 2022 fair value impairments on commercial mortgage loans impact their 2023 disclosures around CMBS unrealized losses, particularly in terms of the shift in unrealized loss duration buckets for CMBS holdings?",
      "answer": "AIG's 2022 fair value impairments on commercial mortgage loans (which include CMBS collateral) set the stage for their 2023 disclosures showing a significant shift in unrealized loss duration buckets. In 2022, AIG reported $13,348 million in CMBS fair value, with $1,420 million in gross unrealized losses, of which $1,094 million were unrealized losses for less than 12 months and $326 million for 12 months or more. By 2023, the CMBS portfolio had restructured, with $11,056 million in total fair value, but the gross unrealized losses increased to $1,246 million, where $219 million were less than 12 months and $1,027 million were 12 months or more. This indicates that AIG's 2022 impairments on commercial mortgage loans (which directly underpin CMBS) likely contributed to the increased long-duration unrealized losses in 2023, as the unrealized losses that were less than 12 months in 2022 rolled into the 12+ months bucket in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG(2022) \u2192 Commercial Mortgage Loans: AIG recognized impairments on commercial mortgage loans as part of non-recurring fair value measurements in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Commercial Mortgage Loans \u2192 CMBS: Commercial mortgage loans serve as the collateral basis for CMBS, meaning impairments in the underlying loans can affect CMBS valuation.",
        "Hop 3: CMBS \u2190 AIG(2023): In 2023, AIG disclosed CMBS unrealized losses, showing a notable increase in the 12+ months unrealized loss category, reflecting the prior year\u2019s impairments rolling forward."

      "answer": "In 2022, Class B common stock had 245 million shares outstanding with a conversion rate of 1.6059 into Class A common stock, resulting in 394 million as-converted Class A shares. By 2023, while the number of Class B shares remained unchanged at 245 million, the conversion rate increased slightly to 1.6228, leading to 398 million as-converted Class A shares. This reflects a minor increase in the relative voting power of Class B stockholders when converted into Class A shares. Additionally, in 2022, Class A common stockholders held 1,635 million shares, while in 2023, this increased to 1,677 million, showing a growth in the absolute number of Class A shares outstanding. The relationship between the two classes remained governed by the same structural voting rules, with Class B stockholders retaining 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, non-dilutable under the terms of incorporation.",

        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The voting rights structure in 2022 allocated 66\u2154% of voting power to Class A and 33\u2153% to Class B, with Class B shares carrying 15 votes each.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 V(2023): By 2023, the Class B conversion rate increased to 1.6228, and while the number of Class B shares remained the same, their as-converted Class A equivalent rose to 398 million."

      "question": "Given that both SCHW's Capital Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical Capital Buffer remained at 2.5% and 0% respectively in 2023 and 2024, how did the stability in these regulatory buffer requirements reflect on SCHW's risk profile and macroprudential policy environment during this period?",
      "answer": "SCHW maintained the same regulatory capital buffer requirements in both 2023 and 2024, with the Capital Conservation Buffer at 2.5% and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at 0% for both years. This consistency suggests that the macroprudential policy environment, as set by the Federal Reserve, did not impose additional capital buffer requirements on SCHW. The stability in these buffers indicates that regulators did not perceive significant systemic risk buildup or economic overheating during this time, allowing SCHW to maintain its capital distribution policies without restriction. This aligns with the description in the MS document, which notes that the Countercyclical Capital Buffer can be set up to 2.5% but was held at zero, reflecting a neutral stance in the near-term regulatory approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SCHW(2023) \u2192 Capital Conservation Buffer: SCHW's subsidiary CSB was required to maintain a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer in 2023, which restricts capital distributions if not met.",
        "Hop 2: Capital Conservation Buffer \u2192 Countercyclical Capital Buffer: The Countercyclical Capital Buffer is a component of the total capital buffer requirement and can be set up to 2.5%, though it was zero in both years.",
        "Hop 3: Countercyclical Capital Buffer \u2190 SCHW(2024): In 2024, SCHW's subsidiaries remained subject to a 0% Countercyclical Capital Buffer, indicating no change in macroprudential tightening or loosening."

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife identified Commercial Mortgage Loans as a source of credit spread risk, noting that changes in spreads could increase borrowing costs and reduce investment yields (MET_10k_2022.pdf). These loans directly underpin CMBS, which are structured products collateralized by multiple commercial mortgages (MET_10k_2023.pdf). In 2023, MetLife disclosed that its CMBS holdings had a total estimated fair value of $9.949 billion, with $850 million classified as Level 3, indicating significant unobservable inputs and potential sensitivity to credit spread volatility. This suggests that the credit spread risks flagged in 2022 were material to the valuation uncertainty of CMBS in 2023, particularly in the less transparent Level 3 category.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Credit Spread Risks\n\nChanges in credit spreads may result in market price volatility and cash flow variability. Market price volatility can make valuations  of  our  securities  difficult  if  trading  becomes  less  frequent,  which  may  require  us  to  add  to  our  reserves.  Market volatility may cause changes in credit spreads, defaults and a lack of pricing transparency. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income. A sustained decrease in credit spreads could reduce the yield on our future investments.\n\n## Equity Risks\n\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products' revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products' revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\n\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other postretirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps ('TRRs'), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\n\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds' need for cash. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.\n\n## Real Estate Risks\n\nChanges in leasable commercial space supply and demand, pandemics and other public health issues, creditworthiness of tenants  and  partners,  capital  markets  volatility,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  commodity  prices,  farm  incomes,  housing  and commercial property market conditions, and real estate investment supply and demand may adversely impact our investments in commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and real estate and real estate joint ventures.\n\n## Obligor and Counterparty Risks\n\nOur general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting from local economic and political concerns, as well as volatility in specific sectors. Government entities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such governments.\n\nThe  issuers  or  guarantors  of  fixed  income  securities  and  mortgage  loans  we  own  may  default  on  principal  and  interest payments  they  owe  us.  Additionally,  the  change  in  value  of  underlying  collateral  within  asset-backed  securities  ('ABS'), including mortgage-backed securities, may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may reduce the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and increase the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio.\n\nMany  of  our  transactions  with  counterparties  such  as  brokers  and  dealers,  central  clearinghouses,  commercial  banks, investment banks, hedge funds, investment funds, reinsurers and other financial institutions expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize on the collateral held by us in secured transactions or cannot liquidate such collateral at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Furthermore, potential  action  by  governments  and  regulatory  bodies,  such  as  controlling  investment,  nationalization,  conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks' credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. These may cause losses or impairments to the carrying value of our investments.\n\nOur efforts to manage our total exposure to a single counterparty or limited number of counterparties within or among any of our investment, derivative, treasury, and reinsurance relationships, which we adjust from time to time, may not completely or adequately mitigate counterparty risks.",

      "question": "How did MET's increased exposure to real estate funds in 2023, particularly in office and industrial properties, influence its vulnerability to loan portfolio risks in 2024, especially in light of the firm's limited ability to liquidate these investments during periods of market volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MET had $3,659 million invested in real estate funds, which represented 27.4% of its total real estate holdings. These funds primarily invested in real estate companies, loan portfolios, and debt recapitalizations globally. The office and industrial property segments showed growth, with office property values rising from $3,964 million in 2022 to $4,110 million in 2023, and industrial properties increasing from $356 million to $423 million. In 2024, MET's filings highlighted that its loan portfolios, including mortgage loans and private structured credit, were particularly vulnerable to market volatility, with risks of default, reduced liquidity, and impairment. Given that the real estate funds in which MET invested were closed-end and not eligible for redemption, the company faced challenges in liquidating these investments during periods of market stress. This lack of liquidity, combined with the increased exposure to real estate funds in 2023, heightened MET's vulnerability to loan portfolio risks in 2024, especially if borrowers defaulted or if the company needed to raise capital quickly.",

Equity  securities and  debt  instruments,  at  fair  value  include  investments  in  funds  that  are measured at NA V of the investment fund. The firm uses NA V to measure the fair value of fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the  NA V of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  the  firm's  investments  in  funds  at  NA V  consist  of investments in firm-sponsored private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm co-invests with third-party investors.\n\nPrivate  equity  funds  primarily  invest  in  a  broad  range  of  industries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments  and  distressed  investments.  Credit  funds  generally  invest  in loans  and  other  fixed  income  instruments  and  are  focused  on  providing private high-yield capital for leveraged and management buyout transactions,  recapitalizations,  financings,  refinancings,  acquisitions  and restructurings  for  private  equity  firms,  private  family  companies  and corporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally, primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and property. Substantially all private equity, credit and real estate funds are closed-end funds  in  which  the  firm's  investments  are  generally  not  eligible  for redemption. Distributions will be received from  these funds as the underlying  assets  are  liquidated  or  distributed,  the  timing  of  which  is uncertain.\n\nThe  firm  also  invests  in  hedge  funds,  primarily  multi-disciplinary  hedge funds  that  employ  a  fundamental  bottom-up  investment  approach  across various  asset  classes  and  strategies.  The  firm's  investments  in  hedge funds primarily include interests where the underlying assets are illiquid in nature,  and  proceeds  from  redemptions  will  not  be  received  until  the underlying  assets  are  liquidated  or  distributed,  the  timing  of  which  is uncertain.\n\nThe  table  below  presents  the  fair  value  of  investments  in  funds  at  NA V and the related unfunded commitments.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\n\n## Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\n\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\n\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our  policyholders  or  contractholders.  Business  conditions,  rating  agency  considerations,  tax ation,  dividend  and  repatriation  rules,  and  monetary  transfer  and  foreign currency exchange rules may limit our insurance subsidiaries' dividends and other payments. We may need to transfer capital among our companies to comply with net worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\n\n## Investment Risks\n\n## We May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\n\nIn case of a major economic downturn, U.S. government default (or threatened default), acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fix ed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default rate of our investment portfolio may increase. These changes could harm the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fix ed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\n\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain when we sell assets, and our results of operations or financial condition. Legislation or regulations that would allow or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans or other investments could harm our investment portfolio.\n\nMajor public health issues have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These may continue to contribute to our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, asset impairments and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\n\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value, due to reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption, or other reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent, or fail to pay it, or demand lease modifications. We may face moratoriums on foreclosures and other enforcement actions, impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.\n\n## We May Have Difficulty Selling Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value\n\nWhen we sell holdings in our investment portfolio, we may not receive the price we seek and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value. We may face unfavorable conditions in privately-placed fixed income securities, private structured credit, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, private equity, and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds. Our investments may suffer reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption or for other reasons. In addition, central banks' efforts to provide market liquidity or otherwise address market conditions may not be successful or sufficient. We may realize losses that harm our financial metrics, which could harm our compliance with our credit requirements and rating agency capital adequacy measures.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MET disclosed a $522 million impact from a 10% decrease in equity prices linked to their equity market derivatives, indicating a strong sensitivity to equity market risk. By 2024, MET actively used equity index options and futures to hedge against this risk, particularly to offset exposure from minimum guarantees in variable annuity products. The shift from a passive sensitivity to an active hedging strategy reflects a deliberate evolution in MET's approach to managing equity market risk.",

Derivatives (continued)\n\nTo  a  lesser  ex tent,  the  Company  uses  ex change-traded  currency  futures  to  hedge  currency  mismatches  between  assets  and  liabilities,  and  to  hedge  minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded currency futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\n## Credit Derivatives\n\nThe Company enters into purchased credit default swaps to hedge against credit-related changes in the value of its investments. In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a premium to hedge credit risk. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. Credit events vary by type of issuer but typically include bankruptcy, failure  to  pay  debt  obligations  and  involuntary  restructuring  for  corporate  obligors,  as  well  as  repudiation,  moratorium  or  governmental  intervention  for  sovereign obligors. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the relevant third party, Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee determines that a credit event has occurred. The Company utilizes credit default swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nThe Company enters into written credit default swaps to synthetically create credit investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and one or more cash instruments, such as U.S. government and agency, or other fixed maturity securities AFS. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nThe Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the Company designates these transactions as credit forwards. The Company utilizes credit forwards in cash flow hedging relationships.\n\n## Equity Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses a variety of equity derivatives to reduce its exposure to equity market risk, including equity index options, equity variance swaps, exchangetraded equity futures and equity total return swaps.\n\nEquity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. To hedge against changes in equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the underlying equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of ex ercise and the strike price. Certain of these contracts may also contain settlement provisions linked to interest rates. In certain instances, the Company may enter into a combination of transactions to hedge changes in equity indices within a pre-determined range through the purchase and sale of options. The Company utilizes equity index options in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nEquity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future, based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nIn exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of equity securities, to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts and to pledge initial margin based on futures exchange requirements. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded equity futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships.",

      "question": "How did the changes in Visa's Class A Common Stock conversion dynamics in 2023 influence the voting rights structure of Series C Preferred Stock in 2024, particularly in light of the increased issuance of Class C Common Stock following the May 2024 exchange offer?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Visa disclosed that Class B-1 Common Stock could be converted into Class A Common Stock or exchanged for Class C Common Stock and Class B-2 Common Stock under specific conditions tied to litigation resolutions and conversion rate adjustments. The May 2024 exchange offer resulted in the issuance of 48 million shares of Class C Common Stock, which, unlike Class B stock, had no transfer restrictions. This shift affected the voting rights structure in 2024, as Class C Common Stock, like Class B, had no voting rights except for specific defined matters. Meanwhile, Series C Preferred Stock holders had no voting rights except for limited corporate events, and their influence could only be indirectly affected by changes in the Class A Common Stock base\u2014into which they could convert\u2014due to the evolving conversion rates tied to litigation outcomes and stock issuance dynamics. Thus, the increased issuance of Class C Common Stock diluted the relative influence of voting stockholders, indirectly shaping the strategic positioning of Series C Preferred Stock holders in corporate governance matters.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported $1,623 in Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) and $3,639 in Future Policy Benefits for the EMEA region, indicating significant exposure tied to life insurance products. The EMEA segment explicitly offered life insurance to individuals and corporations, as stated in the 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, MetLife continued to produce traditional and non-traditional life insurance products globally, including whole and term life, endowments, and variable life products, with group term life programs available in most markets. This suggests continuity in life insurance offerings, though the financial metrics from EMEA in 2022 highlight a specific regional exposure that may influence the strategic positioning of life insurance products in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife introduced pricing strategies for annuity products that included adjustments based on mortality, longevity, and investment return assumptions, with periodic reevaluations of guarantee features (MET_10k_2022.pdf:page_15:chunk_1). These pricing strategies were linked to pension risk transfers, which are a key component of MetLife\u2019s RIS annuity business and are priced based on similar actuarial assumptions (MET_10k_2023.pdf:page_179:chunk_1). By 2023, this pricing framework contributed to an increase in the estimated cash flows for pension risk transfers, with total obligations reaching $310.4 billion, significantly exceeding the recorded liability of $219.7 billion, partly due to updated mortality assumptions and the time value of money (MET_10k_2023.pdf:page_113:chunk_1). This indicates that the 2022 pricing decisions had a measurable impact on the growth and liability structure of pension risk transfers in 2023.",

Our reinsurers generally have the right to audit our underwriting.\n\nWe use underwriting policies,  guidelines,  philosophies,  and  strategies  that  we  intend  to  be  competitive  and  suitable  for  the customer, the agent and us, to facilitate quality sales, and to serve our customers' needs while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. We aim to ensure that underwriting risk levels are appropriately reflected in our product pricing.\n\nWe continually review our underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies in light of applicable regulations and to  ensure  that  our  policies  remain  competitive,  support  our  marketing  strategies  and  profitability  goals,  and  otherwise  remain appropriate.\n\n## Pricing\n\nProduct pricing reflects our globally-consistent standards. Global Risk Management and regional finance and product teams price and oversee all of our insurance businesses. We base our pricing on the expected benefits payout which we calculate through the use of assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns and macroeconomic factors such as inflation. We price investment-oriented products based on factors such as investment returns, expenses, persistency, optionality, and possible variability of results.\n\nOur  pricing  of  certain  products  may  include  prospective  and  retrospective  experience  rating  features.  For  prospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses. For retrospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine our cost of providing insurance for the customer in light of any  features  that  allow  us  to  recoup  certain  losses  or  distribute  certain  gains  back  to  the  policyholder  based  on  prior  years' experience.\n\nWe base our rates for group benefit products on anticipated earnings and expenses for the book of business. We generally reevaluate renewals annually or biannually and re-price products to reflect our experience on such products.\n\nWe generally price many of our RIS products on demand. Our pricing reflects our expected investment returns, as well as mortality, longevity and expense assumptions. RIS business is generally nonparticipating and illiquid, as policyholders have few or no options or contractual rights to cash values. However, for products with liquidity provisions, such as stable value, pricing reflects the contractholders' ability to withdraw at book value over a period of time, as well as our ability to reset rates periodically.\n\nWe generally must receive regulatory approval of rates for individual life insurance products. Such rates are highly regulated, even where we are not required to obtain advance regulatory approval. We generally renew such products annually, and they may include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain period of time.\n\nWe price individual disability income products based on anticipated results by occupation.\n\nOur  rates  for  fixed  and  variable  annuity  products  are  also  highly  regulated,  and  we  also  generally  must  receive  regulatory approval  of  them.  Such  products  generally  include  penalties  for  early  withdrawals  and  policyholder  benefit  elections  to  tailor benefits to policyholder needs. We periodically reevaluate the costs of such options and adjust pricing levels on our guarantees. We may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features we offer.\n\nWe  continually  review  our  pricing  guidelines  in  light  of  applicable  regulations  and  to  ensure  that  our  policies  remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate.\n\n## Reinsurance Activity\n\nWe enter  into  reinsurance  agreements  primarily  as  a  purchaser  of  reinsurance  for  our  various  insurance  products.  We  also provide  reinsurance  for  some  third  parties'  insurance  products.  We  participate  in  reinsurance  in  order  to  limit  losses,  minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. Our reinsurance covers individual risks, group risks, or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess, or catastrophe excess basis. The extent of our retained risks depends on our risk evaluation, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on our risk appetite.  We  also  cede  first  dollar  mortality  risk  under  certain  contracts.  We  reinsure  both  mortality  and  other  risks.  We  obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes and when its economic impact makes it appropriate to do so.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that its fixed maturity securities AFS by sector included RMBS (agency, prime, alternative, and sub-prime), ABS, and CMBS, collectively categorized as 'Structured Products.' These were evaluated quarterly for ACL and impairments based on subjective risk assessments tied to credit, interest rate, and market valuation risks. The MMM_10k_2022.pdf further clarifies that fixed income investments, including mortgage-backed securities, were valued using NAV per share as a practical expedient, indicating a reliance on fair value methodologies tied to underlying assets. By 2024, MetLife emphasized a more disciplined asset-liability management (ALM) approach, focusing on cash flow timing and duration matching with liabilities, while maintaining a heavy weighting toward fixed income investments like mortgage-backed securities. The shift from a risk-focused disclosure in 2022 to a strategy of optimizing risk-adjusted investment income and total return in 2024 suggests a more structured and strategic allocation to MBS, aligned with liability cash outflows and improved duration management.",

Investments\n\nSee Note 10 for information about the fair value hierarchy for investments and the related valuation methodologies.\n\n## Investment Risks and Uncertainties\n\nInvestments are exposed to the following primary sources of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity, market valuation, currency and real estate risk. The financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks, are those associated with the determination of estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions, the recognition of ACL  and  impairments,  the  recognition  of  income  on  certain  investments  and  the  potential  consolidation  of  VIEs.  The  use  of different  methodologies,  assumptions  and  inputs  relating  to  these  financial  statement  risks  may  have  a  material  effect  on  the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe determination of ACL and impairments is highly subjective and is based upon quarterly evaluations and assessments of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\n\nThe  recognition  of  income  on  certain  investments  (e.g.  structured  securities,  including  mortgage-backed  securities,  assetbacked securities ('ABS'), certain structured investment transactions and FVO Securities) is dependent upon certain factors such as prepayments and defaults, and changes in such factors could result in changes in amounts to be earned.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS by Sector\n\nThe following table presents fixed maturity securities AFS by sector. U.S. corporate and foreign corporate sectors include redeemable preferred stock. RMBS includes agency, prime, alternative and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. ABS includes securities collateralized by corporate loans and consumer loans. Municipals includes taxable and tax-exempt revenue bonds and, to  a  much  lesser  extent,  general  obligations  of  states,  municipalities  and  political  subdivisions.  Commercial  mortgage-backed securities  ('CMBS')  primarily  includes  securities  collateralized  by  multiple  commercial  mortgage  loans.

      "answer": "AIG experienced $210M of unfavorable prior-year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines in 2021, primarily due to large loss activity in Financial PI in the UK and Commercial D&O in Europe.

          "chunk_text": "## Reserving Process and Methodology\n\nU.S. Personal Insurance consists of accident and health and personal lines. Accident and health products include voluntary and sponsor-paid personal accident and supplemental health products for individuals, employees, associations and other organizations as well as a broad range of travel insurance products and services for leisure and business travelers. Personal lines include automobile and homeowners' insurance, extended warranty, and consumer specialty products, such as identity theft and credit card protection. Personal lines also provides insurance for high net worth individuals offered through AIG Private Client Group, including auto, homeowners, umbrella, yacht, fine art and collections insurance. Personal lines are generally short-tail in nature and can reflect significant salvage and subrogation recoveries.\n\nWe primarily segment our analysis by line of business and may separately review various sub-segments, such as specific accident and health products and property damage versus liability for personal lines products.\n\nFrequency/severity methods, loss development methods, and IBNR factor methods are used alone or in combination to set reserves for short-tail product lines such as personal property.\n\nFrequency/severity and loss development methods are utilized for domestic personal auto product lines.\n\nFor these classes of business, reliance is placed on frequency/severity methods as claim counts emerge quickly for personal auto. Frequency/severity methods allow for more immediate analysis of resulting loss trends and comparisons to industry and other diagnostic metrics. Recent COVID-19 related events have caused disruption in claims frequency and severity as well as reporting patterns. Where appropriate, and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques.\n\n## UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $210 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by recognition of large loss activity in Financial PI in the UK and Commercial D&amp;O in Europe.\n\nDuring 2020, we recognized $258 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by Financial Lines in the UK and Europe and Excess Casualty in Europe as we continue to see increased severity of large losses in these classes.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized $161 million of unfavorable prior year development in UK and Europe Casualty and Financial Lines driven by increased large loss activity in recent accident years, particularly related to UK directors and officers class action suits against insureds with global exposure, and increased frequency and severity in European casualty for auto liability and employers liability. This was slightly offset by a benefit from an increase in the Ogden rates in the UK used to value long duration claims.\n\n274 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife introduced new pricing strategies for annuity products, incorporating both prospective and retrospective experience rating features, which required regulatory approval and aimed to reflect investment returns, mortality assumptions, and expense factors. This pricing framework was extended to institutional income annuities, a subset of the RIS segment, which saw growth in 2023 despite an overall decline in adjusted premiums. Specifically, institutional income annuities were called out as a contributor to offsetting the $4.1 billion (7%) decline in adjusted premiums, showing that the 2022 pricing strategies had a positive downstream effect on this product line in 2023.",

Our reinsurers generally have the right to audit our underwriting.\n\nWe use underwriting policies,  guidelines,  philosophies,  and  strategies  that  we  intend  to  be  competitive  and  suitable  for  the customer, the agent and us, to facilitate quality sales, and to serve our customers' needs while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. We aim to ensure that underwriting risk levels are appropriately reflected in our product pricing.\n\nWe continually review our underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies in light of applicable regulations and to  ensure  that  our  policies  remain  competitive,  support  our  marketing  strategies  and  profitability  goals,  and  otherwise  remain appropriate.\n\n## Pricing\n\nProduct pricing reflects our globally-consistent standards. Global Risk Management and regional finance and product teams price and oversee all of our insurance businesses. We base our pricing on the expected benefits payout which we calculate through the use of assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns and macroeconomic factors such as inflation. We price investment-oriented products based on factors such as investment returns, expenses, persistency, optionality, and possible variability of results.\n\nOur  pricing  of  certain  products  may  include  prospective  and  retrospective  experience  rating  features.  For  prospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses. For retrospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine our cost of providing insurance for the customer in light of any  features  that  allow  us  to  recoup  certain  losses  or  distribute  certain  gains  back  to  the  policyholder  based  on  prior  years' experience.\n\nWe base our rates for group benefit products on anticipated earnings and expenses for the book of business. We generally reevaluate renewals annually or biannually and re-price products to reflect our experience on such products.\n\nWe generally price many of our RIS products on demand. Our pricing reflects our expected investment returns, as well as mortality, longevity and expense assumptions. RIS business is generally nonparticipating and illiquid, as policyholders have few or no options or contractual rights to cash values. However, for products with liquidity provisions, such as stable value, pricing reflects the contractholders' ability to withdraw at book value over a period of time, as well as our ability to reset rates periodically.\n\nWe generally must receive regulatory approval of rates for individual life insurance products. Such rates are highly regulated, even where we are not required to obtain advance regulatory approval. We generally renew such products annually, and they may include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain period of time.\n\nWe price individual disability income products based on anticipated results by occupation.\n\nOur  rates  for  fixed  and  variable  annuity  products  are  also  highly  regulated,  and  we  also  generally  must  receive  regulatory approval  of  them.  Such  products  generally  include  penalties  for  early  withdrawals  and  policyholder  benefit  elections  to  tailor benefits to policyholder needs. We periodically reevaluate the costs of such options and adjust pricing levels on our guarantees. We may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features we offer.\n\nWe  continually  review  our  pricing  guidelines  in  light  of  applicable  regulations  and  to  ensure  that  our  policies  remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate.\n\n## Reinsurance Activity\n\nWe enter  into  reinsurance  agreements  primarily  as  a  purchaser  of  reinsurance  for  our  various  insurance  products.  We  also provide  reinsurance  for  some  third  parties'  insurance  products.  We  participate  in  reinsurance  in  order  to  limit  losses,  minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. Our reinsurance covers individual risks, group risks, or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess, or catastrophe excess basis. The extent of our retained risks depends on our risk evaluation, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on our risk appetite.  We  also  cede  first  dollar  mortality  risk  under  certain  contracts.  We  reinsure  both  mortality  and  other  risks.  We  obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes and when its economic impact makes it appropriate to do so.",

If either buffer falls below the minimum requirement, the Company would be subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

Institutions are assigned one of four ratings ('outstanding,' 'satisfactory,' 'needs to improve,' or 'substantial noncompliance'). The failure of an institution to receive at least a 'satisfactory' rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions or opening branch offices.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve's long-held position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions, the so-called 'source of strength doctrine.' In effect, the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress.\n\n## Volcker Rule\n\nCSC and its subsidiaries are subject to the Volcker Rule, which generally prohibits proprietary trading or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to certain exemptions, in each case as the applicable terms are defined in the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations.\n\n## Broker-Dealer, FCM, FDM, and Investment Advisor Regulation\n\nOur principal broker-dealer subsidiaries, CS&amp;Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, are each registered as a broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission), the fifty states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. CS&amp;Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., CSIM, and certain of our other subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Charles Schwab Futures and Forex LLC (CSFF, formerly known as TD Ameritrade Futures &amp; Forex LLC) is registered as an FCM and FDM with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nMuch of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to SROs. Our principal broker-dealers are each members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). In addition, CS&amp;Co is a member of Nasdaq Stock Market, Cboe EDGX and MEMX, and TDAC is a member of NYSE Arca, Nasdaq Stock Market, Cboe EDGX and MEMX. In addition to the SEC, the primary regulators of our principal broker-dealers are FINRA and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The National Futures Association (NFA) is the primary regulator for CSFF's futures, commodities, and forex trading activities.\n\nThe principal purpose of regulating these entities is the protection of clients and securities markets. The regulations cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients' funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties, and the conduct of directors, officers, and employees.\n\nOur principal broker-dealer entities are subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer and it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule.\n\nThe Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits broker-dealers from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances or loans or repaying subordinated loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.\n\nIn addition to net capital requirements, as a self-clearing broker-dealer, CS&amp;Co, and as a clearing broker-dealer, TDAC, are subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses, such as the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation, which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients' trading activity and market volatility.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of BAC's use of ECL models in 2023, which relied on contractual terms to forecast principal cash flows, influence their treatment of contractual terms in 2024 for estimating credit losses on commercial loans and unfunded commitments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BAC used ECL models that relied heavily on contractual terms to forecast principal cash flows for commercial loans, including expected prepayments and borrower behavior for open-ended commitments. This modeling approach was further grounded in contractual life and borrower-specific attributes. By 2024, BAC continued to use contractual terms as a foundation but expanded their application to include more nuanced borrower-specific factors such as delinquency status, credit scores, and collateral values, particularly for unfunded commitments like revolving lines of credit. The 2024 models also incorporated broader economic indicators like unemployment rates and GDP forecasts, indicating a more integrated and dynamic use of contractual terms within the ECL estimation process. This shows a clear evolution from a primarily structure-based modeling approach in 2023 to a more behaviorally and economically sensitive framework in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies  consumer  loans  as  nonperforming  at 90  days  past  due  and  reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.\n\nThe  Corporation  has  identified  the  following three  portfolio  segments  and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nTo  estimate  ECL  for  consumer  loans  secured  by  residential  real  estate,  the Corporation  estimates  the  number  of  loans  that  will  default  over  the  life  of  th e existing  portfolio,  after  factoring  in  estimated  prepayments,  using  quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation's  ECL  include  refreshed  loan-to-value  (L TV)  or,  in  the  case  of  a subordinated lien, refreshed combined L TV (CL TV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography , all of which are further broken down by present collection  status  (whether  the  loan  is  current,  delinquent,  in  default,  or  in bankruptcy).  The  estimates  are  based  on  the  Corporation's  historical  experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses  on  the  unpaid  principal  balance  of  loans  insured  by  th e  Fed eral  Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation's HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies  noted  above  and  incorporate  utilization  assumptions  at  time  of default.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than 180  days  past  due,  the  Corporation  bases  the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date  less  costs  to  sell.  Th e  fair  value  of  th e  collateral  securing  th ese  loans  is generally determined using an automated valuation model (A VM) that estimates the value  of  a  property  by  reference  to  market  data  including  sales  of  comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an A VM value is not available, the Corporation  utilizes  publicized  indices  or  if  th ese  meth od s  provid e  less  reliab le valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the  Corporation  believes  that  they  are  representative  of  this  portfolio  in  the aggregate.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than 180  days  past  due,  with  the  exception  of  the Corporation's  fully  insured  portfolio,  th e  outstanding  balance  of  loans  th at  is  in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If th e estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance  to  account  for  the  increase  but  not  to  a  level  above  th e  cumulative charge-off amount.\n\n## Credit Cards and Other Consumer\n\nCredit  cards  are  revolving  lines  of  credit  with out  a  d efined   maturity  d ate.  Th e estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and  timing  of  expected  future  payments  (e.g.,  borrowers  making  full  payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that  it  will  take  for  a  receivable balance  to  pay  off.  Th e  ECL  on  th e  future  payments  incorporates  th e  spending behavior  of  a  b orrower  th rough   time  using  key  b orrower-specific  factors  and   th e economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. F uture draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n\nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is  also  determined  using quantitative  methods  supplemented  with  qualitative  analysis.  The  quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, L TV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  ECL  on  commercial  loans  is  forecasted  using  models  that  estimate  credit losses over the loan's contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual  terms  to  forecast  future  principal  cash  flows  while  also  considering expected  prepayments.  For  open-ended  commitments  such  as  revolving  lines  of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and  payment  behavior  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  commitment.  For  loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer  attributes  such  as  L TV  ratio,  net  operating  income  and  debt  service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the  loss  forecasting  model  determines  the  probabilities  of  transition  to  different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions  of expected loss are conditioned  to  the  economic  outlook,  and  the  model  considers  key  economic variables  such  as  unemployment  rate,  gross  domestic  product,  corporate  bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n\nIn  addition  to  th e  allowance  for  loan  and   lease  losses,  th e  Corporation  also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves  are  estimated  for  the  unfunded  exposure  using  the  same  models  and methodologies as the funded exposure",

This change in benchmark rate, which required South Carolina regulatory approval, influenced MET's interest expense, which rose from $22 million in 2022 to $44 million in 2023. MET responded by adjusting its senior note issuance strategy, issuing $2 billion in new long-term senior notes in 2023 (July 2023: $1.0 billion at 5.375%, January 2023: $1.0 billion at 5.250%), while redeeming $1.0 billion of shorter-term senior notes due in 2023.

In connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors placed by an unaffiliated financial institution, $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 35-year surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes accrues at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.55%, payable quarterly. The ability of MRC to make interest and principal payments on the surplus notes is contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval.\n\nSimultaneously with the issuance of the surplus notes, MetLife, Inc. entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated financial institution,  under  which  MetLife,  Inc.  is  entitled  to  the  interest  paid  by  MRC  on  the  surplus  notes  of  three-month  LIBOR  plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of three-month LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted, as described below. MetLife, Inc. may also be required to pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related to any decline in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes. Any such payments are accounted for as a receivable and included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and do not reduce the principal amount outstanding of the surplus notes. Such  payments,  however,  reduce  the  amount  of  interest  payments  due  from  MetLife,  Inc.  under  the  agreement. Any  payment received from the unaffiliated financial institution reduces the receivable by an amount equal to such payment and also increases the amount of interest payments due from MetLife, Inc. under the agreement. In addition, the unaffiliated financial institution may be required to pledge collateral to MetLife, Inc. related to any increase in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  following  regulatory  approval,  MRC  repurchased  $79  million, $148 million and $67 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the surplus notes. Payments made by the Company in 2021, 2020 and 2019 associated with the repurchases were exclusive of accrued interest on the surplus notes. In connection with the repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company received payments in the aggregate amount of $10  million,  $20  million  and  $9  million,  respectively,  from  the  unaffiliated  financial  institution,  which  reduced  the  amount receivable from the unaffiliated financial institution by the same amounts. No other payments related to an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes were made by MetLife, Inc. or received from the unaffiliated financial institution for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\nA majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus notes was placed in a trust, which is consolidated by the Company, to support MRC's statutory obligations associated with the assumed closed block liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, MRC transferred $78 million and $2 million, respectively, to the trust out of its general account. For the year ended December 31, 2020, MRC transferred $78 million out of the trust to its general account. The assets are principally invested in fixed maturity  securities AFS  and  are  presented  as  such  within  the  Company's  consolidated  balance  sheets,  with  the  related  income included within net investment income on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.",

      "question": "How did the adoption of LDTI in 2023 impact MET's accounting for embedded derivatives tied to equity-indexed annuities, and how did this affect the presentation of annuity liabilities in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MET adopted the LDTI accounting standard, which changed the measurement model for embedded derivatives, causing most of them to meet the criteria to be accounted for as Market Risk Benefits (MRBs), leading to their exclusion from critical accounting estimates. These embedded derivatives were specifically tied to equity-indexed annuities, as noted in the 2023 disclosures. By 2024, the annuity liabilities continued to include embedded derivatives related to equity-indexed annuities, indicating that while the accounting treatment evolved post-LDTI adoption, the structural relationship between these products and derivatives remained intact. This reflects a transformation in how MET reported and managed these liabilities across the two years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET(2023) \u2192 Embedded Derivatives: MET adopted LDTI in 2023, which changed how embedded derivatives were accounted for, with most now classified as MRBs and no longer considered critical accounting estimates.",
        "Hop 2: Embedded Derivatives \u2192 Equity-Indexed Annuities: MET explicitly stated in 2023 that embedded derivatives were related to equity-indexed annuities and were included in annuity policyholder account balances.",
        "Hop 3: Equity-Indexed Annuities \u2190 MET(2024): In 2024, MET continued to report that its annuity liabilities included embedded derivatives related to equity-indexed annuities, showing continuity in product structure despite accounting changes."

Despite this reduction, the RMBS portfolio remained diversified across security types and risk profiles. The proportion of non-agency RMBS within the portfolio increased slightly from 36.5% in 2023 to 37.7% in 2024, suggesting a potential shift toward higher-risk assets within the RMBS category even as overall exposure to pass-through securities declined.",

Our investment selection criteria and monitoring include review of credit ratings, characteristics of the assets underlying the securities, borrower characteristics and the level of credit enhancement. We held $63.7 billion and $56.3 billion of Structured Products at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS sections below.\n\n## RMBS\n\nOur RMBS portfolio is broadly diversified by security type and risk profile.\n\nOn a security type basis, RMBS includes collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\n\nOn a risk profile basis, RMBS includes Agency and Non-Agency securities. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association,  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  or  G overnment  National  Mortgage  Association.  Non-Agency  securities  include  prime,  prime investor,  non-qualified  residential  mortgage  ('NQM'),  and  alternative  residential  mortgage  loans  ('Alt-A'),  and  reperforming  and  sub-prime  mortgage-backed securities. Prime (owner-occupied) and prime investor (non-owner-occupied) loans were originated to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. NQM and Alt-A are classifications of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime.  Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles, while reperforming loans were previously delinquent that returned to performing status.",

      "question": "How did the adoption of ASU 2022-02 in 2023 impact PYPL's loan modification disclosures, and how does this relate to PYPL's regulatory obligations under evolving disclosure requirements in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PYPL adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the troubled debt restructuring (TDR) designation and introduced new disclosure requirements for loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This resulted in PYPL disclosing gross charge-offs by year of origination and providing more detailed information on financial difficulty modifications (FDMs), including types of modifications such as interest rate reductions, term extensions, and principal forgiveness. By 2024, PYPL was subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and evolving disclosure obligations globally, particularly in the EU and U.K., where it operates under credit institution and electronic money institution frameworks. These evolving disclosure requirements demanded greater transparency and specificity in reporting loan modifications and credit risk, aligning with the enhanced disclosures introduced by ASU 2022-02. Thus, PYPL's 2023 adoption of ASU 2022-02 positioned it to better meet the more stringent disclosure expectations in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\n\nGovernment regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.\n\nPayments regulation. Various  laws  and  regulations  govern  the  payments  industry  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally.  In  the  U.S.,  PayPal,  Inc.  (a  wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only our PayPal-branded products and services, but also our V enmo, Hyperwallet, Xoom, and Zettle products and services, to the ex tent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions on the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal's service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or V enmo account. In the State of New Y ork, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state.\n\nOutside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those nonU.S.  entities  are,  or  may  be,  supervised  by  a  financial  regulatory  authority  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  they  operate. Among  other  regulatory  authorities,  the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF'), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People's Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not ex haustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.\n\nIn  addition,  financial  services  regulators  in  various  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.S.  and  the  European  Union  ('EU'),  have  implemented  payment  authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products.\n\nFinancial Services supervision . We serve our customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. ('PayPal (Europe)'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Lux embourg by the CSSF. We serve our customers in the U.K. through PayPal U.K. Limited ('PayPal U.K.'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution in the U.K. by the FCA. Accordingly, we must comply with rules and regulations applicable to electronic money institutions in the U.K. and credit institutions in the E.U., including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate  governance,  anti-money  laundering,  consumer  rights,  disclosure,  reporting,  and  inspection.  We  are,  or  may  be,  subject  to  financial  services-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial services industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and ex amination by the regulators of these partner financial institutions.\n\nLending regulation .  Our  U.S.  consumer  short-term,  interest-free,  installment  product  is  subject  to  federal  and  state  laws  governing  consumer  credit  and  debt collection, and PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender for this product. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation, but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal's consumer short-term, interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, G ermany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity.  Paidy,  Inc.  holds  multiple  licenses  for  the  issuance  of  its  consumer  installment  products  in  Japan  and  is  registered  with  the  Ministry  of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary.\n\n10",

      "question": "How did the composition and diversification strategy of MetLife's RMBS portfolio in 2022 relate to their continued investment in Collateralized Mortgage Obligations in 2024, particularly in light of the $63.7 billion in Structured Products held at year-end 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife emphasized a diversified RMBS portfolio by security type and risk profile, which included both Agency and Non-Agency securities. By 2024, the company continued to invest in Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), a subset of RMBS, as part of a broader $63.7 billion Structured Products portfolio. The persistence of CMOs in the RMBS composition, as detailed in the 2024 filing, indicates that the diversification strategy initiated in 2022 remained a core component of MetLife\u2019s fixed-income investment approach, with CMOs serving as a key instrument for managing cash flow risk and credit exposure within the structured products framework.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Structured Products\n\nOur investments in Structured Products are collateralized by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, bank loans and other assets. Our investment selection criteria and monitoring include review of credit ratings, characteristics of the assets underlying the securities, borrower characteristics and the level of credit enhancement. We held $63.7 billion and $56.3 billion of Structured Products at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS sections below.\n\n## RMBS\n\nOur RMBS portfolio is broadly diversified by security type and risk profile.\n\nOn a security type basis, RMBS includes collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\n\nOn a risk profile basis, RMBS includes Agency and Non-Agency securities. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association,  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  or  G overnment  National  Mortgage  Association.  Non-Agency  securities  include  prime,  prime investor,  non-qualified  residential  mortgage  ('NQM'),  and  alternative  residential  mortgage  loans  ('Alt-A'),  and  reperforming  and  sub-prime  mortgage-backed securities. Prime (owner-occupied) and prime investor (non-owner-occupied) loans were originated to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. NQM and Alt-A are classifications of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime.  Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles, while reperforming loans were previously delinquent that returned to performing status.",

      "question": "How did the composition and application of JPM's capital buffer requirements change between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of the relationship between the Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer?",
      "answer": "In 2023, JPM's capital buffer requirements under the Basel III Standardized approach included a 2.9% Stress Capital Buffer (SCB), a 4.0% GSIB surcharge, and a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, while the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) was set at 0%. By 2024, the regulatory framework still allowed for a discretionary CCyB of up to 2.5%, though it remained at 0%. The capital buffer requirement computed under the Advanced Approach was equal to the sum of the Capital Conservation Buffer (2.5%), GSIB surcharge, and CCyB, indicating that while the structure of the buffer components remained consistent, the emphasis on the macro financial environment increased in 2024, with ongoing annual reviews of the CCyB. This evolution shows a stable buffer structure with increased regulatory focus on macroeconomic conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JPM(2023) \u2192 Capital Conservation Buffer: JPM was subject to a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer applicable to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with a 2.9% SCB under the Standardized approach.",

        "Hop 3: Countercyclical Capital Buffer \u2190 JPM(2024): In 2024, the CCyB remained at 0%, but the regulatory framework emphasized the discretionary nature of the buffer based on macro financial conditions, with potential increases up to 2.5%."

      "answer": "In 2023, American Express National Bank was subject to a static 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as part of its Basel III compliance, which formed part of the broader capital buffer requirement that also included the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB). By 2024, while the CCyB remained at zero percent, the regulatory framework introduced a potential dynamic component through the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, which could be increased up to 2.5% based on macroeconomic conditions. This shift reflects a regulatory evolution where AXP, as a Category III firm, could face an additional buffer requirement on top of its existing 2.5% SCB and 2.5% CCB, signaling a move toward more responsive capital adequacy oversight. The connection between the Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer is that both are components of the overall capital buffer requirement, with the latter offering a discretionary mechanism for regulators to adjust capital requirements in response to economic cycles.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nUnder the Capital Rules, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1 capital), Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. We report our capital adequacy ratios using riskweighted assets calculated under the standardized approach. Category III firms such as the Company are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements, whereas Category II firms are subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements under current capital rules, which introduce additional complexities in the methodologies used to calculate risk-weighted assets for purposes of determining capital adequacy ratios.\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would significantly revise U.S. regulatory capital requirements for large banking organizations, including the Company and AENB. The proposed rules would apply a new expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-based capital ratios, and large banking organizations would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both (i) the standardized approach and (ii) the expanded risk-based approach and use the lower of the two ratio calculations to determine binding capital constraints under each risk-based capital ratio. The expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-weighted assets would apply more granular risk-weighting methodologies for credit risk, include a new standardized methodology for operational risk, include new approaches for calculating market and credit valuation adjustment risk and revise the treatment of equity exposures not subject to market risk capital requirements. The new approach to calculating market risk also would apply to calculations under the standardized approach. The methodology for operational risk would include differential treatment of fee and other non-interest revenues as compared to interest income for purposes of determining operational risk-weighted assets. The proposed rules would also include additional credit risk capital requirements for certain 'unconditionally cancellable commitments' such as unused portions of committed lines of credit (e.g., credit cards) and would create a proxy methodology to assign capital requirements to credit exposure on products that carry no pre-set spending limits such as charge cards. The Federal Reserve has issued public statements indicating that it intends to work with other U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies on a revised proposal; however, any future rulemaking with respect to Basel III standards remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of any such rulemaking will depend on a number of factors, including the content of the final rulemaking, future minimum regulatory requirements and management decisions regarding our product constructs, capital distributions and target capital levels, and such rulemaking could result in significantly higher regulatory capital requirements for the Company and AENB.\n\nThe Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. On top of these minimum capital ratios, the Company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer (SCB) composed entirely of CET1 capital with a floor of 2.5 percent and AENB is subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (CCB). The SCB equals (i) the difference between a bank holding company's starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the Federal Reserve's stress tests described below, plus (ii) one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. As a Category III firm, the required minimum capital ratios for the Company may be further increased by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, if enacted by the Federal Reserve, which must be held in the form of CET1 capital. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero percent; however it could change in the future. If the Federal Reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer, covered banking organizations such as the Company would generally have 12 months after the announcement of such increase to meet the increased buffer requirement, unless the Federal Reserve sets an earlier effective date.\n\nOn August 28, 2024, the Federal Reserve confirmed the SCB for the Company of 2.5 percent, which remained unchanged from the level announced in July 2023. As a result, the effective minimum ratios for the Company (taking into account the SCB requirement) and AENB (taking into account the CCB requirement) are 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, respectively. Banking organizations with ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital or Total capital to risk-weighted assets below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends, repurchases and redemptions of capital securities and executive compensation. A bank holding company's SCB requirement is effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect through September 30 of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a capital plan, as discussed below.\n\nThe Company is also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization's Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). The Company is also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio, which is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to an ex panded concept of leverage ex posure that takes into account both on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, and Category III banking organizations such as the Company are required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0 percent.",

      "answer": "AIG's 2022 filing highlighted its significant exposure to credit risk through fixed income investments and described a robust credit risk management framework involving internal risk ratings, credit reserves, and mitigants like collateral. In 2024, AIG elevated pricing model oversight as part of its risk management, including 'pricing and reserving models' under ERM's Second Line Review and Challenge. This aligns with the pricing model requirements from LMT's 2024 filing, which showed that Level 2 fixed income investments relied on observable market data like interest rates, yield curves, and credit spreads for valuation. The connection suggests AIG strengthened its approach by integrating more rigorous pricing model validation to better capture market-driven valuation changes in fixed income assets, reflecting a strategic evolution from general credit risk controls to more specific model-driven transparency.",

Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty's credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n\nWe devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance and retrocessional insurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. Their primary role is to ensure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. ERM is primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\ndeveloping and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\n- approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified credit professionals;\n- developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n- managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n- evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n\nWe monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also closely monitor the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n\nFor additional information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures see Investments - Credit Ratings - Available-for-Sale Investments.\n\n## Our credit risk management framework incorporates the following elements:\n\n",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

Financial interconnections are utilized by A IG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several A IG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\n\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with A IG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. A IG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal A udit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A  primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability  and reserv e rev iews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n\nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nThe potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit.\n\nOur business is exposed to various catastrophic events, including natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, or pandemic disease, in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year, adversely affecting our business and operating results. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nOur business is exposed to loss events, such as fires or explosions, that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance.\n\nSince we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability  or unwillingness to pay , contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated, which is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\nWe closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n85",

      "question": "How did the shift in MS's use of credit protection instruments from 2023 to 2024 influence their structuring and risk exposure in CLNs, particularly in light of the tranched index CDS strategies described?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MS actively used credit protection through CDS, including tranched index and basket CDS, where the Firm paid a pro rata portion of the total notional amount upon default of underlying names. This strategy was part of a broader risk management framework that included monitoring aggregate market risk limits and managing exposure across different tranches. By 2024, MS had introduced CLNs as part of its structured product offerings, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives where the Firm sells credit protection to the issuer. The tranched CDS strategies from 2023 likely informed the structuring of these CLNs, as both involve layered risk exposure and the transfer of credit risk through defined tranches. However, unlike CDS where MS could receive or provide protection in a more dynamic market context, CLNs represent a more static investment with embedded credit risk tied directly to the reference entity. This evolution suggests a strategic shift from active credit risk trading via CDS to structured product innovation via CLNs, with implications for both the Firm\u2019s risk profile and its client offerings.",

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe  Firm's  variable  interests  in  V IEs  include  debt  and  equity  interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. The Firm's involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n\n- Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its  Investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.\n- Guarantees  issued  and  residual  interests  retained  in  connection  with municipal bond securitizations.\n- Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.\n- Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n- Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n- Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial  involvement  with  the  V IE  and  reassesses  whether  it  is  the  primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the  VIE,  including  the  V IE's  structure  and  activities,  the  power  to  make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.\n\nThe  power  to  make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  may  take  a number  of  different  forms  in  different  types  of  V IEs.  The  Firm  considers servicing  or  collateral  management  decisions  as  representing  the  power  to make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  in  transactions  such  as securitizations or CDOs.  As  a result, the Firm does not consolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager  or  to  require  the  liquidation  of  the  entity.  If  the  Firm  serves  as servicer  or  collateral  manager,  or  has  certain  other  rights  described  in  the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates  only  those  VIEs  for  which  it  holds  a  potentially  significant interest in the V IE.\n\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were  issued  in  a  transaction  sponsored  by  the  Firm  and  the  ex tent  of  the information  available  to  the  Firm  and  to  investors,  the  number,  nature  and involvement  of  investors,  other  rights  held  by  the  Firm  and  investors,  the standardization  of  the  legal  documentation  and  the  level  of  continuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\n\n## Consolidated VIE  Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n\n",

Derivatives (continued)\n\nThe Company manages its credit risk related to derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties in jurisdictions in which it understands that close-out netting should be enforceable and establishing and monitoring exposure limits. The  Company's  OTC-bilateral  derivative  transactions  are  governed  by  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association,  Inc. ('ISDA')  Master  Agreements  which  provide  for  legally  enforceable  set-off  and  close-out  netting  of  exposures  to  specific counterparties  in  the  event  of  early  termination  of  a  transaction,  which  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  events  of  default  and bankruptcy. In the event of an early termination, close-out netting permits the Company (subject to financial regulations such as the Orderly Liquidation Authority under Title II of Dodd-Frank) to set off receivables from the counterparty against payables to the same  counterparty  arising  out  of  all  included  transactions  and  to  apply  collateral  to  the  obligations,  without  application  of  the automatic stay, upon the counterparty's bankruptcy. All of the Company's ISDA Master Agreements also include Credit Support Annex provisions which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in connection with its OTC-bilateral derivatives as required by applicable law. Additionally, effective September 1, 2021, the Company is required to pledge initial margin for certain new OTC-bilateral derivative transactions to third party custodians.\n\nThe  Company's  OTC-cleared  derivatives  are  effected  through  central  clearing  counterparties  and  its  exchange-traded derivatives  are  effected  through  regulated  exchanges.  Such  positions  are  marked  to  market  and  margined  on  a  daily  basis  (both initial margin and variation margin), and the Company has minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by brokers and central clearinghouses to such derivatives.\n\nSee Note 10 for a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation of derivatives.\n\nThe estimated fair values of the Company's net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral were as follows at:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "ITEM 1 |\n\nBusiness\n\n## Dodd-Frank\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), signed into law in 2010, brought about extensive changes to financial regulation in the United States and established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council).\n\nDodd-Frank established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to serve as the central insurance authority in the federal government. While not serving a regulatory function, FIO performs certain duties related to the business of insurance and has authority to collect information on the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. In addition, FIO monitors market access issues, represents the United States in international insurance forums, has authority to determine if certain regulations are preempted by covered agreements, and assists the Secretary of the Treasury in administering the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002.\n\nTitle V of Dodd-Frank authorizes the United States to enter into covered agreements with foreign governments or regulatory entities regarding the business of insurance and reinsurance. On September 22, 2017, the U.S. and the European Union (EU) entered into such an agreement, and on December 18, 2018, the U.S. signed a covered agreement with the UK, which is similar to the agreement with the EU. U.S. state regulators have five years from the dates the covered agreements were signed to adopt reinsurance reforms and group capital requirements that meet the prescribed conditions set forth in the applicable covered agreement or else state laws imposing such reinsurance collateral requirements may be subject to federal preemption, and Solvency II group capital requirements would apply to groups based in the United States. In June 2019, the NAIC adopted amendments to its credit for reinsurance model law and regulation to conform to the requirements of the covered agreements. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted a GCC that, if enacted by the states effective November 7, 2022, is expected to satisfy the conditions in the covered agreements. Certain states have already adopted the GCC requirements in their statutes.\n\nTitle VII of Dodd-Frank provides for significantly increased regulation of, and restrictions on, derivatives markets and transactions that have affected various activities of insurance and other financial services companies, including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps, including security-based swaps, (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated swap execution facilities for certain swaps (other than security-based swaps and (iii) margin and collateral requirements. Increased regulation of, and restrictions on, derivatives markets and transactions, including regulations related to initial margin for swaps and securities-based swaps, could increase the cost of our trading and hedging activities, reduce liquidity and reduce the availability of customized hedging solutions and derivatives.\n\nTitle II of Dodd-Frank (Orderly Liquidation Authority) provides that a financial company whose largest United States subsidiary is an insurer may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the Bankruptcy Code. That process is to be administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a determination that the company is: (i) in default or in danger of default, (ii) would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability were it to fail and be resolved, (iii) is not likely to attract private sector alternatives to default and (iv) is not suitable for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. Dodd-Frank authorizes possible assessments to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II. U.S. insurance subsidiaries of any such financial company, however, would be subject to rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings under state insurance law.\n\n## ERISA\n\nWe provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and/or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code). Plans subject to ERISA include certain pension and profit-sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. As a result, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code are subject to enforcement by the Department of Labor (DOL), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\n## Standard of Care Developments\n\nWe and our distributors are subject to laws and regulations regarding the standard of care applicable to sales of our products and the provision of advice to our customers. In recent years, many of these laws and regulations have been revised or reexamined while others have been newly adopted. We continue to closely follow these legislative and regulatory activities. Changes in standard of care requirements or new standards issued by governmental authorities, such as the DOL, the SEC, the NAIC or state regulators and/or legislators, have impacted, and may in the future impact, our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 13",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDodd-Frank also expanded the definition of 'swap' and mandated the SEC and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') to study whether 'stable value contracts' should be treated as swaps. Pursuant to the definition and the SEC's and CFTC's interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries, other than stable value contracts, might also be treated as swaps. Special federal banking rules apply to certain derivatives contracts and other agreements with some banking institutions and certain of their affiliates. These rules generally limit or delay the rights of counterparties upon the insolvency of such banking institutions which could increase our counterparty risk.\n\nIn  2024,  the  principal  U.S.  federal  banking  regulatory  agencies  reproposed  for  public  comment  regulations  to  implement  certain  international  'Basel  III'  capital standards, which could affect capital charges applicable to banks and their affiliates engaged in derivatives activities. This could increase the costs of our risk mitigation using derivatives, as well as impact the availability of derivatives from our counterparties.\n\nIn 2023, the SEC adopted rules to require that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require every direct participant of the agency  to  submit  for  clearing  eligible  secondary  market  transactions  in  U.S.  Treasury  securities.  The  rule  effectively  requires  such  participants  to  clear  eligible  cash transactions in U.S. Treasury securities beginning on December 31, 2025. Furthermore, the rule effectively requires eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury securities to be cleared beginning on June 30, 2026. As a result, certain transactions between such participants and us will be required to be cleared. The rule's potential effect on the U.S. Treasury markets is uncertain.\n\n## Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\n\nU.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that meet the definition of a 'security,' including variable annuity contracts and variable  life  insurance  policies,  and  certain  fix ed  interest  rate  or  index -linked  contracts  with  features  that  require  them  to  be  registered  as  securities  or  ex empt  from registration. As a result, some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under these securities laws.\n\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered 'securities' under local law, and we may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.\n\nSome of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies with separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 'Investment Company Act') or are exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act. Such separate accounts are generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies associated with these separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act') or are exempt from registration under the Securities Act. One of our insurance subsidiaries issues a fix ed interest rate contract with features that require it to be registered under the Securities Act.\n\nCertain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nTwo of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act') and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. The SEC, CFTC and FINRA from time to time propose and adopt rules and regulations that impact broker-dealers and products deemed to be securities. One of our U.S. broker-dealers serves as the principal underwriter and distributor of these variable products and other securities offerings. Our broker-dealer distributes these products via unaffiliated third-party broker-dealers and financial intermediaries that sell these products to end investors. Under SEC rules, these selling broker-dealers are required to comply with various SEC and FINRA rules and regulations, including Regulation Best Interest. SEC rules also require these selling broker-dealers to disclose the nature of services, their standard of conduct, and their conflicts of interest to their retail customers. With regard to insurance products, the NAIC revised its Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation to add a 'best interest' standard for the sale of annuities. All of our insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary states have adopted the model regulation or another form of the best interest standard.",

There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities or voluntary actions taken by the public.\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  adversely  impacted  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  There  are  no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of this pandemic or a similar health epidemic in the future is highly uncertain and subject to change. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response, further impacts our business, results of operations and financial  condition  will  depend  on  future  developments,  which  are  uncertain,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  duration  of  the pandemic and its impact on the global economy, including how quickly and to what extent we can continue to progress toward more consistent economic and operating conditions. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially  adverse  impacts  to  our  business  and  our  result  of  operations  as  a  result  of  its  global  economic  impact,  including  any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\n\n## Competition and Technology\n\nSubstantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry and compete in all categories of payment, including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments. We compete against general purpose payments networks, debit and local networks, ACH and real-time account-based payments  systems,  alternative  payments  systems  and  new  entrants  (focused  on  online  activity  across  various  channels  and processing  payments  using  in-house  capabilities),  national  networks  and  digital  currencies.  We  also  face  competition  from companies  that  provide  alternatives  to  our  value-added  services  and  adjacent  network  capabilities  (including  open  banking  and digital identity).\n\nOur traditional competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs,  services,  and  payment  capabilities  than  we  offer  or  may  use  more  effective  advertising  and  marketing  strategies  to achieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have. They may also introduce their own innovative programs, value-added services and capabilities that adversely impact our growth.\n\nCertain of our competitors to our core network operate three-party payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and these competitors may derive competitive advantages from their business models. If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not, we could lose business to these competitors. See 'Business - Competition' in Part I, Item 1.\n\nNew  entrants  against  whom  we  compete  have  developed  alternative  payments  systems,  e-commerce  payments  systems  and payments  systems  for  mobile  devices,  as  well  as  physical  store  locations.  A  number  of  these  new  entrants  rely  principally  on technology to support their services that provides cost advantages, and as a result may enjoy lower costs than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nOur ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation, competitionrelated regulatory proceedings and central bank activity and legislative activity.\n\nIf we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.\n\nAs the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including:\n\n- Parties  that  process  our  transactions  in  certain  countries  may  try  to  eliminate  our  position  as  an  intermediary  in  the  payment process. For example, merchants could switch (and in some cases are switching) transactions directly with issuers. Additionally, processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Large scale consolidation within processors could result  in  these  processors  developing  bilateral  agreements  or  in  some  cases  switching  the  entire  transaction  on  their  own network, thereby disintermediating us.\n- Industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account to account payments, which could facilitate P2M transactions that compete with our core payments network.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Organization\n\nMastercard  Incorporated  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  including  Mastercard  InternaEonal  Incorporated  ('Mastercard  InternaEonal'  and  together  with Mastercard Incorporated, 'Mastercard' or the 'Company'), is a technology company in the global payments industry. Mastercard connects consumers, financial i ns EtuEons,  merchants,  governments,  digital  partners,  businesses  and  other  organizaEons  worldwide  by  enabling  electronic  payments  and  making  those payment  transacEons  secure,  simple,  smart  and  accessible. The  Company  makes  payments  easier  and  more  efficient  by  providing  a  wide  range  of  payment s ol uEons  and  services  using  its  family  of  well-known  and  trusted  brands,  including  Mastercard\u00ae,  Maestro\u00ae  and  Cirrus\u00ae. The  Company  operates  a  payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and Mastercard customers.  Through its unique and proprietary global payments network, the  Company  switches  (authorizes,  clears  and  seNles)  payment  transacEons. The  Company  has  addiEonal  payments  capabiliEes  that  include  automated cl e a ri ng hous e ('ACH') tra ns a cEons  (both ba tch a nd rea l-Eme a ccount-based payments).  Using these capabiliEes, the Company offers consumer and commercial payment  products,  captures  new  payment  flows  and  provides  services  and  soluEons.  The  Company's  services  and  soluEons  include,  among  others,  security s ol uEons, consumer acquisiEon and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on Mastercard's principled and responsible use of secure data. The Company's capabiliEes strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent.  For the global payments network, Mastercard's franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. The Company employs a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which it operates.\n\nMastercard is not a financial institution. The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connecEon with merchants' acceptance of the Company's products.  In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the Company's financial institution customers.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nConsolida'on and basis of presenta'on -  The  cons ol i da te d fina nci a l  s ta te me nts  i ncl ude  the  a ccounts  of Ma s terca rd a nd i ts  ma jori ty-owned a nd controlled enEEes , i ncl udi ng a ny va ri a bl e  i nte re s t e nEEe s  ('VIEs ') for whi ch the  Compa ny is  the prima ry beneficia ry.

The  Company consolidates acquisiEons as of the date the  Company has obtained a  controlling  financial  interest.  Intercompany  transacEons  and  balances  have  been  eliminated  in  consolidaEon.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentaEon.  The reclassificaEon had no impact on previously reported net revenue, operaEng income or net income.

      "question": "How did AXP's 2022 regulatory constraints influence AENB's ability to offer competitive deposit rates in 2024, given that AENB paid $5.0 billion in dividends to its parent during that year?",
      "answer": "AXP's 2022 regulatory environment emphasized strict capital adequacy standards and the requirement for AXP to act as a 'source of strength' to AENB. These constraints directly affected AENB's capital flexibility in 2024, especially in light of the $5.0 billion in dividends it paid to its parent during that year. Banking regulations limited AENB\u2019s ability to distribute capital if it would cause the bank to fall below required capital levels or be considered an unsafe banking practice. This regulatory pressure, combined with the significant dividend outflow, constrained AENB\u2019s ability to maintain high deposit interest rates, as doing so could have further impacted its capital ratios and triggered additional regulatory scrutiny or restrictions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AXP(2022) \u2192 Banking Regulations: AXP was subject to stringent regulatory constraints in 2022, including capital adequacy requirements and the 'source of strength' doctrine, which limited its ability to distribute capital.",
        "Hop 2: Banking Regulations \u2192 AENB: AENB, as a subsidiary bank, was directly subject to these regulations, which prohibited dividend distributions if they would cause the bank to fall below regulatory capital thresholds.",
        "Hop 3: AENB \u2190 AXP(2024): In 2024, AENB paid $5.0 billion in dividends to AXP, which, under continued regulatory oversight, constrained its ability to offer competitive deposit rates without further eroding its capital base."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## SUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. The financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment.\n\nGovernmental authorities have focused, and we believe will continue to focus, considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations, and as a result, we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework, governance structures, practices and procedures. Reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations, as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies, including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our products, practices and procedures, restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations, enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of those investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\n\nIn addition, legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the offering of consumer financial products and the operation of payment networks, resulting in changes to certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes.\n\nSee 'Risk Factors-Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks' for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Banking Regulation\n\nFederal and state banking laws, regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company (which, for purposes of this section, refers to American Express Company as a bank holding company), TRS and our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB). Both the Company and TRS are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve and AENB is supervised, regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures, any of which could compromise our competitive position. Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and by non-U.S. government agencies and regulatory bodies.\n\n## Activities\n\nThe BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities. As noted above, each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company, which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities. In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status, we must meet certain eligibility requirements. Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be 'well capitalized' and 'well managed,' and AENB must have received at least a 'satisfactory' rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). The Company and TRS engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies, including, in particular, providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services. If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status, it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company, and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound (which such authorities generally interpret broadly).",

It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on preferred and common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders generated over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies are required by statute to be a source of strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries and should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to do so. On an annual basis, we are required to develop and maintain a capital plan, which includes planned dividends. We may be subject to limitations and restrictions on our dividends, if, among other things, (i) our regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) we are required to resubmit our capital plan.\n\n## BANK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, AENB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $5.0 billion. AENB is limited in its ability to pay dividends by banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. In general, applicable federal and state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as AENB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available retained earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. If AENB's risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and applicable buffers, it will face graduated constraints on dividends and other capital distributions. In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB must also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies. In addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.",

The use of social media and similar channels has the potential to intensify and accelerate such a decrease in confidence in soundness.\n\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB's capital levels. The FDIA's brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid.

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab remained under constraints from its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, including a Stockholder Agreement that limited TD Bank and its affiliates to owning no more than 9.9% of Schwab common stock. As part of the acquisition, Schwab issued both voting and nonvoting common stock, with TD Bank holding approximately 79 million shares of nonvoting common stock as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, Schwab had transitioned to using the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share (EPS), which assumed the conversion of all nonvoting common stock into voting common stock for EPS reporting purposes. This evolution reflects how Schwab\u2019s capital structure matured post-acquisition, with nonvoting shares\u2014originally issued to TD Bank\u2014now playing a defined role in financial reporting and dilution analysis, even as TD Bank\u2019s ownership remained capped.",

Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:\n\n- Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, strategic transactions, progress on achieving the expected benefits from our TD Ameritrade acquisition, or ratings from third parties;\n- The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors;\n- Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results; and\n- Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders.\n\nChanges in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.\n\n## Future sales of CSC's equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC's common stock and result in dilution.\n\nCSC's certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC's Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval. CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC's common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC's common stock.\n\n## Our ongoing relationships with TD Bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us.\n\nAlthough our acquisition of TD Ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in CSC either (i) being deemed to be 'controlled' by TD Bank (as that term is interpreted by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act or HOLA) or (ii) being deemed to be in 'control' of any of TD Bank's depository institutions, changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the Federal Reserve's regulations. This could occur if TD Bank and its affiliates own more than 9.9% of Schwab common stock, as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve. While the Stockholder Agreement between CSC and TD Bank prohibits TD Bank and its affiliates from exceeding the 9.9% threshold, it could happen unintentionally. This presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the TD Bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage. The Stockholder Agreement contains provisions to address such situations.\n\nUnder the IDA agreement, we are only permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the TD Depository Institutions by a set amount during each 12-month period, subject to certain limitations and adjustments including only moving IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations and maintaining a minimum $50 billion IDA sweep balance through June 2031. The bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the IDA agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the TD Depository Institutions. When we are permitted to reduce the IDA balances, we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital. In addition, in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions, resulting in us having an expense rather than revenue.\n\n## Item 1B.

In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company issued shares of CSC common stock and a new, nonvoting class of CSC common stock. Immediately prior to the acquisition, on October 6, 2020, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to create the nonvoting class of common stock with 300 million shares authorized for issuance and to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock by the same amount. Each share of nonvoting common stock has identical rights to common stock, including liquidation and dividend rights, except that holders of nonvoting common stock have no voting rights other than over matters that significantly and adversely affect the rights or preferences of the nonvoting common stock, or as required by applicable law. Holders of nonvoting common stock are restricted from transferring shares except for permitted inside or outside transfers, as defined in the certificate of incorporation. Shares of nonvoting stock transferred in a permitted outside transfer are automatically converted to shares of common stock.\n\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, CSC issued approximately 177 million shares of common stock and approximately 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates on October 6, 2020. Those shares of common stock and nonvoting common stock were issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Following this issuance, TD Bank exchanged an aggregate of approximately 2 million shares of CSC common stock for an equal number of shares of CSC nonvoting common stock and held approximately 79 million shares of nonvoting common stock as of December 31, 2021. TD Bank and its affiliates are not permitted to own more than 9.9% of CSC common stock. This limit is interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve and includes shares of CSC common stock deemed to be beneficially owned directly or indirectly by TD Bank and its affiliates.\n\nOn June 1, 2021, the Company redeemed all of the 600,000 outstanding shares of its 6.00% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series C, and the corresponding 24,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Series C Preferred Stock. The depositary shares were redeemed at a redemption price of $25 per depositary share for a total of $600 million.\n\nOn March 30, 2021, the Company issued and sold 24,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 4.450% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series J, $.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent of $25 per Depositary Share). The net proceeds of the offering were $584 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\n\nOn March 18, 2021, the Company issued and sold 2,250,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 4.000% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series I, $.01 par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent of $1,000 per Depositary Share). The net proceeds of the offering were $2.2 billion, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\n\nOn December 11, 2020, the Company issued and sold 2,500,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 4.000% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series H, $.01 par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent of $1,000 per Depositary Share). The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $2.47 billion, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\n\nOn April 30, 2020, the Company issued and sold 2,500,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 5.375% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series G, $.01 par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent of $1,000 per Depositary Share). The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $2.47 billion, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\n\nOn January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. There were no repurchases of CSC's common stock under this authorization during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

      "answer": "In 2023, holders of Series C Preferred Stock had no voting rights except for specific corporate actions involving changes to equity structure or asset disposition, requiring approval only if the preferred stockholders would receive different securities, cash, or property than Class A Common Stockholders. This governance asymmetry meant that V could adjust the capital structure by increasing the number of Class A Common Stock shares issued from 1,594 in 2023 to 1,733 in 2024 without seeking approval from Series C Preferred Stockholders. Since this change did not trigger the defined matters requiring preferred stockholder consent, the company was able to reallocate equity freely within the bounds of its corporate governance framework.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife introduced the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method for estimating unpaid claims liabilities for Protection Life, relying on historical claim experience with higher credibility on expected loss ratios in more recent incurral months. This methodology was carried forward in 2023, where it continued to shape the assumptions used in calculating unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The Protection Life segment's incurred and paid claim development pattern in 2023 showed a cumulative development of 95.8% over the first five years (58.2% + 31.7% + 4.2% + 1.2% + 0.7%), indicating that most claims were settled early, consistent with the method\u2019s reliance on both expected loss ratios and historical data. This reflects a stable application of the method year-over-year, with no major changes in the claim settlement patterns.",

Insurance (continued)\n\n## Significant Methodologies and Assumptions\n\nThe  Latin America  segment  establishes  liabilities  for  unpaid  losses,  which  are  equal  to  the  accumulation  of  unpaid reported claims, plus an estimate for claims IBNR.\n\nIn  general  terms,  for  both  the  Protection  Life  and  Protection  Health  products,  the  methodology  for  IBNR  is  the Bornhuetter-Ferguson  Method,  with  factors  derived  by  examining  the  experience  of  historical  claims.  In  the  more  recent incurral months, the credibility is higher on expected loss ratios and lower on claims calculated using the experience-derived factors. The credibility grows for the factors as incurral months become older.\n\nFor Protection Health products, claim duration can be very long due to the multiple incidences that may occur over time for a single claim. The number of claims reported per year is based on the original claim occurrence date for each individual claim. Any subsequent claims that are considered part of the original claim occurrence are not counted as a new claim. For Protection Life products, claims are based upon individual death claims.\n\nThe assumptions used in calculating the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for Protection Life and Protection Health are updated annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience.\n\nCertain of our Protection Life customers have experience-rated contracts, whereby the group sponsor participates in the favorable  and/or  adverse  claim  experience,  including  favorable  and/or  adverse  prior  year  development.  Claim  experience adjustments on these contracts are not reflected in the foregoing incurred and paid claim development tables, but are instead reflected as an increase (adverse experience) or decrease (favorable experience) to premiums on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses were not discounted.\n\nFor Protection Life and Protection Health products, claim counts initially include claims that do not ultimately result in a liability. These claims are omitted from the claim counts once it is determined that there is no liability.",

      "question": "How did the shift in MET's Separate Accounts exposure to Level 3 assets from 2023 to 2024 reflect changes in the company's pension plan investment strategy, particularly in terms of fair value estimation methods and liquidity characteristics?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MET's Separate Accounts held $1,147 million in Level 3 assets, which are characterized by low price transparency and infrequent trading, requiring significant unobservable inputs for valuation. By 2024, the company continued to disclose Level 3 assets within Separate Accounts, noting that these accounts invest in assets with little or no price transparency, often requiring additional time to liquidate. The Level 3 asset category in 2024 specifically included alternative asset classes such as private equity and real estate funds, which are inherently less liquid and more reliant on unobservable inputs. This evolution suggests a continued strategic emphasis on alternative investments despite their valuation complexity, with the company maintaining a significant exposure to less transparent, longer-duration assets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that CMBS were a significant component of their structured securities portfolio, which included RMBS and ABS, and were subject to various financial risks such as credit and market valuation risk. The company evaluated these risks quarterly and adjusted assessments based on market conditions. In 2023, MetLife's fair value hierarchy for CMBS showed a total estimated fair value of $9,949 million, with $9,099 million in Level 2 and $850 million in Level 3, indicating a continued but more precisely categorized exposure. This suggests a strategic refinement in managing structured products, with a focus on transparency and risk stratification.",

Investments\n\nSee Note 10 for information about the fair value hierarchy for investments and the related valuation methodologies.\n\n## Investment Risks and Uncertainties\n\nInvestments are exposed to the following primary sources of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity, market valuation, currency and real estate risk. The financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks, are those associated with the determination of estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions, the recognition of ACL  and  impairments,  the  recognition  of  income  on  certain  investments  and  the  potential  consolidation  of  VIEs.  The  use  of different  methodologies,  assumptions  and  inputs  relating  to  these  financial  statement  risks  may  have  a  material  effect  on  the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe determination of ACL and impairments is highly subjective and is based upon quarterly evaluations and assessments of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\n\nThe  recognition  of  income  on  certain  investments  (e.g.  structured  securities,  including  mortgage-backed  securities,  assetbacked securities ('ABS'), certain structured investment transactions and FVO Securities) is dependent upon certain factors such as prepayments and defaults, and changes in such factors could result in changes in amounts to be earned.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS by Sector\n\nThe following table presents fixed maturity securities AFS by sector. U.S. corporate and foreign corporate sectors include redeemable preferred stock. RMBS includes agency, prime, alternative and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. ABS includes securities collateralized by corporate loans and consumer loans. Municipals includes taxable and tax-exempt revenue bonds and, to  a  much  lesser  extent,  general  obligations  of  states,  municipalities  and  political  subdivisions.  Commercial  mortgage-backed securities  ('CMBS')  primarily  includes  securities  collateralized  by  multiple  commercial  mortgage  loans.  RMBS,  ABS  and CMBS are, collectively, 'Structured Products.'",

      "answer": "In 2023, Corebridge reduced its drawdowns under the DDTL Facility by repaying $1.25 billion, leaving only $250 million outstanding by year-end. This liquidity optimization allowed Corebridge to increase shareholder returns, as evidenced by the $307 million special dividend paid in December 2023. By 2024, AIG reported equity method income from Corebridge based on dividends received and stock price changes since June 9, 2024, indicating that the prior year's deleveraging improved Corebridge's capacity to distribute capital to shareholders, directly benefiting AIG's investment returns.",

        "Hop 2: DDTL Facility \u2192 Corebridge: The DDTL Facility is a key liquidity instrument for Corebridge with no recourse to AIG, and its partial repayment signaled improved financial positioning",

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG disclosed that CMBS were part of its structured securities portfolio, which included RMBS, ABS & CLO, and CMBS under the broader category of Structured Products. By 2024, AIG's 10-K filing showed that its CMBS holdings increased from $33 million in 2023 to $43 million in 2024, rising from 2% to 3% of total fixed maturity securities. This indicates a strategic shift toward increasing exposure to commercial real estate-related debt instruments within the structured products category. The increase in CMBS allocation suggests a more targeted approach to mortgage-backed assets, particularly in commercial sectors, compared to the prior year.",

      "question": "How did the decline in MET's securities lending activity from 2023 to 2024 impact the size and liquidity profile of their reinvestment portfolio, given the changes in cash collateral and fair value metrics?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MET reported a securities lending fair value of $10,510 million with $10,788 million in cash collateral received, which supported a reinvestment portfolio valued at $10,553 million. By 2024, the requirement to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice introduced risk into the reinvestment portfolio's liquidity, despite its composition of high-quality, liquid assets. This suggests that while the reinvestment portfolio remained largely intact, its effective liquidity was constrained by the potential for rapid collateral return obligations, reflecting a shift from the more stable position seen in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: MET(2023) \u2192 Securities Lending: MET faced risks related to liquidity and potential obligations to return significant cash collateral under securities lending agreements.",

        "Hop 3: Reinvestment Portfolio \u2190 MET(2024): In 2024, MET noted that if required to return cash collateral quickly, it might have difficulty selling investments timely or at favorable prices, indicating increased liquidity risk in the reinvestment portfolio."

      "answer": "In 2023, JPM disclosed that its Other Asset-Backed Securities had a total fair value of $2.842 billion, with gross unrealized losses of $69 million, and these securities included credit card receivables as part of their underlying collateral structure. In 2024, the firm continued to securitize and sell credit card receivables as part of its broader loan securitization strategy, with its maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to related vehicles reaching $5.8 billion. The credit quality of these asset-backed securities, which had an average rating of AA and a weighted average duration of less than one year in 2024, suggests that JPM maintained a relatively strong credit profile in its securitized credit card portfolio despite the prior year's unrealized losses.",

      "answer": "MET's exposure to Pass-Through Mortgage-Backed Securities decreased from $12.758 billion in 2022 to an implied portion of the $64.359 billion in Mortgage-backed, asset-backed, and collateralized loan obligations securities in 2024. This shift occurred within a broader increase in Structured Products holdings, which rose from $56.3 billion in 2023 to $63.7 billion in 2024. The RMBS portfolio remained diversified by risk profile, including Agency and Non-Agency securities such as prime, Alt-A, and sub-prime loans, indicating a continued but more complex exposure to underlying mortgage assets. The decrease in reported Pass-Through MBS suggests MET may have increased securitization or shifted toward more complex structured instruments, while maintaining a significant $89.812 billion mortgage loan portfolio on their balance sheet.",

Our investment selection criteria and monitoring include review of credit ratings, characteristics of the assets underlying the securities, borrower characteristics and the level of credit enhancement. We held $63.7 billion and $56.3 billion of Structured Products at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS sections below.\n\n## RMBS\n\nOur RMBS portfolio is broadly diversified by security type and risk profile.\n\nOn a security type basis, RMBS includes collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\n\nOn a risk profile basis, RMBS includes Agency and Non-Agency securities. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association,  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  or  G overnment  National  Mortgage  Association.  Non-Agency  securities  include  prime,  prime investor,  non-qualified  residential  mortgage  ('NQM'),  and  alternative  residential  mortgage  loans  ('Alt-A'),  and  reperforming  and  sub-prime  mortgage-backed securities. Prime (owner-occupied) and prime investor (non-owner-occupied) loans were originated to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. NQM and Alt-A are classifications of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime.  Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles, while reperforming loans were previously delinquent that returned to performing status.",

      "question": "How did AIG's exposure to RMBS within structured securities change from 2022 to 2023, and what adjustments were made in accounting treatment for structured securities to reflect evolving credit risk expectations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AIG disclosed a total RMBS fair value of $6,516 million with gross unrealized losses of $148 million. RMBS is a subset of structured securities, which in 2023 became subject to updated accounting treatment for structured securities, particularly those not of high credit quality, where expected credit losses and prepayments now influence recalculated effective yields and amortized cost adjustments. In 2023, AIG updated its methodology to reflect changes in expected undiscounted future cash flows for structured securities, impacting net investment income and credit loss allowances. This shift indicates a more dynamic and risk-adjusted approach to managing structured securities, particularly RMBS, in response to evolving credit risk profiles.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One was subject to the Market Risk Rule, which required adjustments to its risk-based capital ratios to reflect market risk in its trading book, and its CET1 capital requirement under Basel III was part of a broader stress capital buffer framework that set minimum capital requirements at 10.1% for CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios. By 2024, Capital One remained subject to the Market Risk Rule, but as a Category III institution under Basel III, it maintained a lower minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% under the standardized approach, alongside a capital conservation buffer. The reduction in CET1 requirement from 10.1% in 2022 to 4.5% in 2024 suggests increased capital management flexibility, assuming the company continued to exceed these thresholds. This evolution reflects a shift in regulatory pressure and potentially greater room for capital distributions or strategic investments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBased on the Company's 2020 supervisory stress testing results, the Company's stress capital buffer requirement was 5.6% for the period  from  October  1,  2020  through  September  30,  2021.  Therefore,  the  Company's  minimum  capital  requirements  plus  the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework were 10.1%, 11.6% and 13.6%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021.\n\nBased on the Company's 2021 supervisory stress testing results, the Company's stress capital buffer requirement for the period beginning on October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is 2.5%. Therefore, the Company's minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Banks. The capital conservation buffer for the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Accordingly, each Bank's minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5% respectively.\n\nIf the Company or any of the Banks fails to maintain its capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable capital  conservation  buffer  requirements,  it  will  face  increasingly  strict  automatic  limitations  on  capital  distributions  and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, each of the Company and the Banks exceeded the minimum capital requirements and  the  capital  conservation  buffer  requirements  applicable  to  them,  and  each  of  the  Company  and  the  Banks  was  'wellcapitalized.' The 'well-capitalized' standards applicable to the Company are established in the Federal Reserve's regulations, and the 'well-capitalized' standards applicable to the Banks are established in the OCC's PCA capital requirements.\n\n## Market Risk Rule\n\nThe 'Market Risk Rule' supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2021, the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See 'MD&amp;A-Market Risk Profile' below for additional information.\n\n## CECL Transition Rule\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the 'CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit loss ('CECL') standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('Basel Committee'), along with certain provisions of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ('Dodd-Frank Act') and other capital provisions.\n\nAs a bank holding company ('BHC') with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules.\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action ('PCA') capital regulations.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described in 'Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital and Stress Testing Regulation-Stress Capital Buffer Rule.' Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. For information on the recognition of AOCI in regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel III Capital Rules, see 'Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital and Stress Testing Regulation-Basel III Finalization Proposal.'\n\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') (collectively, 'Federal Banking Agencies') adopted a final rule ('CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax  'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact were being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\nCapital Impact Delayed\n\nPhase In Period\n\n",

      "question": "How did the 2% aggregate debit balance requirement under the Uniform Net Capital Rule impact TDAC's cash deposit and collateral obligations in 2023 compared to 2022, and what does this reveal about the regulatory constraints on Schwab's broker-dealer subsidiaries during periods of market volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TDAC, as a registered broker-dealer, was subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule, which required it to maintain minimum net capital of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement. This regulatory framework constrained capital flexibility, as broker-dealers could not make certain distributions or repayments if net capital fell below thresholds. In 2023, TDAC remained subject to the same 2% requirement and was also explicitly noted to be under cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearinghouses like the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. These collateral obligations fluctuated based on the nature and size of clients' trading activity and market volatility. The persistence of the 2% rule across years indicates that Schwab's broker-dealer subsidiaries, including TDAC, remained under consistent regulatory pressure to maintain liquidity and financial soundness, particularly during volatile periods when collateral needs could spike suddenly.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SCHW(2022) \u2192 TDAC: Schwab's 2022 filing explicitly states that TDAC computes net capital under the alternative method of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires maintaining minimum net capital of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances or a minimum dollar requirement.",
        "Hop 2: TDAC \u2192 Cash Deposit and Collateral Requirements: TDAC, as a clearing broker-dealer, is subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearinghouses, which may fluctuate based on trading activity and market volatility.",
        "Hop 3: Cash Deposit and Collateral Requirements \u2190 SCHW(2023): Schwab's 2023 filing confirms that TDAC continues to be subject to these collateral obligations, which are directly influenced by the 2% net capital rule and external market conditions."

The capital conservation buffer and countercyclical buffer were 2.5% and zero percent, respectively, for both periods presented. If either buffer falls below the minimum requirement, the Company would be subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At December 31, 2021, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios were 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance sheets of CSPB and Trust Bank primarily consisted of investment securities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, CSPB held total assets of $39.2 billion and $31.6 billion, respectively, and Trust Bank held total assets of $15.9 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Based on their regulatory capital ratios, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, CSPB and Trust Bank are considered well capitalized under their respective regulatory capital rules.\n\nAs securities broker-dealers, CS&amp;Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc. are subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule. CS&amp;Co and TDAC each compute net capital under the alternative method permitted by the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement, which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer. TD Ameritrade, Inc. is required to maintain minimum net capital of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement.

      "answer": "The total assets at Schwab's banking subsidiaries decreased from $44.1 billion in 2022 (CSPB: $31.6B, Trust Bank: $12.5B) to $37.9 billion in 2023 (CSPB: $27.7B, Trust Bank: $10.2B). This reduction in assets likely affected TDAC's compliance with the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which prohibits broker-dealers from repaying subordinated borrowings if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.

Institutions are assigned one of four ratings ('outstanding,' 'satisfactory,' 'needs to improve,' or 'substantial noncompliance'). The failure of an institution to receive at least a 'satisfactory' rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions or opening branch offices.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve's long-held position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions, the so-called 'source of strength doctrine.' In effect, the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress.\n\n## Volcker Rule\n\nCSC and its subsidiaries are subject to the Volcker Rule, which generally prohibits proprietary trading or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to certain exemptions, in each case as the applicable terms are defined in the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations.\n\n## Broker-Dealer, FCM, FDM, and Investment Advisor Regulation\n\nOur principal broker-dealer subsidiaries, CS&amp;Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, are each registered as a broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission), the fifty states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. CS&amp;Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., CSIM, and certain of our other subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Charles Schwab Futures and Forex LLC (CSFF, formerly known as TD Ameritrade Futures &amp; Forex LLC) is registered as an FCM and FDM with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nMuch of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to SROs. Our principal broker-dealers are each members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). In addition, CS&amp;Co is a member of Nasdaq Stock Market, Cboe EDGX and MEMX, and TDAC is a member of NYSE Arca, Nasdaq Stock Market, Cboe EDGX and MEMX. In addition to the SEC, the primary regulators of our principal broker-dealers are FINRA and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The National Futures Association (NFA) is the primary regulator for CSFF's futures, commodities, and forex trading activities.\n\nThe principal purpose of regulating these entities is the protection of clients and securities markets. The regulations cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients' funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties, and the conduct of directors, officers, and employees.\n\nOur principal broker-dealer entities are subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer and it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule.\n\nThe Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits broker-dealers from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances or loans or repaying subordinated loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.\n\nIn addition to net capital requirements, as a self-clearing broker-dealer, CS&amp;Co, and as a clearing broker-dealer, TDAC, are subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses, such as the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation, which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients' trading activity and market volatility.",

This suggests that actual claims experience was worse than initially estimated for those years. In 2024, MET clarified that for Protection Life products, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method assigns higher credibility to expected loss ratios in more recent incurral months, with credibility shifting toward experience-derived factors as months age. This represents a methodological shift from 2023, indicating increased reliance on historical data as claims mature. The 2024 reserving strategy also showed liabilities for unpaid claims at $1.2 billion, with a $166 million discount applied, suggesting a more refined approach to capital allocation. This evolution implies MET is adjusting its reserving strategy to place more trust in historical patterns as claims age, while maintaining flexibility through annual assumption updates.",

In the more recent incurral months, the credibility is higher on expected loss ratios and lower on claims calculated using the experience-derived factors. The credibility grows for the factors as incurral months become older.\n\nFor Protection Health products, claim duration can be very long due to the multiple incidences that may occur over time for a single claim. Depending on the characteristics of the product, the number of claims reported per year may or may not be based on the original claim occurrence date for each individual claim.

Future Policy Benefits (continued)\n\n## Significant Methodologies and Assumptions\n\nFor Group Life, the IBNR liability is determined by using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method, with factors derived by examining the experience of historical claims. A pending liability is also calculated for claims that have been reported but have not been paid. A claim eligibility ratio based on past ex perience is applied to the face amount of individual claims.\n\nFor Group Disability, the IBNR liability is calculated by applying a percentage to premiums in-force based on the expected delay as evidenced by the experience in the portfolio. The IBNR liability is then allocated back into different incurral years based on historical run-off patterns. As the benefit for this class of business is a regular series of payments, an additional reserve is required for the liability for ongoing benefit payments - claims in course of payment ('CICP'). The assumptions employed in the calculation of the CICP are adjusted for the Company's own experience.\n\nAn expense liability is held for the future expenses associated with the payment of incurred but not yet paid claims. This is expressed as a percentage of the underlying claims liability and is based on past ex perience and the future ex pense structure.\n\nThe assumptions used in calculating the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for  G roup  Disability and  G roup  Life are updated annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience.\n\nNo additional premiums or return premiums have been accrued as a result of the prior year development.\n\nThe liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment ex penses were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were discounted using interest rates ranging from 1% to 7%, based on the incurral year. The total discount applied to these liabilities was $166 million and $163 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amount of interest accretion recognized was $44 million, $37 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were reflected in policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nThe Company tracks claim frequency by the number of reported claims as identified by a unique claim number assigned to individual claimants.

Insurance (continued)\n\n## Significant Methodologies and Assumptions\n\nThe  Latin America  segment  establishes  liabilities  for  unpaid  losses,  which  are  equal  to  the  accumulation  of  unpaid reported claims, plus an estimate for claims IBNR.\n\nIn  general  terms,  for  both  the  Protection  Life  and  Protection  Health  products,  the  methodology  for  IBNR  is  the Bornhuetter-Ferguson  Method,  with  factors  derived  by  examining  the  experience  of  historical  claims.  In  the  more  recent incurral months, the credibility is higher on expected loss ratios and lower on claims calculated using the experience-derived factors. The credibility grows for the factors as incurral months become older.\n\nFor Protection Health products, claim duration can be very long due to the multiple incidences that may occur over time for a single claim. The number of claims reported per year is based on the original claim occurrence date for each individual claim. Any subsequent claims that are considered part of the original claim occurrence are not counted as a new claim. For Protection Life products, claims are based upon individual death claims.\n\nThe assumptions used in calculating the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for Protection Life and Protection Health are updated annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience.\n\nCertain of our Protection Life customers have experience-rated contracts, whereby the group sponsor participates in the favorable  and/or  adverse  claim  experience,  including  favorable  and/or  adverse  prior  year  development.  Claim  experience adjustments on these contracts are not reflected in the foregoing incurred and paid claim development tables, but are instead reflected as an increase (adverse experience) or decrease (favorable experience) to premiums on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses were not discounted.\n\nFor Protection Life and Protection Health products, claim counts initially include claims that do not ultimately result in a liability. These claims are omitted from the claim counts once it is determined that there is no liability.",

      "question": "How did the change in AIG's reinsurance transactions between 2022 and 2023 reflect the impact of evolving risk transfer requirements, particularly in terms of the capital impact management for life and universal life policies and the structure of funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Re?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AIG's reinsurance transactions were subject to risk transfer requirements under U.S. GAAP, which necessitated an evaluation to determine whether these transactions met the criteria for insurance risk transfer. If not, deposit accounting was applied, with a reinsurance risk charge recorded in income. Additionally, one affiliated reinsurance arrangement involved a $125 million bilateral letter of credit issued in May 2022, which was subject to reimbursement by Corebridge Parent in case of a drawdown. By 2023, AIG had structured major reinsurance transactions with Fortitude Re as modco and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld. These arrangements involved approximately $27.6 billion in Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and $3.0 billion in General Insurance Run-Off Lines reserves ceded to Fortitude Re. The funds withheld model kept the supporting investments on AIG's balance sheet, creating a payable to Fortitude Re while establishing a reinsurance asset for the assumed coverage. This reflects a strategic evolution in how AIG managed capital pressures under regulatory risk transfer requirements, shifting toward more structured, long-term reinsurance arrangements that align with compliance and financial flexibility goals.",

For additional information, see Note 1.\n\n## SHORT-DURATION REINSURANCE\n\nShort-duration reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts that protect us against losses above stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are recognized as a reduction of premiums earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on short-duration contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of Reinsurance assets. Reinsurance premiums for assumed business are estimated based on information received from brokers, ceding companies and reinsurers. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the periods in which they are determined. Assumed reinsurance premiums are earned primarily on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the reinsurance contracts and the portion of premiums relating to the unexpired terms of coverage is included in the reserve for unearned premiums. Reinsurance premiums for assumed business are estimated based on information received from brokers, ceding companies and reinsureds. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the periods in which they are determined. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met for reinsurance accounting to apply. If risk transfer requirements are not met, the contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. Similar risk transfer criteria are used to determine whether directly written insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or as a deposit.",

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express identified operational risk as a key exposure, particularly tied to fraud, theft, and cyberattacks, which could result from inadequate systems or third-party mismanagement. This risk was further defined in 2024, where fraud was explicitly called out as a growing threat, especially due to increased targeting by bad actors and reliance on third parties with inconsistent compliance practices. Between these years, AXP faced rising regulatory scrutiny and operational complexity, leading to a strategic shift toward enhanced third-party oversight, improved data governance, and stronger cybersecurity controls to mitigate fraud risk. The evolution from general operational risk awareness in 2022 to targeted fraud risk mitigation in 2024 reflects a direct response to the increasing frequency and sophistication of fraud incidents.",

        "Hop 3: Fraud \u2190 AXP(2024): In 2024, AXP emphasized increased exposure to fraud due to bad actors and third-party risks, prompting stronger governance and compliance measures."

Our failure to comply with such laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security in the United States, the EU and various other countries in which we operate.\n\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see 'Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security' under 'Supervision and Regulation.'\n\n## We may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\n\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party's compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third parties. As processes or organizations are changed, or new products and services are introduced, such as new lending features, debit products and checking accounts, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm to customers, legal liability, fines, sanctions, customer remediation and brand damage.\n\nCompliance risk arises from violations of, or failure to conform or comply with, laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and ethical standards. We need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks. Operational and compliance failures, deficiencies in our control environment or an inability to maintain an ethical workplace and high standards of business conduct can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations.\n\n## If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our products, systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages.\n\n## Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\n\nNew tax legislative initiatives, including increases in the corporate tax rate, are currently being considered and may be enacted. In addition, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) could have an impact on how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits. These potential changes could adversely impact our effective tax rate, our tax positions and tax liabilities. In addition, actions by tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities.",

Third parties may also act in other ways that are inconsistent with our interests or contrary to our strategic or technological initiatives, such as ceasing to provide data to us or using our data in a way that was not authorized or diminishes the value of the transaction data we receive through our integrated payments platform.\n\nThe management and oversight of an increasing number of third parties increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control. Additionally, third-party oversight and practices related to third parties such as outsourcing have become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny both in the United States and internationally, including in some cases restricting or requiring approval for outsourcing. A failure to ex ercise adequate oversight over third parties, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in regulatory actions, fines, litigation, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our third-party providers' service providers. We are also ex posed to the risk that a service disruption at a service provider common to our third parties could impede their ability to provide services to us. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties, in certain cases there may be limited alternatives or high costs for diversification, and we also may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to the service providers of our third-party providers.\n\n## Our success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect and upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and misconduct by or loss of personnel could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely upon our colleagues not only for business success, but also to act with integrity and promote a culture of respect. To the extent our colleagues behave in a manner that does not comport with our company's values, the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe market for qualified, highly motivated individuals with diverse perspectives is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain such individuals. The unexpected loss of key personnel could disrupt our business and have an adverse impact on our future performance. Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations or other changes in the legal or regulatory environment can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to employ colleagues in the location(s) of our choice. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB are subject to review and oversight by the OCC. This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our ex ecutive officers and other key personnel. Our inability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled, motivated and diverse personnel could materially adversely affect our business and our culture.\n\n## Regulation in the areas of privacy, data protection, data management, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access, artificial intelligence and machine learning and information security and cybersecurity could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\n\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection, data management, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access, artificial intelligence and machine learning and information security and cybersecurity laws, including data localization, authentication and notification laws. As such laws are interpreted and applied (in some cases, with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions), compliance and technology costs will continue to increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate privacy, data protection, data management, incident management, resiliency, third party management, data transfer, security controls, account access mechanisms and controls related to artificial intelligence and machine learning are in place. Additionally, new laws and regulations related to automated decision making, artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as the application of ex isting laws and regulations to these technologies may restrict or impose burdensome and costly requirements on our ability to use them or impact other aspects of our business.\n\nCompliance with current or future laws in the aforementioned areas could significantly impact our business operations, including our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our integrated payments platform or provide certain products and services or work with certain service providers, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with such laws or to maintain sufficient governance and control structures could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data management, artificial intelligence and machine learning and information security and cybersecurity in the United States, the EU and various other countries in which we operate and our data protection and governance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny.\n\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see 'Supervision and Regulation - Privacy, Data Protection, Data Management, Artificial Intelligence, Resiliency, Information Security and Cybersecurity' under 'Business.'\n\n## If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information.

      "question": "How did the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act's derivatives market regulations influence AIG's compliance strategy and risk exposure between 2022 and 2024, particularly in light of the increased regulatory reporting and margin requirements introduced under Title VII?",
      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, AIG's exposure to derivatives market regulation intensified due to the continued enforcement of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, which mandated increased regulatory reporting for swaps, required central clearing for certain transactions, and imposed margin and collateral requirements. In 2022, AIG's 10-K filing emphasized the company's ongoing efforts to comply with a complex and evolving regulatory environment, including potential costs and operational burdens associated with regulatory changes. By 2024, AIG was formally subject to the Group Capital Calculation (GCC) requirement under New York State law, which was incorporated into U.S. insurance regulation as part of broader Dodd-Frank-related reforms. This requirement, effective from 2024, added a new layer of consolidated capital oversight, directly linking Dodd-Frank\u2019s regulatory framework to AIG's derivatives risk exposure and capital planning processes. The evolution of these regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act required AIG to adapt its compliance strategy, particularly in areas of derivatives reporting and margin management, reflecting a shift from general regulatory preparedness in 2022 to operational implementation by 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG(2022) \u2192 Dodd-Frank Act: AIG acknowledged the regulatory burden of Dodd-Frank, including potential costs and compliance challenges, particularly in the context of evolving industry practices and regulatory expectations.",
        "Hop 2: Dodd-Frank Act \u2192 Derivatives Market Regulation: Title VII of Dodd-Frank significantly increased regulation of derivatives markets, including mandatory reporting, clearing, and margin requirements, which directly impacted financial institutions like AIG.",
        "Hop 3: Derivatives Market Regulation \u2190 AIG(2024): By 2024, AIG was subject to the GCC requirement, a Dodd-Frank-related reform that introduced consolidated capital oversight, directly affecting how AIG managed derivatives risk and capital planning."

The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services or could limit our ability to offer certain product features. Consequently, we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon their intellectual property rights, including patent rights, or violate license usage rights. Any such intellectual property claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages, and in some circumstances we could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers, or utilizing and benefiting from certain patent, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nOur businesses are heavily regulated and changes in laws and regulations may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability. Our operations generally, and our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries in particular, are subject to extensive and potentially conflicting laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our business and financial condition are also subject to supervision and regulation by authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Federal, state and foreign regulators also periodically review and investigate our insurance and reinsurance businesses, including AIG-specific and industry-wide practices. The primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of our insurance and reinsurance contract holders. The extent of regulation on our insurance and reinsurance business varies across the jurisdictions where we operate, but generally is governed by laws that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to insurance departments and similar regulatory agencies. The laws and regulations that apply to our business and operations generally grant regulatory agencies and/or self-regulatory organizations broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to regulate the issuance, sale and distribution of our products, the manner in which we underwrite our policies, the delivery of our services, the nature or extent of disclosures that we give our customers, the compensation of our distribution partners, the manner in which we handle claims on our policies and the administration of our policies and contracts, as well as the power to limit or restrict our business for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our Life and Retirement companies and their distributors are also subject to laws and regulations governing the standard of care applicable to sales of our products, the provision of advice to our customers and the manner in which certain conflicts of interest arising from or related to such sales or giving of advice are to be addressed. In addition, federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to certain of our insurance products that are considered 'securities' under such laws, including our variable annuity contracts, variable life insurance policies and the separate accounts that issue them, as well as our broker-dealer, investment advisor and mutual fund operations.\n\nFor additional information on the regulatory regimes we are subject to, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the standard of care-related regulations administered by the DOL, see Item 1. Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulation.\n\nSignificant legislative and regulatory activity has occurred at both the U.S. federal and state levels, as well as globally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on insurance consumers. While some of these legislative and regulatory initiatives have expired, any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus may lead to a renewal of those initiatives. We cannot predict what form future legal and regulatory responses to concerns about COVID-19 and related public health issues will take, or how such responses will impact our business.\n\nWe strive to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, operations and legal entities, including maintenance of all required licenses and approvals. The application of and compliance with such laws and regulations may be subject to interpretation, evolving industry practices and regulatory expectations that could result in increased compliance costs. The relevant authorities may not agree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations, including, for example, our implementation of new or revised requirements related to capital, accounting treatment or reserving such as those governing PBR, or with our policies and procedures adopted to address evolving industry practices or meet regulatory expectations. Such authorities' interpretations and views may also change from time to time. It is also possible that the laws, regulations and interpretations across various jurisdictions in which we do business may conflict with one another and affect how we do business in the United States and globally. If we are found not to have complied with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 45",

These GCC provisions were incorporated in New York State laws in August 2023, making AIG formally subject to the GCC beginning in 2024.

While not serving a regulatory function, FIO performs certain duties related to the business of insurance and has authority to collect information on the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. In addition, FIO monitors market access issues, represents the United States in international insurance forums and has authority to determine if certain regulations are preempted by covered agreements. FIO's approval is required to subject a financial company whose largest U.S. subsidiary is an insurer to the special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the FDIC pursuant to Dodd-Frank. U.S. insurance subsidiaries of any such financial company, however, would remain subject to rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings under state insurance laws.\n\nFIO also assists the Secretary of the Treasury in administering the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance A ct (TRIA ), enacted in 2002 to support insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the U.S. The program was continued under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct of 2019 (TRIPRA ) through December 31, 2027 and is intended to provide reinsurance coverage from the federal government in limited circumstances for certified acts of terrorism that exceed a certain threshold of industry losses.\n\nTitle I of Dodd-Frank established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), which is authorized to determine that certain nonbank financial companies be designated as nonbank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and enhanced prudential standards. Designation by the Council of any nonbank SIFI is subject to certain statutory and regulatory standards and to the Council's guidance. The Council may also recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that insurers or other nonbank financial services companies engage in.\n\nTitle V  of Dodd-Frank authorizes the United States to enter into covered agreements with foreign governments or regulatory entities regarding the business of insurance and reinsurance. On September 22, 2017, the U.S. and the European Union (EU) entered into such an agreement, and on December 18, 2018, the U.S. signed a covered agreement with the United Kingdom (UK), which is similar to the agreement with the EU. Under the agreements, A IG is subject to consolidated group supervision by its relevant U.S. insurance supervisors only, and generally does not have to satisfy EU Solvency II capital, reporting and governance requirements at the consolidated group level. The covered agreements also required various U.S. reinsurance collateral reforms, which were adopted by all U.S. states.\n\nTitle V II of Dodd-Frank provides for significantly  increased regulation of, and restrictions on, derivativ es markets and transactions that have affected various activities of insurance and other financial services companies, including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps, including security-based swaps, (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated swap execution facilities for certain swaps (other than security-based swaps) and (iii) margin and collateral requirements.\n\n## International\n\nIn the UK, the Prudential Regulation A uthority (PRA ) is the lead prudential supervisor for our UK insurance operations and the Financial Conduct A uthority has oversight of A IG's insurance operations for consumer protection and competition matters.

      "question": "How did the changes in Class B and Class A Common Stock share counts from 2023 to 2024 impact the voting power distribution and corporate governance structure at V?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Class B Common Stock had limited voting rights, primarily for specific corporate actions like mergers or exiting the core payments business, with each share carrying a weighted vote based on the conversion rate. Class A Common Stockholders held broader voting rights across all matters (V_10k_2023.pdf). By 2024, the number of Class A Common Stock shares increased from 1,594 to 1,733, while Class B shares dropped significantly from 245 to 125 (V_10k_2024.pdf). This shift likely diluted the relative voting influence of Class B holders, who previously held a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, while increasing the proportional influence of Class A holders. The Class B to Class A relationship, where Class B shares carry 15 votes per share, implies that the reduction in Class B shares directly reduced the concentrated voting bloc (CMCSA_10k_2023.pdf). This evolution in share structure suggests a move toward more distributed shareholder influence, with implications for corporate governance decisions requiring stockholder approval.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: V(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: V's 2023 governance structure limited Class B voting rights to specific corporate actions, with each share's vote weighted by conversion rate.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class B shares carried 15 votes per share, representing 33 1/3% of combined voting power, while Class A shares held the remaining 66 2/3%.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 V(2024): By 2024, Class A shares increased to 1,733 while Class B shares dropped to 125, shifting the voting power balance toward Class A holders."

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife's Retirement and Income Solutions segment included Benefit Funding Solutions as part of its broader portfolio of pension risk transfers and structured settlements. By 2024, Benefit Funding Solutions had evolved into a more specialized offering, explicitly designed to fund postretirement benefits and nonqualified benefit programs for executives, indicating a strategic sharpening of focus. This evolution suggests that MetLife enhanced the customization and targeting of these products to meet specific corporate funding needs, aligning them more closely with executive compensation and postretirement planning. The 2024 evidence highlights a more defined positioning of Benefit Funding Solutions within the broader risk solutions framework, signaling a deliberate expansion into tailored corporate insurance funding strategies.",

Our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments are excluded given  their  limited  U.S.  interest  rate  sensitivity.  For  additional  information  regarding  account  values  subject  to  minimum crediting rate guarantees, the maturity profile of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale ('AFS'), and the yield on invested assets, see '- Investments;' '- Policyholder Liabilities - Policyholder Account Balances;' and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## U.S.\n\n## Group Benefits\n\nDeclining  Interest  Rate  Scenario. Our  group  life  insurance  products  are  primarily  renewable  term  policies.  This provides repricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\n\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. All of these  accounts  are  at  their  minimum  crediting  rates.  Additionally,  we  experience  gross  margin  compression  from  our disability policy claim reserves for which crediting rates cannot be reduced. We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression for both products.\n\nGross margin compression is limited for our group disability products, which are generally renewable term policies allowing for crediting rate adjustments at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and the prevailing interest rate assumptions.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario. We reinvest our cash flows from our group insurance products in higher yielding assets, mitigating the impact of (i) higher interest crediting rates on, primarily, our retained asset accounts, and (ii) lower income from our derivative positions used to mitigate low interest rate margin compression.\n\n## Retirement and Income Solutions\n\nThis  business  contains  both  short-  and  long-duration  products  consisting  of  capital  market  products,  pension  risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products.\n\nThe  two  hypothetical  interest  rate  scenarios  do  not  assume  any  additional ALM  actions  we  may  take  to  preserve margins.",

Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment  reporting,  adjusted  earnings  is  also  the  Company's  GAAP  measure  of  segment  performance  and  is  reported  below. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). The Company believes the presentation of adjusted earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\n\nAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax.",

      "answer": "In 2023, BAC reported that embedded derivatives in structured liabilities led to net gains (losses) in market-making activities, which were typically offset by gains (losses) on derivatives and securities used for hedging. These embedded derivatives were linked to structured instruments like CDOs, as noted in the 2024 evidence from another firm's filing, which described CDOs as hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives. By 2024, BAC's maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs had decreased from $80 million (2023) to $65 million (2024), indicating a reduction in risk exposure. This suggests that BAC may have adjusted its structuring and hedging strategies involving CDOs and embedded derivatives to better manage credit and market risk.",

There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 202 4, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs\n\nThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by  issuing  multiple  tranches  of  debt  and  equity  securities.  CDOs  are  generally managed  by  third-party  portfolio  managers.  The  Corporation  typically  transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation's maximum  loss exposure to consolidated  and  unconsolidated  CDOs  totaled  $65  million  and  $80  million  at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Investment VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  sponsors,  invests  in  or  provides  financing,  which  may  be  in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real  estate,  d eb t  securities  or  oth er  financial  instruments  and   are  d esigned   to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At December 31,  202 4  and  2023,  the  Corporation's  consolidated  investment  VIEs  had  total assets of $6 million and $472\n\nmillion.  The  Corporation  also  h eld   investments  in  unconsolidated  VIEs  with  total assets of $23.0 billion and $18.4 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. The Corporation's  maximum  loss  exposure  associated  with  both  consolidated  and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31,  202 4  and  2023  comprised  primarily  of  on-balance  sheet  assets  less  nonrecourse liabilities.\n\n## Leveraged Lease Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation's  net  investment  in  consolidated  leveraged  lease  trusts  totaled $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. The trusts hold longlived  equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and  commercial  aircraft.  The  Corporation  structures  the  trusts  and  holds  a significant  residual  interest.  The  net  investment  represents  the  Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is nonrecourse to the Corporation.\n\nThe table below summarizes the maximum loss exposure and assets held by the Corporation  that  related  to  oth er  asset-backed  VIEs  at  December  3 1,  202 4  and 2023.\n\n## Other Asset-backed VIEs\n\n",

      "question": "How did the treatment and presentation of Separate Account Assets and Liabilities in BlackRock's consolidated financial statements evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of their exclusion from the adjusted statement of financial condition?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BlackRock disclosed that Separate Account Assets were maintained by BlackRock Life Limited and represented segregated assets held for pension contracts, with equal and offsetting Separate Account Liabilities recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These assets and liabilities were not subject to general claims of BlackRock\u2019s creditors. By 2024, BlackRock explicitly excluded Separate Account Assets and Liabilities (along with related securities lending collateral) from its adjusted statement of financial condition, noting that these items have equal and offsetting liabilities or non-controlling interests and do not impact stockholders' equity or cash flows. This shift in presentation reflects a more refined approach to isolating economically irrelevant items for investor clarity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [BLK](2023) \u2192 [Separate Account Assets]: In 2023, BLK disclosed Separate Account Assets held by BlackRock Life Limited, which were segregated for pension contracts and not subject to general creditor claims.",
        "Hop 2: [Separate Account Assets] \u2192 [Separate Account Liabilities]: These assets were directly tied to Separate Account Liabilities, which represented the contract holders\u2019 account balances and were equal and offsetting.",
        "Hop 3: [Separate Account Liabilities] \u2190 [BLK](2024): In 2024, BLK excluded both Separate Account Assets and Liabilities from its adjusted statement of financial condition, emphasizing their offsetting nature and lack of economic impact on equity or cash flows."

          "chunk_text": "The Organisation for E conom ic C ooperation and D evelopm ent ('O E C D ') has proposed certain international tax reform s, which, am ong other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consum er ('P illar O ne') and (2) establish a global m inim um  tax for m ultinational com panies of 15% ('P illar T wo'). I n response, E uropean U nion m em ber states and several other countries, including the U nited Kingdom , have since adopted laws im plem enting the O E C D 's m inim um  tax rules under P illar T wo, effective starting in 2024. As a result of these developm ents, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackR ock does business have changed and m ay continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. T he P illar T wo F ram ework did not have a m aterial im pact on BlackR ock's consolidated financial statem ents for 2024 and the C om pany is continuing to m onitor legislative developm ents and evaluate the potential im pact of the P illar T wo F ram ework on future periods.\n\n## 2023 I ncom e tax expense (G AAP ) reflected:\n\n\u00b7 a discrete tax benefit of $201 m illion, related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax m atters; and\n\n\u00b7 a discrete tax benefit of $41 m illion, related to stock-based com pensation awards that vested in 2023.\n\n## STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVE RVIE W\n\n## As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statem ent of financial condition presented on a G AAP  basis to the consolidated statem ent of financial condition, excluding the im pact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreem ents (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreem ents and C IP s.\n\nThe Com pany presents the as adjusted statem ent of financial condition as additional inform ation to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or N C I  that ultim ately do not have an im pact on stockholders' equity or cash flows. M anagem ent views the as adjusted statem ent of financial condition, which contains non-G AAP financial m easures, as an econom ic presentation of the C om pany's total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-G AAP  financial measures in isolation from , or as a substitute for, financial inform ation prepared in accordance with G AAP .\n\nSeparate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements\n\nSeparate account assets are m aintained by BlackR ock Life Lim ited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the C om pany that is a registered life insurance com pany in the U K, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The C om pany records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities.

By 2023, Class B Common Stockholders gained the right to vote on the approval of certain amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation, where they would vote as a separate class alongside Class A and C common stockholders if such amendments affect the terms of Class B or C common stock.

The shares of series B and C preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of series B and C preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the series B and C preferred stock  (whether  by  such  12th  anniversary,  or  thereafter  with  respect  to  claims  pending  on  such  anniversary),  the conversion rate would be adjusted downward and the holder would receive either class A common stock or series A preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company's charter). The conversion rates may also be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities.\n\nThe series A preferred stock, generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company's class A common stock, is freely transferable and each share of series A preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.\n\nVoting rights. The holders of the series B and C preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain  defined  matters,  including,  in  specified  circumstances,  any  consolidation,  merger,  combination  or  similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences,  rights  and  privileges  of  the  applicable  series  of  preferred  stock  or  (ii)  receive  securities,  cash  or  other property that is different from what the Company's class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the series B and C preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the series A preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the series B and C preferred stock.\n\nClass A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will  vote  together  with  the  class A  common  stockholders  in  a  single  class,  and  (ii)  in  specified  circumstances,  any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class. In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Holders of the Company's common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certificate of incorporation that relates solely to any series of preferred stock.",

Fair Value (continued)\n\n(5) Investment performance related to separate account assets is fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected within separate account liabilities. Separate account liabilities are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets. Separate account liabilities presented in the tables above represent derivative liabilities.\n\n(6) Total assets included in the fair value hierarchy ex clude OLPI that are measured at estimated fair value using the net asset value ('NAV ') per share (or its equivalent) practical ex pedient. The estimated fair value of such investments was $50 million and $52 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n(7) Embedded derivatives within liability host contracts are presented within PABs and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe following describes the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.\n\n## Investments\n\n## Securities, Short-term Investments and Other Investments\n\nWhen available, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company's securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management's judgment.\n\nWhen quoted prices in active markets are not available, the determination of estimated fair value of securities is based on market standard valuation methodologies, giving priority to observable inputs. The significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. When observable inputs are not available, the market standard valuation methodologies rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be  derived  principally  from,  or  corroborated  by,  observable  market  data.  These  unobservable  inputs  can  be  based,  in  large  part,  on  management's  judgment  or estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market activity. Unobservable inputs are based on management's assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing such investments.\n\nThe estimated fair value of short-term investments and other investments is determined on a basis consistent with the methodologies described herein.\n\nThe valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are presented below. The primary valuation approaches are the market approach, which considers recent prices from market transactions involving identical or similar assets or  liabilities,  and  the  income  approach,  which  converts  ex pected  future  amounts  (e.g.,  cash  flows)  to  a  single  current,  discounted  amount.  The  valuation  of  most instruments listed below is determined using independent pricing sources, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow methodologies or other similar techniques that use either observable market inputs or unobservable inputs.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Schwab's integration of TD Ameritrade led to increased operational complexity and regulatory scrutiny, which required the company to align TD Ameritrade's risk management practices with Schwab\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework. This integration also resulted in higher capital expenditures and amortization costs to support technological infrastructure, which affected capital allocation. By 2024, Schwab's broker-dealer subsidiary, CS&Co, remained in compliance with the Uniform Net Capital Rule, indicating that despite the integration-driven changes in 2023, Schwab successfully maintained sufficient capital buffers to meet regulatory thresholds. This demonstrates that the integration did not compromise Schwab\u2019s ability to comply with net capital requirements, even as it absorbed the financial and operational impacts of the merger.",

They have and may continue to cause illnesses and deaths, changes in consumer or business  confidence,  behavior  and  activity,  changes  to  interest  rates  and  other  market  risk  factors,  and  governmental  or  other restrictions on economic activity for prolonged periods. Any of these issues may cause or exacerbate any of the difficult economic conditions we describe in these risk factors.\n\n## Interest Rate Risks\n\nSome of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\n\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or sustained low market returns, we may incur significant losses due to, among other  reasons,  losses  incurred  in  our  general  account  and  the  impact  of  guarantees,  including  increases  in  liabilities,  capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative.\n\nLower spreads may accelerate the amortization of DAC, reducing net income and in turn, harming our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. During periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\n\nInterest rate increases may also harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived  returns.  This  may  result  in  cash  outflows  requiring  the  sale  of  investments  on  less  favorable  terms,  resulting  in investment losses. We may accelerate the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired ('VOBA'), reducing net income, harming our credit  instrument  covenants  and  rating  agency  assessment  of  our  financial  condition.  Interest  rate  increases  may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity  needs.  Furthermore,  if  interest  rates  rise,  our  unrealized  gains  on  fixed  income  securities  may  decrease  and  our unrealized  losses  may  increase.  We  would  recognize  the  accumulated  change  in  estimated  fair  value  of  these  fixed  income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security or we determine that the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\n\nFederal Reserve Board monetary policy (and that of other central banks) may also impact the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may harm our investment income or product sales.\n\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may  not  be  able  to  invest  assets  at  the  full  liability  duration,  thereby  creating  some  asset/liability  mismatch.  In  addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders' equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.",

      "question": "How did the decline in MET's Reinvestment Portfolio value tied to Securities Lending from 2023 to 2024 affect the company's liquidity risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MET reported a Reinvestment Portfolio value of $10,553 million tied to its Securities Lending agreements. By 2024, this value had decreased compared to the prior year, reflecting a potential reduction in the company's ability to reinvest collateral received from these agreements. This decline is linked to MET's 2024 disclosures, where the company highlighted increased liquidity risks associated with securities lending, specifically noting the potential need to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice and the impact of market volatility on its ability to maintain these agreements. The reduced portfolio value likely contributed to MET\u2019s heightened concern around liquidity constraints, especially in scenarios involving rapid collateral calls or disruptions in financial markets. This evolution in the Reinvestment Portfolio\u2019s value and its implications on liquidity management directly ties the 2023 portfolio level to the 2024 risk disclosures.",

        "Hop 1: MET(2023) \u2192 Reinvestment Portfolio: MET disclosed a Reinvestment Portfolio value of $10,553 million linked to Securities Lending agreements in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Reinvestment Portfolio \u2192 Securities Lending: The Reinvestment Portfolio is directly tied to Securities Lending, as MET reinvests cash collateral received from counterparties under these agreements.",
        "Hop 3: Securities Lending \u2190 MET(2024): In 2024, MET highlighted liquidity risks tied to Securities Lending, including the potential need to return large amounts of collateral and the impact of market volatility on its ability to fund operations."

The value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by such threats. Companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions, and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. Terrorist or military actions also could disrupt our operations centers and result in higher than anticipated claims under our insurance policies.\n\n## We May Not Meet Our Liquidity Needs, Access Capital, or May Face Significantly Increased Cost of Capital Due to Adverse Capital and Credit Market Conditions\n\nIn cases of volatility, disruption, or other conditions in global financial markets, we may have to seek additional financing, the availability and cost of which could be adversely affected by market conditions, regulatory considerations, availability of credit to our industry generally, our credit ratings and credit capacity, reduced business activity, or investment losses, and the perception of our financial prospects. Our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. We may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing we need on favorable terms or at all. We may be required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending or derivatives agreements or post collateral or make payments related to specified counterparty agreements.\n\nOur  business  and  financial  results  may  suffer  without  sufficient  liquidity  through  impaired  ability  to  pay  claims,  other  operating  ex penses,  interest  on  our  debt, dividends  on  our  capital  stock,  cash  or  collateral  to  our  subsidiaries,  maintain  our  securities  lending,  replace  certain  maturing  liabilities,  sustain  our  operations  and investments, and repurchase our common stock. Capital and credit market volatility may limit our access to capital we need to operate or grow our business, issue the types of securities we would prefer, timely replace maturing liabilities, or satisfy regulatory requirements, any of which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flex ibility.\n\n## We May Be Unable to Access Our Credit Facility, Reducing Our Liquidity and Leading to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings\n\nWe may fail to comply with or fulfill all conditions under the unsecured revolving credit facility (the 'Credit Facility') MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc. maintain. Lenders may fail to fund their lending commitments under the Credit Facility due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons.\n\n## We May Lose Business Due to a Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings\n\nNationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ('NRSROs') and others may, at any time, downgrade our financial strength ratings or credit ratings, lower our ratings outlooks, increase the scope or frequency of their reviews, or increase capital or other requirements to maintain ratings. Such changes could reduce our product sales, reduce cash flows from funding agreements and other capital market products, and force us to change product pricing and increase our financing costs, policy surrenders or withdrawals, collateral requirements, risk of derivative terminations, cost of reinsurance, regulatory scrutiny, or various other factors.\n\n## We May Not Find Available, Affordable or Adequate Reinsurance to Protect Us Against Losses\n\nReinsurers may increase our reinsurance costs, or may decline to offer us reinsurance, due to policy changes related to public health issues, market conditions, or other factors. Our risk of loss may increase if we decrease the amount of our reinsurance. Any of these could harm our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue.\n\nWe remain liable and may incur costs as the direct insurer on all risks we reinsure as a result of a reinsurer's insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments, or inability or unwillingness to maintain collateral, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings Costs May Increase, and We May Find Limited Market Capacity for New Financings\n\nIf MetLife's ratings decline, market capacity is limited, or on other repricing occasions, our costs to finance statutory life insurance reserves may increase. If regulators disallow assets to back statutory reserves, we would not be able to take some or all related statutory reserve credit, which may harm the statutory capitalization of certain of our insurance subsidiaries.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife's EMEA segment contributed only $265M to the company's total earnings of $5,525M, indicating a relatively minor role in the overall financial performance. However, the EMEA segment was explicitly noted as offering Accident & Health Insurance, among other products. By 2024, Accident & Health Insurance premiums increased from $18.014B to $18.356B, showing continued growth in this product line despite EMEA's smaller earnings contribution. This suggests that Accident & Health Insurance remained a strategically important product category for MetLife, even in regions like EMEA that contribute less to overall earnings, possibly due to market-specific demand or long-term growth potential.",

      "answer": "AIG's $82 million amortization of the deferred gain from the 2017 retroactive reinsurance agreement with NICO in 2023 demonstrates that the transaction remains an active component of AIG's long-term risk management strategy (2023 evidence). This reinsurance agreement, backed by a parental guarantee from Berkshire Hathaway, was structured to transfer 80% of the reserve risk on AIG's U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior (2024 evidence). The continued presence of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s guarantee into 2024, as evidenced by the referenced agreement and its inclusion in filings for that year, ensures that AIG can continue amortizing the gain and benefiting from the risk transfer, reinforcing the stability and long-term financial planning enabled by the guarantee (2024 evidence).",

Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under GA A P retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO's obligations under the agreement.\n\nFor a description of AIG's catastrophe reinsurance protection for 2024, see Part II, Item 7. M D&amp;A - Enterprise Risk M anagement - Insurance Risks - Natural Catastrophe Risk.\n\nThe table below shows the calculation of the deferred gain on the adverse development reinsurance agreement, the effect of discounting of loss reserves and amortization of the deferred gain.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the implementation timeline of the UK's Overseas Fund Regime (OFR), which required EU consumer protection regimes to be deemed equivalent to the UK's in order to market funds there, affect BlackRock's fund distribution strategy in 2024, especially given the firm's continued operations under the UK's evolving conduct regulations such as the Consumer Duty rules introduced in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the OFR was described as a regime requiring consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK's in order to market such funds in the UK, with full implementation expected through 2024. By 2024, the UK had issued final policies regulating services provided by third parties designated as 'critical' to the financial sector, which became effective in January 2025, and the FCA continued to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty rules. These developments constrained BlackRock\u2019s fund distribution strategy in the UK, as the firm had to ensure that its EU-based funds met the FCA\u2019s equivalence standards while simultaneously complying with new conduct expectations such as price and value assessments, consumer understanding, and support requirements under Consumer Duty. This dual regulatory layer increased operational complexity and compliance costs for BlackRock\u2019s UK subsidiaries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BLK(2023) \u2192 OFR: In 2023, BlackRock was subject to the OFR, which required EU fund regimes to be equivalent to the UK\u2019s for market access, with implementation continuing through 2024.",
        "Hop 2: OFR \u2192 UK: The UK enacted and continued to implement the OFR, which governed how non-UK funds could access the UK retail market through FCA equivalence determinations.",
        "Hop 3: UK \u2190 BLK(2024): In 2024, BlackRock operated under the UK\u2019s evolving regulatory environment, including the Consumer Duty rules and final policies on critical third-party oversight, which directly impacted its UK subsidiaries\u2019 conduct and compliance obligations."

F or exam ple, the SE C  adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports, adopted final am endm ents to the rule governing fund nam es, expanding the scope of the rule to fund nam es including growth, value, E SG  or sim ilar term s, and proposed rules governing outsourcing of certain functions by investm ent advisers to service providers.\n\n## INTE R N ATIO N AL R E G U LATO R Y R E F O R M\n\n## Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms\n\nThe E U 's D igital O perational R esilience Act ('D O R A'), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, becam e applicable beginning in January 2025. D OR A, am ong other things: (1) introduces additional governance, risk m anagem ent, incident reporting, resilience testing and inform ation sharing requirem ents to several of BlackR ock's E uropean entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) m ay potentially subject Aladdin to additional oversight. T he E uropean Supervisory Authorities will use data collected under D O R A to assess which third party suppliers should be designated as critical to the E U  financial system  and becom e subject to further regulatory oversight. In 2024, the U K issued final policies regulating services provided by certain third parties designated by H M T  as 'critical' to the financial sector, which becam e effective in January 2025. Entities designated as 'critical' will be required to provide additional inform ation to financial regulators, engage in resilience testing and report m ajor incidents like cyber-attacks, natural disasters and power outages.\n\n## Retail Investment Strategy\n\nThe E U  continues to consider a proposed R etail Investm ent Strategy package of am endm ents intended to enhance protections for retail investors. W hen enacted, these changes could im pact clients' product preferences and m ay increase costs for BlackR ock in E uropean m arkets due to additional requirem ents on distributors and product providers.\n\n## EMIR 3.0\n\nThe E U  legislative package known as 'E M IR  3.0' introduces key changes to clearing, m argining and reporting requirem ents in the E uropean M arket Infrastructure R egulation (E M IR ), including: (1) a requirem ent to hold an 'active account' with an E U  central counterparty for clearing certain euro-denom inated instrum ents; (2) new reporting requirem ents for cleared trades; (3) revised clearing thresholds for financial and non-financial counterparties; and (4) am endm ents related to clearing to the U C IT S directive. E M IR  3.0 is expected to im pact E U counterparties as well as U K and non-E U  entities trading with E U  firm s, and the collective im pact of the package m ay increase operational com plexity, necessitate a reassessm ent of clearing and trading strategies, and lead to higher transaction costs for BlackR ock and its clients.\n\n## FSMA 2023\n\nThe Financial Services and M arkets Act 2023 ('FSM A') reflects significant changes to the U K fram ework for financial services regulation, including changes that: (1) revoke, am end or retain E U  law on financial services regulation, (2) am end the U K M arkets in F inancial I nstrum ents D irective and M arkets in F inancial I nstrum ents R egulation fram eworks, (3) establish a new designated activities regim e and (4) reform  the financial prom otion regim e for unauthorized firm s. O ther reform s building upon the F SM A and potentially im pacting the asset managem ent sector include: (1) replacem ent of the packaged retail and insurance based investm ent products (\"P R IIP s\") R egulation; (2) review of the U K's green finance strategy, including regulation of E SG  data providers, U K taxonom y and disclosure requirem ents; (3) review of governance through the Senior M anagers and C ertification R egim e; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the E uropean Long-T erm  Investm ent F und; (5) m arket infrastructure reform s, including transition to T +1 settlem ent; (6) reassessm ent of the boundary between investm ent advice and financial guidance; (7) a new U K cryptoasset regim e; and (8) continuing reform s to the U K listing regim e.\n\n## Overseas Fund Regime ('OFR')\n\nOFR, the sim plified regim e through which non-U K funds can register with the F C A to be m arketed to U K retail investors, was enacted in F ebruary 2022 and continues to be im plem ented through 2025. F or certain types of funds, O F R  requires consum er protection regim es in E U  countries where such BlackR ock funds are dom iciled to be found equivalent to the U K's regim e in order to m arket the funds in the U K.\n\n## Conduct Regulation\n\nThe FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the im plem entation of the C onsum er D uty by all asset m anagem ent firm s, including BlackR ock's U K subsidiaries. T he Consum er D uty rules require firm s to act to deliver good outcom es for retail custom ers in their m anufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consum er understanding and consum er support. Any failure to m eet the FC A's regulatory expectations could expose BlackR ock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk.\n\n## UK Stewardship Code Review\n\nI n 2024, the U K F inancial R eporting C ouncil released a consultation on reform s to the U K Stewardship C ode, including tailored reporting requirem ents for proxy advisers and investm ent consultants, which m ay im pact BlackR ock's activities on behalf of its clients.\n\n## Regulatory E nvironment in China\n\nThe Com pany's operations in C hina are subject to a num ber of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environm ent and com plex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors m ay increase com pliance risk and costs, lim it the C om pany's ability to source and execute new investm ent opportunities and lead to im pairm ent losses on its investm ents. R estrictions on transfers of certain types of onshore data of the C om pany's C hinese entities to offshore entities also m ay lim it BlackR ock's ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform . In addition, a num ber of regulators in C hina have jurisdiction over BlackR ock's business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagem ent com plexity. These risks m ay be further heightened by additional scrutiny by C hinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that m ight be deem ed to be of national im portance.",

Any risk factor, either by itself or together with other risk factors, could materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.  References  to  third  parties  may  include  suppliers,  service  providers, counterparties,  financial  market  utilities,  exchanges  and  clearing  houses,  data aggregators  and  other  partners  and  their  upstream  and  downstream  service providers (e.g., fourth parties, fifth parties) who may also contribute to our risks. Other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also  adversely  affect  our  businesses,  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  and/or financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see Managing Risk in the MD&amp;A beginning on page 45. For more information about the  risks  contained  in  th is  section,  see  Item  1.  Business  b eginning  on  page  2, MD&amp;A  beginning  on  page  26  and  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements beginning on page 94.\n\n## Market\n\n## We  may be adversely affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and econom ic conditions.\n\nGeneral economic, political, social and health conditions in the U.S. and abroad affect financial markets and our businesses. In particular, global markets may be affected  by  the  level  and  volatility  of  interest  rates,  availability  and  market conditions  of  financing,  changes  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  economic growth or its sustainability , inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment  levels,  labor  shortages,  challenging  labor  market  conditions,  wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies and a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets. Global markets also may be affected by adverse developments impacting the U.S. or global banking industry , including bank failures, the failure of nonbank financial institutions and liq uid ity concerns, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital  markets  and  currencies,  the  transition  of  benchmark  rates  to  alternative reference rates, the impact of the volatility of digital assets on the broader market, the rate of growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure,  recessionary  fears,  investor  sentiment  and  the  U.S.  and  global election  cycles,  including  stated,  perceived  or  actual  changes  to  policy  and  the geopolitical environment. Global markets, including energy and  commodity markets, may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters, the  emergence  of  widespread  health  emergencies  or  pandemics,  cyberattacks, military conflicts, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and liquidity.\n\nAny sudden or prolonged market downturn, as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital  and  liquidity  levels.  Elevated   inflation  and   interest  rate  levels,  monetary tightening by central banks, and geopolitical developments, including the Russia/Ukraine  conflict  and  the  conflicts  in  the  Middle  East,  have  adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic  conditions,  as  well  as  result  in  additional  market  volatility  and disruptions and recessionary risk.\n\nGlobal uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. High and rising debt levels in the U.S. and globally may contribute to interest rate volatility , wh ich  may constrain governments' fiscal policies, potentially resulting in adverse economic outcomes. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve or central  banks  in  other  jurisdictions,  including  changes  in  target  rates,  balance sheet management and lending facilities, are beyond our control and difficult to predict, particularly regarding inflation, due to the uncertainty of inflationary paths. This  can  affect  interest  rates  and  th e  value  of  financial  instruments  and  oth er assets, such as debt securities, and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency  rates  and  may  also  raise  government  debt  levels,  adversely  affect businesses and household incomes, adversely impact the banking sector generally , and  increase  uncertainty  surrounding  monetary  policy .  Monetary  policy  has contributed to and may continue to result in elevated market interest rates and a flat  a nd / or  inv e rte d   yie ld   curv e .  A ny  incre a se s  in  p o licy  ra te s,  a s  a   re sp o nse   to inflation persistently above central bank targets, changes to fiscal or trade policies, or otherwise, could result in higher market interest rates. Elevated or rising interest rates may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets, and volatility of  th e  U .S.  d o lla r ,  w h ich   co uld   im p a ct  inv e sto r  risk  a p p e tite   a nd   o ur  b o rro w e rs, potentially  increasing  delinquency  rates.  Financial  market  volatility  could  also result from uncertainty about the timing and extent of any additional rate cuts by the  Federal  Reserve  in  response  to  moderating  inflation  and/or  weakening economic conditions. Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest rates would typically result in lower revenue through lower net interest income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nAlso, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy , climate ch ange (including efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely impact U.S. or global economic activity and our clients', our  counterparties'  and  our  earnings  and  operations.  Globally ,  although  many central  banks  have  begun  to  remove  monetary  restriction,  policy  rates  in  many countries remain at elevated levels. While higher interest rates have generally had a positive impact on our net interest income, they have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact investment securities, deposits, loan demand and funding  costs.  In  addition  to  higher  interest  rates,  wider  credit  spreads  can negatively impact capital and/or liquidity by reducing the value of debt securities. High  and  rising  federal  debt  levels,  investor  concerns  about  the  U.S.  fiscal trajectory , ch anges to fiscal policy and uncertainty about the U.S. budget process could lead to lower investor appetite for U.S. debt securities, higher interest rates and  financial  market  volatility ,  potentially  impacting  broader  economic  activity . Further,  if  th e  U .S.  government's  debt  ceiling  limit  is  not  raised  timely ,  th e ramifications may result in market volatility , ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy  responses  to  recessionary  conditions.  This  could  have  a  negative  and potentially severe impact on the U.S. and world economy and financial and capital markets, including higher interest rates, higher volatility , lower asset values, lower liq uid ity, d o w ngra d e s to  U .S. d e b t, a nd  a  w e a ke ne d  U .S. d o lla r.\n\nChanges  to  international  trade  and  investment  policies  by  the  U.S.  or  other countries,  and  the  uncertainty  about  potential  changes,  could  negatively  impact financial  markets  globally .

      "question": "How did the change in MetLife's repurchase agreements' reinvestment portfolio from $3,057 million in 2022 to $2,913 million in 2023 reflect the company's strategy adjustments in managing cash collateral received from counterpart?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported a reinvestment portfolio of $3,057 million under repurchase agreements, which decreased to $2,913 million in 2023. This decline aligns with a reduction in cash collateral received from counterparties, which fell from $3,125 million in 2022 to $2,975 million in 2023. The decrease in both metrics suggests a contraction in the scale of repurchase agreements, potentially indicating a more conservative approach to reinvestment or a strategic reallocation of capital. The reinvestment portfolio's drop of $144 million mirrors the $150 million decline in cash collateral, showing a proportional relationship between the collateral received and how MetLife chose to deploy those funds into its reinvestment portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: MET(2022) \u2192 Repurchase Agreements: MetLife's 2022 10-K shows that repurchase agreements were treated as financing arrangements, with cash received recorded as a liability and the associated reinvestment portfolio disclosed at $3,057 million.",

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nOther invested assets consist principally of the following:\n\n- Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in '- Derivatives' below.\n- Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax  credits  or  other  tax  incentives.  Where  tax  credits  are  guaranteed  by  a  creditworthy  third  party,  the  investment  is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 19.\n- Annuities funding structured settlement claims represent annuities funding claims assumed by the Company in its capacity as  a  structured  settlements  assignment  company.  The  annuities  are  stated  at  their  contract  value,  which  represents  the present  value  of  the  future  periodic  claim  payments  to  be  provided. The  net  investment  income  recognized  reflects  the amortization of discount of the annuity at its implied effective interest rate.\n- Direct financing leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value,  less  the  unearned  income,  less ACL.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the  pre-tax  internal  rate  of  return  to  the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation.\n- Leveraged leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less  the  unearned  income,  less  ACL  and  is  reported  net  of  non-recourse  debt.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the leveraged lease's estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease in those periods in which the net investment at the beginning of the period is positive. Leveraged leases derive investment returns in part from their income tax benefit. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments.\n- Investments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method.\n- Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ('FHLB') common stock are carried at redemption value and are considered restricted  investments  until  redeemed  by  the  respective  regional  FHLBs.  Dividends  are  recognized  in  net  investment income when declared.\n- Funds  withheld  represent  a  receivable  for  amounts  contractually  withheld  by  ceding  companies  in  accordance  with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions and Repurchase Agreements\n\nThe Company accounts for securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as financing arrangements and the associated  liability  is  recorded  at  the  amount  of  cash  received.  The  securities  loaned  or  sold  under  these  agreements  are included in invested assets. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements are recognized as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  securities  lending  transactions,  whereby  securities  are  loaned  to  unaffiliated  financial institutions. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan.",

      "answer": "In 2023, JPM disclosed a credit quality indicator methodology that involved assigning internal risk ratings to HTM securities, with 99% of these securities rated at least AA+. This approach was used to evaluate credit losses by applying statistical credit loss factors derived from macroeconomic forecasts. By 2024, this methodology had evolved into a more borrower-centric evaluation framework, where creditworthiness was assessed using factors such as loan-to-value ratios, property cash flow, and borrower credit profiles. The $128 million allowance for credit losses on investment securities in 2023 likely informed the firm's more proactive stance in 2024, where JPM explicitly reserved the right to reduce or cancel commitments in response to demonstrable declines in borrower creditworthiness or collateral value. This shows a clear progression from a security-level credit assessment to a more dynamic, borrower-focused risk management strategy.",

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees hav e historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's v iew, representativ e of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.\n\nTo prov ide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.\n\n302\n\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total av ailable credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all av ailable lines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to the extent otherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower or significant decrease in the v alue of underlying property.",

The shares of series B and C preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of series B and C preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the series B and C preferred stock  (whether  by  such  12th  anniversary,  or  thereafter  with  respect  to  claims  pending  on  such  anniversary),  the conversion rate would be adjusted downward and the holder would receive either class A common stock or series A preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company's charter). The conversion rates may also be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities.\n\nThe series A preferred stock, generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company's class A common stock, is freely transferable and each share of series A preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.\n\nVoting rights. The holders of the series B and C preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain  defined  matters,  including,  in  specified  circumstances,  any  consolidation,  merger,  combination  or  similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences,  rights  and  privileges  of  the  applicable  series  of  preferred  stock  or  (ii)  receive  securities,  cash  or  other property that is different from what the Company's class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the series B and C preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the series A preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the series B and C preferred stock.\n\nClass A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will  vote  together  with  the  class A  common  stockholders  in  a  single  class,  and  (ii)  in  specified  circumstances,  any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class. In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date.

      "answer": "In 2022, V had 245 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding, which converted at a rate of 1.6059 into 394 million as-converted Class A shares. By 2024, the number of Class B shares outstanding dropped significantly to 125 million, while Class A shares increased to 1,733 million. Despite the one-for-one conversion policy, the actual conversion rate in 2022 suggests a structural or historical adjustment. The reduction in Class B shares by 2024 indicates a shift in ownership structure, potentially driven by strategic decisions or market conditions affecting the holders of Class B stock.",

Entities eligible to hold Mastercard's Class B common stock are defined in the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation (generally the Company's principal or affiliate customers), and they are restricted from retaining ownership of shares of Class A common stock. Class B stockholders are required to subsequently sell or otherwise transfer any shares of Class A common stock received pursuant to such a conversion.\n\n## Mastercard Foundation\n\nIn connection and simultaneously with its 2006 initial public offering (the 'IPO'), the Company issued and donated 135 million newly authorized shares of Class A common stock to Mastercard Foundation. Mastercard Foundation is a private charitable foundation incorporated in Canada that is controlled by directors who are independent of the Company and its principal customers. Under the terms of the donation, Mastercard Foundation became able to resell the donated shares in May 2010 to the extent necessary to meet charitable disbursement requirements pursuant to Canadian tax law.

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab's acquisition of TD Ameritrade brought in $3.1 billion in total expenses from TDA, including significant operational costs related to its clearing services. By 2023, Schwab disclosed increased exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions, even if clients or counterparties failed to meet their obligations. This indicates that the integration of TD Ameritrade\u2019s clearing services expanded Schwab\u2019s counterparty credit risk profile in 2023 compared to 2022, as the operational scale and transaction volume grew post-acquisition.",

        "Hop 3: Clearing Services \u2190 SCHW(2023): In 2023, Schwab disclosed increased counterparty credit risk exposure due to its clearing obligations, indicating a direct impact from the integration of TD Ameritrade's services."

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.\n\nTotal expenses excluding interest increased $3.4 billion, or 46%, in 2021 from 2020, and $1.5 billion, or 26%, in 2020 from 2019. Total expenses excluding interest included amounts from TD Ameritrade of $3.1 billion in 2021 and $943 million in 2020 from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased $3.0 billion, or 44%, in 2021 from 2020 and $939 million, or 16%, in 2020 from 2019. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.\n\nTotal compensation and benefits increased in 2021 from 2020 due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade and growth in employee headcount. The 2021 increase reflected TDA's full-year contribution of $1.2 billion of compensation and benefits expense compared with $453 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was also due to additional headcount to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, a higher bonus accrual, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. Total compensation and benefits expense increased from 2020 to 2019, primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount related to our acquisitions of TDA and USAA-IMCO. The increase in 2020 from 2019 also reflected the Company's payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compensation and benefits included acquisition and integration-related costs of $283 million and $235 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nProfessional services expense increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's results of operations and overall growth in the business. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to acquisition and integration-related costs in 2020 of $158 million.\n\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due the inclusion of TDA's results of operations, costs related to the integration of TD Ameritrade, and overall growth in the business.

In the Advisor Services arena, we compete with institutional custodians, traditional and discount brokers, banks, and trust companies.\n\nAcross both segments, our key competitive advantages are:\n\n- Scale and Size of the Business - As one of the largest investment services firms in the U.S., we are able to spread operating costs and amortize new investments over a large base of clients, and harness the resources to evolve capabilities to meet client needs.\n- Operating Efficiency - Coupled with scale, our operating efficiency and sharing of infrastructure across different businesses creates a cost advantage that enables us to competitively price products and services while profitably serving clients of various sizes across multiple channels.\n- Operating Structure - Providing bank and asset management services to broker-dealer clients helps serve a wider array of needs, thereby deepening relationships, enhancing the stability of client assets, and enabling diversified revenue streams.\n- Brand and Corporate Reputation - In an industry dependent on trust, Schwab's reputation and brand across multiple constituents enable us to attract clients and employees while credibly introducing new products to the market.\n- Service Culture - Delivering a great client experience earns the trust and loyalty of clients and increases the likelihood that those clients will refer others.\n- Willingness to Disrupt - Management's willingness to challenge the status quo, including our own business practices, to benefit clients fosters innovation and continuous improvement, which helps to attract more clients and assets.\n\n## Business and Asset Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of TD Ameritrade\n\nEffective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (TDA Holding) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'TD Ameritrade' or 'TDA'). TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its futures commission merchant (FCM) and forex dealer member (FDM) subsidiary.\n\nTDA provides services to individual retail investors and to RIAs predominantly through the Internet, a national branch network, and relationships with RIAs. TD Ameritrade's sources of net revenues primarily consist of trading revenue, bank deposit account fees, net interest revenue, and asset management and administration fees.\n\n- TDA's trading revenue includes commissions earned on trades of certain securities and derivatives, as well as order flow revenue.\n- Bank deposit account fees are earned through an insured deposit account agreement with TD Bank USA, National Association and TD Bank, National Association (together, the TD Depository Institutions), as well as bank deposit account sweep agreements with other third-party depository institutions, whereby uninvested cash held within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept into deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions.\n- TDA's net interest revenue is generated primarily through margin lending, securities lending activity, as well as segregated and operating cash and investments. Interest-bearing liabilities primarily consist of interest-bearing payables to brokerage clients and long-term debt.\n- TDA's asset management and administration fee revenue includes revenues earned on client assets invested in money market funds, other mutual funds, and certain investment programs. TDA's asset management and administration fees also include referral and asset-based program fees on its client assets managed by independent RIAs utilizing TDA's trading and investing platforms.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife's statutory accounting practices treated surplus notes as surplus rather than debt, which directly influenced the statutory capital and surplus calculations of its U.S. insurance subsidiaries. This treatment impacted the calculation of dividend capacity, as statutory surplus levels were affected by these accounting practices. By 2023, surplus notes remained subordinate to other obligations but required prior regulatory approval for interest and principal payments, reflecting the ongoing influence of statutory accounting on capital structure and liquidity planning. The 2022 surplus levels, shaped by statutory accounting, directly influenced the 2023 disclosures around surplus note prioritization and regulatory constraints on capital distributions.",

        "Hop 1: MET(2022) \u2192 Statutory Accounting Practices: MetLife's U.S. insurance subsidiaries followed statutory accounting principles that treated surplus notes as surplus rather than debt, impacting statutory capital and surplus calculations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n\n## 16. Equity (continued)\n\nPerformance Units amounts above represent aggregate awards at target, and do not reflect potential increases or decreases that may result from the performance factor. At December 31, 2021, the performance period for the 2019 - 2021 Performance Unit grants was completed, but the performance factor had not yet been determined. Included in the immediately preceding table are 156,090 outstanding Performance Units to which the 2019 - 2021 performance factor will be applied.\n\n## Statutory Equity and Income\n\nThe states of domicile of MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. insurance subsidiaries each impose risk-based capital ('RBC') requirements that were developed by the NAIC. American Life does not write business in Delaware or any other U.S. state and, as such, is exempt from RBC requirements by Delaware law. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's total adjusted capital, calculated in the manner prescribed by the NAIC ('TAC'), to its authorized control level RBC, calculated in the manner prescribed by the NAIC ('ACL RBC'), based on the statutory-based filed financial statements. Companies below specific trigger levels or ratios are classified by their respective levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences is twice ACL RBC ('Company Action Level RBC'). While not required by or filed with insurance regulators,  the  Company  also  calculates  an  internally  defined  combined  RBC  ratio  ('Statement-Based  Combined  RBC  Ratio'), which is determined by dividing the sum of TAC for MetLife, Inc.'s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life, by the sum of Company Action Level RBC for such subsidiaries. The Company's Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 360% and in excess of 350% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, all non-exempted U.S. insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded Company Action Level RBC for all periods presented.\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s foreign insurance operations are regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions in which each entity operates and are subject to minimum capital and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions before corrective action commences. At  December 31, 2021 and 2020, the adjusted capital  of American  Life's  insurance  subsidiary  in  Japan,  the  Company's  largest foreign  insurance  operation,  was  in  excess  of  four  times  the  200%  solvency  margin  ratio  that  would  require  corrective  action. Excluding Japan, the aggregate required capital and surplus of the Company's other foreign insurance operations was $4.3 billion and  the  aggregate  actual  regulatory  capital  and  surplus  of  such  operations  was  $10.6  billion  as  of  the  date  of  the  most  recent required capital adequacy calculation for each jurisdiction. The Company's foreign insurance operations exceeded the minimum capital and solvency requirements as of the date of the most recent fiscal year-end capital adequacy calculation for each jurisdiction.\n\nMetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries  prepare  statutory-basis  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  statutory  accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile or applicable foreign jurisdiction. The NAIC has adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles ('Statutory Codification'). Statutory Codification is intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments. However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices. Modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the effect of Statutory Codification on the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\n\nStatutory  accounting  principles  differ  from  GAAP  primarily  by  charging  policy  acquisition  costs  to  expense  as  incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.\n\nIn addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net deferred income tax assets resulting from temporary differences between statutory  accounting  principles  basis  and  tax  basis  not  expected  to  reverse  and  become  recoverable  within  three  years.  Further, statutory  accounting  principles  do  not  give  recognition  to  purchase  accounting  adjustments.  MetLife,  Inc.'s  U.S.  insurance subsidiaries have no material state prescribed accounting practices, except as described below.\n\nNew York has adopted certain prescribed accounting practices, primarily consisting of the continuous Commissioners' Annuity Reserve Valuation Method, which impacts deferred annuities, and the New York Special Considerations Letter, which mandates certain assumptions in asset adequacy testing. The collective impact of these prescribed accounting practices decreased the statutory capital and surplus of MLIC by $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared to what capital and surplus would have been had it been measured under NAIC guidance.",

MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance subsidiaries  are  subject  to  regulatory  restrictions  on  the  payment  of  dividends  imposed  by  the  regulators  of  their  respective domiciles.  See  Note  16  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  dividend  limitation  for  U.S.  insurance subsidiaries  is  generally  based  on  the  surplus  to  policyholders  at  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  calendar  year  and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.\n\nThe  table  below  sets  forth  the  dividends  permitted  to  be  paid  by  MetLife,  Inc.'s  primary  U.S.  insurance  subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid:\n\n",

The relationship between Class A and Class B common stock centers on voting rights and convertibility, with Class B shares carrying 10 votes per share and being convertible into Class A shares either at the shareholder's option or upon transfer. By 2024, V reported a significant reduction in Class B common stock shares issued and outstanding, dropping from 245 million in 2023 to 125 million in 2024. This indicates a strategic shift in V's capital structure, likely reflecting increased conversion activity or share retirements, which would reduce the concentration of voting power among major shareholders and align the capital structure more closely with a single-class voting framework.",

      "question": "How did the composition and value of AIG's total collateral in 2022 influence its reliance on the FHLB of New York, and how did this relationship change in 2023 as reflected in AIG's secured borrowing structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AIG reported total collateral of $19,447 million, including $10,532 million in asset-backed securities (ABS) and $8,899 million in bank loans (CLOs). This collateral was used to secure liabilities, including those with the FHLB of New York, which held $15,750 million in liabilities backed by $18,539 million in collateral as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, AIG's secured borrowing from the FHLB of New York had decreased to $241 million, with payments due in 2024 and 2025, indicating a reduced reliance on this funding source compared to the prior year. This suggests a strategic shift in AIG's collateral management and funding mix, with a move away from heavy dependence on the FHLB of New York.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG noted that the proportion of large deductible business had increased over time, which slowed the reporting pattern of claims in their U.S. Workers' Compensation line. This trend directly influenced the complexity and structure of risk-sharing features in 2024, as AIG continued to offer policies with high deductibles, self-insured retentions, and retrospective rating features across its U.S. Other Casualty lines. The growing prevalence of these deductible-heavy structures required AIG to manage increasingly complex, multi-product risk-sharing programs that spanned multiple years and were subject to amendment over time, reflecting a strategic and operational evolution in how AIG structured its risk-sharing features to accommodate client demand and underwriting dynamics.",

The Firm manages its exposure  to  these  derivative  contracts  through  a  variety  of  risk  mitigation strategies,  which  include  managing  the  credit  and  correlation  risk  across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and  cash  positions. Aggregate  market  risk  limits  have  been  established  for credit  derivatives,  and  market  risk  measures  are  routinely  monitored  against these limits. The Firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the Firm under CDS where credit protection was sold.\n\nSingle-Name CDS. A CDS protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. The protection buyer pays a periodic  premium  (generally  quarterly)  over  the  life  of  the  contract  and  is protected for the period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a CDS if a credit event  as  defined  under  the  contract  occurs.

          "chunk_text": "## CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 11-REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\n## Regulation and Capital Adequacy\n\nThe Company and the Banks are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the  Comptroller  of  the  Currency  ('OCC')  respectively  (the  'Basel  III  Capital  Rules').  The  Basel  III  Capital  Rules  implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('Basel Committee'), along with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions. Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to  prompt  corrective  action  ('PCA')  capital  regulations,  which  require  the  Federal  Reserve,  OCC  and  the  Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the 'Federal Banking Agencies') to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet PCA capital requirements.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a  minimum  leverage  ratio  of  4.0%  and  a  minimum  supplementary  leverage  ratio  of  3.0%.  We  are  also  subject  to  the  capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements, as described below.\n\nFollowing amendments to the Basel III Capital Rules in October 2019 by the Federal Banking Agencies to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions (the 'Tailoring Rules'), the Company, as  a  bank  holding  company  ('BHC')  with  total  consolidated  assets  of  at  least  $250  billion  but  less  than  $700  billion  and  not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, is a Category III institution.\n\nAs a Category III institution, effective January 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework and certain associated capital requirements, and we have elected to exclude certain elements of AOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. We remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%) and supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3.0%.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks ('G-SIBs') that are based in the U.S. are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement known as the 'G-SIB Surcharge.' We are not a G-SIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a GSIB Surcharge.\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule (the 'CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the current expected credit loss ('CECL') standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact are being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife categorized certain separate accounts under the Level 2 asset category, where their fair value was based on reported NAV provided by fund managers, reflecting transfer values and offering reasonable price transparency. By 2024, these separate accounts remained subject to the same valuation methodology but were explicitly governed by insurance laws that restricted their use for settling general liabilities and required separate reporting of assets and liabilities. The 2024 documentation reinforced that separate account assets were only accessible to general account claims if their value exceeded liabilities, indicating a more structured and legally bounded reporting consistency compared to 2022.",

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Business\n\n'MetLife' and the 'Company' refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. MetLife is one of the world's leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MetLife is organized into six segments: G roup Benefits; Retirement and Income Solutions ('RIS'); Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa ('EMEA'); and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate &amp; Other. See Note 2 for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate &amp; Other.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP') requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Company's business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities ('VIEs') for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\n\nThe Company uses either the equity method of accounting or the fair value option ('FVO') for its investments in real estate joint ventures ('REJV ') and other limited partnership interests ('OLPI') when it has more than a minor ownership interest or more than a minor influence over the investee's operations. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee's earnings in net investment income on a three-month lag in instances where the investee's financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee's reporting period differs from the Company's reporting period.\n\n## Held-for-Sale\n\nThe Company classifies a business as held-for-sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business, the sale is probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current estimated fair value and certain other specified criteria are met. The business classified as held-for-sale is recorded at the lower of the carrying value and estimated fair value, less cost to sell. If the carrying value of the business ex ceeds its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, a loss is recognized and reported in net investment gains (losses). If the estimated fair value subsequently increases prior to sale, a gain is recognized and reported in net investment gains (losses) but will not exceed the losses recognized since the business was classified as held-for-sale. Assets and liabilities related to the business classified as held-for-sale are separately reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheets in the period in which the business first meets all the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale and in each reporting period thereafter until sold. See Note 3. If a component of the Company has either been disposed of or is classified as heldfor-sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, the results of the component are reported in discontinued operations.\n\n## Separate Accounts\n\nSeparate accounts are established in conformity with insurance laws. G enerally, the assets of the separate accounts cannot be used to settle the liabilities that arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account assets are subject to general account claims only to the extent the value of such assets exceeds the separate account liabilities. The Company separately reports, as separate account assets and liabilities, investments held in separate accounts and corresponding policyholder liabilities of the same amount if all of the following criteria are met:",

      "question": "How did MetLife's use of matrix pricing for foreign government securities evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of valuation inputs and reliance on observable market data?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that foreign government securities were primarily valued using the market approach, with key inputs including quoted prices in inactive markets, benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, issuer spreads, and broker-dealer quotations. By 2023, MetLife's valuation methodology continued to rely on matrix pricing, but with an increased emphasis on market-standard valuation methodologies that prioritize observable inputs when available, and a more explicit acknowledgment of the use of discounted cash flow methodologies and unobservable inputs when market data is lacking. The 2023 filing also noted that separate account liabilities were set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets, which included investments measured using NAV practical expedients, such as $52 million at the end of 2023. This reflects a refinement in MetLife\u2019s approach to align with broader fair value hierarchy disclosures and a more nuanced treatment of liquidity and market transparency.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

This foundational approach carried into 2024, where AIG expanded its Homeowners' Insurance offerings under the Private Client Select (PCS) umbrella, targeting high net-worth individuals with tailored products such as coverage for auto, homeowners, umbrella, yacht, fine art, and collections. The 2024 strategy specifically called for continued underwriting discipline, improved retentions, and rate adequacy to meet risk/return hurdles, indicating a direct evolution from the 2023 framework.

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express relied heavily on AENB as its primary vehicle for retail deposit funding, with $84.4 billion in deposits as of December 31, 2021. AENB was subject to regulatory capital requirements under the FDIA, which imposed constraints on dividend distributions and brokered deposits if capital ratios fell below certain thresholds. Additionally, a 2020 FDIC rule updated brokered deposit regulations, which came into effect in April 2021, expanding the definition of deposit brokers and tightening interest rate restrictions for less-than-well-capitalized banks. This regulatory environment meant that AENB\u2019s ability to raise deposits was closely tied to maintaining strong capital ratios. By 2024, American Express had maintained capital ratios above regulatory minimums, qualifying as 'well capitalized' under both the Federal Reserve and OCC frameworks. This suggests that the strategic investment in AENB in 2022 was managed in a way that supported long-term capital adequacy, despite the heightened regulatory scrutiny on brokered deposits and capital distributions.",

These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. Direct retail deposits offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account and certificates of deposit (CDs) products available directly to consumers. AENB also offers checking account products and sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2021, we had $84.4 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits.\n\n## SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS\n\nShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2021, we had nil commercial paper outstanding and an average of nil in commercial paper outstanding during 2021. Refer to Note 8 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these borrowings.\n\n## LONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $38.7 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. During 2021, we issued $5.8 billion of unsecured debt and asset-backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 5 years. Refer to Note 8 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations.\n\nWe periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDue to the economic uncertainty related to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 for all bank holding companies participating in CCAR, but allowed them to pay common stock dividends provided (a) they did not increase the amount of the dividend and (b) the dividends did not exceed the average of a firm's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. During the first and second quarters of 2021, the Federal Reserve allowed bank holding companies participating in CCAR to repurchase common stock and pay common stock dividends provided (a) the repurchases and dividends, in the aggregate, did not exceed the average of a firm's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters and (b) the firm did not increase the amount of its common stock dividends beyond the level paid in the second quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also permitted stock repurchases equal to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation. These capital distribution restrictions ceased to apply on July 1, 2021. For additional information regarding our capital distributions, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\nWe may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan following certain events or developments, such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in our risk profile or financial condition. If we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions (including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases), other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument.\n\n## Dividends and Other Capital Distributions\n\nThe Company and TRS, as well as AENB and the Company's insurance and other regulated subsidiaries, are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes, regulations and supervisory policy.\n\nCommon stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the Company are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve, as described above. The Company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if, among other things, (i) the Company's regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan.\n\nIn general, federal laws and regulations prohibit, without first obtaining the OCC's approval, AENB from making dividend distributions to TRS, if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause AENB to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS, federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution.\n\n## Prompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC (such as AENB) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. In order to be considered 'well capitalized,' AENB must maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively.\n\nUnder the FDIA, AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits (i.e., deposits raised through third-party brokerage networks) or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A portion of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits.\n\nIn December 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule intended to update and modernize the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations. Effective April 1, 2021, the final rule, among other things, expanded the definition of 'deposit broker' and updated the interest rate restrictions for less than well capitalized banks.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife used matrix pricing, yield curves, and indices to value foreign government securities when broker quotes were unavailable, relying on either observable or unobservable inputs depending on market transparency. By 2023, MetLife continued to apply matrix pricing for foreign government securities but placed greater emphasis on observable market data, particularly for Level 2 assets, which included directly held investments in U.S. and foreign government securities. The 2023 disclosures also clarified that Level 2 separate accounts were based on NAV with 'reasonable levels of price transparency' and could be corroborated through observable market data. This evolution reflects a more detailed alignment with fair value hierarchy classifications, especially Level 2, compared to the 2022 disclosures, which did not specify hierarchy levels but outlined the general methodology.",

Fair Value (continued)\n\n- (4) Derivative assets are presented within other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheets and derivative liabilities are presented within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are presented gross in the tables above to reflect the presentation on the consolidated balance sheets, but are presented net for purposes of the rollforward in the Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) tables.\n- (5) Embedded derivatives within asset host contracts are presented within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets. Embedded derivatives within liability host contracts are presented within policyholder account balances and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n- (6) Investment performance related to separate account assets is fully offset by corresponding amounts  credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected within separate account liabilities. Separate account liabilities are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets. Separate account liabilities presented in the tables above represent derivative liabilities.\n- (7) Total assets included in the fair value hierarchy exclude other limited partnership interests that are measured at estimated fair value using the net asset value ('NAV') per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value of such investments was $99 million and $75 million, respectively.\n\nThe following describes the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.\n\n## Investments\n\n## Securities, Short-term Investments and Other Investments\n\nWhen available, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company's securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management's judgment.\n\nWhen quoted prices in active markets are not available, the determination of estimated fair value of securities is based on market standard valuation methodologies, giving priority to observable inputs. The significant inputs to the market standard valuation  methodologies  for  certain  types  of  securities  with  reasonable  levels  of  price  transparency  are  inputs  that  are observable  in  the  market  or  can  be  derived  principally  from,  or  corroborated  by,  observable  market  data. When  observable inputs are not available, the market standard valuation methodologies rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management's judgment or estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market activity. Unobservable inputs are based on management's assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing such investments.\n\nThe  estimated  fair  value  of  short-term  investments  and  other  investments  is  determined  on  a  basis  consistent  with  the methodologies described herein.\n\nThe valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair  value  hierarchy  are  presented  below. The  primary  valuation  approaches  are  the  market  approach,  which considers recent prices from market transactions involving identical or similar assets or liabilities, and the income approach, which  converts  expected  future  amounts  (e.g.  cash  flows)  to  a  single  current,  discounted  amount.  The  valuation  of  most instruments listed below is determined using independent pricing sources, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow methodologies or other similar techniques that use either observable market inputs or unobservable inputs.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the proportion of MET's Total CMBS investments rated Aaa and Aa change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's risk profile in its commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MET's CMBS portfolio had $8,262 million rated Aaa and Aa, representing 83.0% of the total CMBS holdings. By 2024, this amount decreased to $7,467 million, or 81.3% of the total CMBS portfolio. This indicates a slight decline in the proportion of high-rated securities, suggesting a marginal increase in the risk profile of MET's CMBS investments year-over-year.",

        "Hop 1: MET(2023) \u2192 Aaa/Aa Rated: MET disclosed $8,262 million in Aaa/Aa-rated CMBS in 2023, representing 83.0% of the total CMBS portfolio.",
        "Hop 2: Aaa/Aa Rated \u2192 Total CMBS: The Aaa/Aa-rated securities are a subset of the Total CMBS portfolio, indicating MET's allocation to high-quality, lower-risk CMBS assets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One disclosed that they utilized multiple vendor pricing services to determine fair value for securities, including CMBS, noting that some vendors had limitations in providing unobservable input data due to software licensing restrictions. This led to a composite summary of inputs for securities available for sale, including CMBS. By 2023, the weighted average default rate used in vendor pricing models for CMBS had stabilized at 7%, with a weighted average loss severity of 61%, indicating a more consistent application of vendor pricing inputs across CMBS valuations compared to the previous year.",

(4)\n\n## Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Inputs\n\nGenerally, uncertainties in fair value measurements of financial instruments, such as changes in unobservable inputs, may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction  for  a  given  change  in  another  input.  In  general,  an  increase  in  the  discount  rate,  default  rates,  loss  severity  or  credit spreads,  in  isolation,  would  result  in  a  decrease  in  the  fair  value  measurement.  In  addition,  an  increase  in  default  rates  would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.\n\n## Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  to  determine  the  fair  values  of  our  Level  3  financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they  provide  a  valuation. As  a  result,  the  unobservable  input  information  for  the  securities  available  for  sale  presented  below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "question": "How did the shift in MS's exposure to commercial mortgage loans from 2023 to 2024 impact their investment in CMBS, particularly in terms of fair value changes and risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MS's exposure to commercial mortgage loans was part of a broader set of variable interests in VIEs, including liquidity facilities and credit support, with maximum exposure tied to notional amounts and fair value of assets held, such as those in Investment Securities. Commercial mortgage loans were a key component of CMBS, which are structured products backed by multiple commercial mortgages. By 2024, MS had a direct stake in CMBS with a fair value of $5,316 million (AFS) and $1,066 million (HTM) for agency CMBS, and $1,340 million (HTM) for non-agency CMBS. The fair value of AFS CMBS showed a gross unrealized loss of $388 million, indicating a decline in market value. This suggests that MS's exposure to commercial mortgage loans in 2023 evolved into a more direct and quantifiable investment in CMBS by 2024, with measurable changes in value and associated risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MS](2023) \u2192 [Commercial Mortgage Loans]: MS had exposure to commercial mortgage loans through variable interests in VIEs, including liquidity facilities and credit support, with exposure measured by notional amounts and fair value of assets held.",
        "Hop 2: [Commercial Mortgage Loans] \u2192 [CMBS]: Commercial mortgage loans are a key component in the composition of CMBS, which are structured as securities backed by multiple commercial mortgage loans.",
        "Hop 3: [CMBS] \u2190 [MS](2024): By 2024, MS held CMBS directly, including both agency and non-agency CMBS, with specific fair values and unrealized losses reported, indicating a measurable shift in exposure and risk."

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab issued 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates as part of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with TD Bank subsequently exchanging 2 million shares of common stock for nonvoting shares, bringing its total nonvoting stake to 79 million shares by year-end. This ownership structure was subject to a regulatory 9.9% ownership cap interpreted under Federal Reserve rules, as noted in the 2022 filings. In 2023, Schwab explicitly acknowledged that ongoing relationships with TD Bank could negatively impact Schwab if TD Bank or its affiliates unintentionally exceeded this ownership threshold or if revenue sharing between the entities exceeded regulatory limits. These constraints could trigger presumptions of control under the Federal Reserve's regulations, potentially limiting Schwab\u2019s strategic flexibility and competitive positioning in the market, as outlined in the 2023 filing.",

Stockholders' Equity\n\nExcept in connection with the 2020 acquisition of TD Ameritrade as described below, CSC did not issue shares of common stock through external offerings during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company issued shares of CSC common stock and a new, nonvoting class of CSC common stock. Immediately prior to the acquisition, on October 6, 2020, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to create the nonvoting class of common stock with 300 million shares authorized for issuance and to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock by the same amount. Each share of nonvoting common stock has identical rights to common stock, including liquidation and dividend rights, except that holders of nonvoting common stock have no voting rights other than over matters that significantly and adversely affect the rights or preferences of the nonvoting common stock, or as required by applicable law. Holders of nonvoting common stock are restricted from transferring shares except for permitted inside or outside transfers, as defined in the certificate of incorporation. Shares of nonvoting stock transferred in a permitted outside transfer are automatically converted to shares of common stock.\n\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, CSC issued approximately 177 million shares of common stock and approximately 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates on October 6, 2020. Those shares of common stock and nonvoting common stock were issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Following this issuance, TD Bank exchanged an aggregate of approximately 2 million shares of CSC common stock for an equal number of shares of CSC nonvoting common stock and held approximately 79 million shares of nonvoting common stock as of December 31, 2021. TD Bank and its affiliates are not permitted to own more than 9.9% of CSC common stock.

      "answer": "The continued authorization of 116 million Class A shares under the LTIP in both 2022 and 2023 suggests that MA maintained a consistent equity compensation framework across these years. This stability in share availability supports long-term incentive programs like Options, RSUs, and PSUs, which are central to employee retention and performance alignment. Given that the aggregate market value of Class A shares reached $328.8 billion by mid-2023, the sustained authorization likely enables MA to continue leveraging its strong stock valuation as a strategic component of compensation, ensuring that equity awards remain meaningful and valuable to employees.",

Share-Based Payments\n\nIn May 2006, the Company granted the following awards under the Mastercard Incorporated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, which was amended and restated as of June 5,  2012  (the  'LTIP'). The  LTIP  is  a  stockholder-approved  plan  that  permits  the  grant  of various types of equity awards to employees. The Company has granted Options, RSUs and PSUs under the LTIP. The Company uses the straight-line method of attribution for expensing all equity awards. Compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures, with estimates adjusted as appropriate.\n\nThere are approximately 116 million shares of Class A common stock authorized for equity awards under the LTIP. Although the LTIP permits the issuance of shares of Class B common stock, no such shares have been authorized for issuance. Shares issued as a result of Option exercises and the conversions of RSUs and PSUs were funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of Class A common stock.\n\n## Stock Options\n\nOptions  expire  ten  years  from  the  date  of  grant  and  vest  ratably  over  four  years.  For  Options  granted,  a  participant's  unvested awards are forfeited upon termination. In the event a participant terminates employment due to disability or retirement more than seven months after receiving the award, however, the participant retains all of their awards without providing additional service to the Company. Retirement eligibility is dependent upon age and years of service. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period as stated in the LTIP.\n\nThe fair  value  of  each  Option  is  estimated  on  the  date  of  grant  using  a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model. The  following  table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation and the resulting weighted-average fair value per Option granted for the years ended December 31:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, TD Bank and its affiliates held approximately 51 million shares of nonvoting common stock in SCHW, which automatically converted from nonvoting to common stock through permitted transfers and repurchase agreements. By 2024, TD Bank had sold all remaining common and nonvoting common stock holdings through a secondary public offering and a direct repurchase, effectively exiting its equity stake. Despite this, the strategic partnership persisted, as evidenced by the continuation of the Insured Deposit Account Agreement dated May 4, 2023, which governed deposit account services between TDBankUSA, TDBank, and multiple Schwab entities.

Stockholders' E quity\n\n## Common and Nonvoting Common Stock\n\nCSC did not issue common shares through external offerings during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\n\nIn conjunction with its acquisition of Ameritrade in 2020, the Company issued shares of a nonvoting class of CSC common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates. Each share of nonvoting common stock has identical rights to common stock, including liquidation and dividend rights, except that holders of nonvoting common stock have no voting rights other than over matters that significantly and adversely affect the rights or preferences of the nonvoting common stock, or as required by applicable law. Holders of nonvoting common stock are restricted from transferring shares except for permitted inside or outside transfers, as defined in the Company's certificate of incorporation. Shares of nonvoting common stock transferred in a permitted outside transfer are automatically converted to shares of common stock.\n\nOn August 1, 2022, an affiliate of TD Bank executed a permitted outside transfer of 13 million shares of CSC nonvoting common stock, upon which the shares of nonvoting common stock automatically converted to shares of common stock. Following this transfer and CSC's repurchase of nonvoting common stock described below, TD Bank and its affiliates held approximately 51 million shares of nonvoting common stock as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024.\n\n## Share Repurchase Program\n\nOn July 27, 2022, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization to repurchase up to $15.0 billion of common stock, replacing the previous and now terminated share repurchase authorization of up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date.\n\nOn August 1, 2022, CSC purchased, directly from an affiliate of TD Bank, 15 million shares of nonvoting common stock for a total of $1.0 billion, or approximately $66.53 per share. The shares of nonvoting common stock automatically converted into common stock and were purchased under CSC's share repurchase authorization. The purchase price paid by CSC was equal to the lowest price per share that the affiliate of TD Bank received in a contemporaneous share sale facilitated by a third-party market maker, which resulted in a purchase price lower than the closing price on August 1, 2022. CSC repurchased an additional 32 million shares of its common stock under the authorization for $2.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nCSC repurchased 37 million shares of its common stock for $2.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no repurchases of CSC's common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $8.7 billion remained on the new authorization.\n\nShare repurchases, net of issuances, are subject to a nondeductible excise tax which was recognized as a direct and incremental cost associated with these transactions.\n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, TD Bank and its affiliates sold all remaining common and nonvoting common stock holdings through a secondary public offering and a direct repurchase. See Note 28 for additional information regarding the secondary offering and repurchase.\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nOn March 4, 2022, the Company issued and sold 750,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 5.000% fixed-rate reset noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series K, $.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent of $1,000 per depositary share). The net proceeds of the offering were $740 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\n\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company redeemed all of the 400,000 outstanding shares of its fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series A at a redemption price of $1,000 per share for a total of $400 million.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, the Company redeemed all of the 6,000 outstanding shares of its fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series E, and the corresponding 600,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Series E preferred stock. The depositary shares were redeemed at a redemption price of $1,000 per depositary share for a total of $600 million.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the conversion rate of Series B Preferred Stock into Class A Common Stock was 2.9710, resulting in 7 million as-converted shares. By 2024, the conversion rate increased to 6.3210, doubling the as-converted shares to 16 million. This significant increase in the conversion rate altered the voting rights structure, as Series B Preferred Stockholders gained more influence upon conversion, with voting rights now tied to a larger pool of Class A Common Stock shares. Class A Common Stock remained the primary voting class, with 1,733 million shares outstanding in 2024, up from 1,635 million in 2022, reinforcing its central role in corporate governance decisions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Morgan Stanley was in the second year of phasing in the CECL deferral impact, with the effects on risk-based capital amounts and ratios, RWA, adjusted average assets, and supplementary leverage exposure calculations at 50%. This followed the initial 25% phase-in starting in 2022. By 2024, the deferral remained in place, indicating a continued strategic use of the five-year transition period to manage capital ratios. The deferral applied to both Morgan Stanley and its subsidiary Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.

      "question": "How did the reduction in Class A common stock shares outstanding from 925,723,131 in 2023 to 907,000,000 in 2024, alongside stable Class B stock voting power at 15 votes per share, affect the relative voting control dynamics at MA, and what implications does this have for corporate governance and treasury stock management given the increase in Class A treasury stock from $60,429M to $71,431M?",
      "answer": "The reduction in Class A common stock shares outstanding from 925,723,131 in 2023 to 907,000,000 in 2024, combined with the stable 15-vote per share structure for Class B common stock, increased the relative voting control of Class B shareholders. This is further amplified by the significant increase in Class A treasury stock from $60,429M in 2023 to $71,431M in 2024, which effectively removed more Class A shares from circulation, thereby concentrating voting power further in the hands of Class B shareholders. This shift in voting control has important implications for corporate governance, as it entrenches the influence of the Class B shareholder (Mr. Brian L. Roberts) over key decisions such as board elections and strategic direction. Additionally, the increased treasury stock reflects a strategic use of capital that may signal management\u2019s confidence in long-term value, but also raises questions about potential dilution of minority shareholder influence.",

By 2024, MET continued to disclose that its CMBS portfolio was primarily composed of conduit securities, maintaining the same structure of broad diversification.

      "question": "How did the conversion rate of Series C Preferred Stock into Class A Common Stock change from 2022 to 2023, and what implications does this have for the voting rights of Series C Preferred Stockholders under the Company's governance structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the conversion rate of Series C Preferred Stock into Class A Common Stock was 3.6450, resulting in 12 million as-converted Class A Common Stock. By 2023, the conversion rate increased to 6.8340, leading to 22 million as-converted Class A Common Stock. This significant increase in the conversion rate means that Series C Preferred Stockholders would have a greater number of votes when casting their shares in matters where they are entitled to vote. According to the governance structure, Series C Preferred Stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held, which implies that the change in conversion rate enhances their voting influence in specified corporate actions such as mergers or amendments affecting preferred stock terms.",

      "question": "How did AIG's exposure to CMBS in 2023, including its associated unrealized losses, relate to its increased focus on structured securities in 2024, particularly in terms of risk appetite and investment strategy adjustments under BlackRock management?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AIG held $11.056 billion in CMBS with $1.246 billion in gross unrealized losses, indicating a significant but declining position compared to 2022. CMBS is classified as part of Structured Securities, which in 2024 became a focal point of AIG\u2019s investment strategy under BlackRock management. In 2024, AIG emphasized investing in structured securities with 'attractive risk-adjusted return characteristics' to improve yields, suggesting a strategic recalibration rather than a complete retreat from this asset class. This indicates that while CMBS underperformance may have influenced a more selective or optimized approach, the broader category of structured securities remained a key component of AIG\u2019s investment portfolio, managed with updated risk-return parameters under BlackRock\u2019s oversight.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG(2023) \u2192 CMBS: AIG disclosed a CMBS portfolio of $11.056 billion with $1.246 billion in gross unrealized losses, down from $13.348 billion in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: CMBS \u2192 Structured Securities: CMBS is explicitly categorized as part of AIG\u2019s Structured Securities, which include RMBS, ABS/CLO, and similar instruments.",
        "Hop 3: Structured Securities \u2190 AIG(2024): AIG increased its strategic focus on structured securities in 2024, managed by BlackRock, aiming to improve yields through risk-adjusted returns despite prior CMBS losses."

          "chunk_text": "## Investments\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nOur investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each segment by targeting an asset allocation mix that supports estimated cash flow needs of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.\n\n## Our Investment Management Agreements with BlackRock, Inc.\n\nSince April 2022, A IG insurance company subsidiaries have entered into separate investment management agreements with BlackRock, Inc. and its investment advisory affiliates (BlackRock). A s of December 31, 2024, BlackRock manages $62 billion of our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income, certain private placements and private equity assets. In addition, liquid fix ed income assets associated with the Fortitude Re funds withheld asset portfolio were separately transferred to BlackRock for management in 2022.\n\n## INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS IN 2024\n\n- Blended investment yields on new investments are higher than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called during this period. We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with attractive risk-adjusted return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.\n- Total Net investment income increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to dividend income from AIG's equity in Corebridge, higher income on available for sale fixed maturity securities and short term instruments, partially offset by mortgage loans.\n\n## INVESTMENT STRATEGIES\n\nInvestment strategies are assessed at the segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market and economic conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax, regulatory and legal investment limitations, and, as applicable, environmental, social and governance considerations.\n\nSome of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n\n- Our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar duration and cash flow characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable.\n- We seek to purchase investments that offer enhanced yield through illiquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. These assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs, and deeper due diligence given information access.\n- Given our global presence, we seek investments that provide diversification from investments available in local markets. To the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge any currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to investments in the functional currency.\n- AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities, counterparties and duration. A IG Parent's liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash and short-term investments. This strategy allows us to both diversify our sources of liquidity and reduce the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n- Within the U.S., General Insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios.\n- -Insurance reserves are backed mainly by investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our duration, risk-return, capital, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectiv es. We assess asset classes based on their fundamental underlying risk factors, including credit (public and private), commercial real estate and residential real estate, regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans, or structured products.\n- -Surplus investments seek to enhance portfolio returns and are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity, and hedge funds. Over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n62\n\nITEM 7 | Investments",

      "question": "What risks does AENB's $5.0 billion dividend payout in 2024 pose to AXP's ability to maintain its leverage ratio requirements, given AXP's reliance on AENB's capital levels for deposit funding?",
      "answer": "AXP's 2022 filing shows that both the company and its subsidiary AENB are subject to leverage ratio requirements by the Federal Reserve and OCC, respectively, and must maintain minimum Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on-balance sheet assets. In 2024, AENB paid a $5.0 billion dividend to its parent, which could reduce its retained earnings and, in turn, impact its capital levels. AXP's 2024 filing highlights that its ability to fund its business and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is directly dependent on AENB's capital levels. Therefore, the large dividend payout may strain AENB's capital adequacy, potentially affecting AXP's ability to meet its regulatory leverage ratio requirements and maintain sufficient deposit funding.",

        "Hop 1: AXP(2022) \u2192 Leverage Ratio Requirements: AXP and its subsidiary AENB are subject to minimum Tier 1 leverage ratios by their regulators.",

        "Hop 3: AENB \u2190 AXP(2024): AXP's deposit funding and ability to support its business depends on AENB's capital levels, which were reduced by a $5.0 billion dividend payout in 2024."

It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on preferred and common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders generated over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies are required by statute to be a source of strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries and should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to do so. On an annual basis, we are required to develop and maintain a capital plan, which includes planned dividends. We may be subject to limitations and restrictions on our dividends, if, among other things, (i) our regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) we are required to resubmit our capital plan.\n\n## BANK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, AENB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $5.0 billion. AENB is limited in its ability to pay dividends by banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. In general, applicable federal and state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as AENB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available retained earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. If AENB's risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and applicable buffers, it will face graduated constraints on dividends and other capital distributions. In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB must also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies. In addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.",

      "question": "How does AXP's increased dividend receipts from its subsidiary AENB (rising from $3.6 billion in 2023 to $5.0 billion in 2024) reflect its capital management strategy in relation to evolving capital adequacy standards imposed on insured depository institutions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AXP received $3.6 billion in dividends from AENB, its insured depository institution, which was constrained by regulatory capital adequacy standards that limit distributions if they would cause AENB to fall below required risk-based capital ratios or leverage requirements. By 2024, AXP received a significantly higher dividend of $5.0 billion from AENB, indicating that AENB maintained or improved its capital position sufficiently to meet these standards even after larger distributions. This suggests that AXP's capital management strategy leveraged AENB's strong adherence to capital adequacy standards to increase upstream liquidity while remaining compliant with evolving regulatory constraints, including those related to risk-based capital ratios and supervisory expectations.",

        "Hop 1: AXP(2023) \u2192 AENB: AXP has a stake in AENB and received $3.6 billion in dividends from it in 2023",
        "Hop 2: AENB \u2192 Capital Adequacy Standards: AENB is subject to regulatory requirements that constrain dividend payments if capital ratios fall below thresholds",
        "Hop 3: Capital Adequacy Standards \u2190 AXP(2024): In 2024, AXP received a higher $5.0 billion dividend from AENB, implying AENB met or exceeded capital adequacy standards to support the larger distribution"

It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on preferred and common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders generated over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies are required by statute to be a source of strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries and should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to do so. On an annual basis, we are required to develop and maintain a capital plan, which includes planned dividends. We may be subject to limitations and restrictions on our dividends, if, among other things, (i) our regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) we are required to resubmit our capital plan.\n\n## BANK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, AENB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $5.0 billion. AENB is limited in its ability to pay dividends by banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. In general, applicable federal and state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as AENB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available retained earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. If AENB's risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and applicable buffers, it will face graduated constraints on dividends and other capital distributions. In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB must also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies. In addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of Schwab's relationship with TD Bank from 2023 to 2024 influence the company's nonvoting common stock holdings and repurchase strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Schwab maintained a complex relationship with TD Bank, primarily due to the legacy of the TD Ameritrade acquisition, which included regulatory concerns around Schwab being deemed 'controlled' by TD Bank under the BHC Act if TD Bank held more than 9.9% of Schwab common stock. This relationship directly influenced Schwab's stock structure, as it had issued nonvoting common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates in 2020. By 2024, Schwab had not repurchased any additional shares, but TD Bank and its affiliates still held approximately 51 million shares of nonvoting common stock as of December 31, 2024. This reflects a continuation of the stockholding structure established in prior years, with no new repurchases in 2024 despite $8.7 billion still available under the repurchase authorization. The relationship with TD Bank, particularly around stock ownership and the structure of nonvoting shares, remained a key factor in Schwab's capital allocation decisions and regulatory considerations throughout the period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SCHW(2023) \u2192 TD Bank: Schwab had ongoing regulatory concerns related to its relationship with TD Bank, particularly around the 9.9% ownership threshold that could trigger a presumption of control under the Federal Reserve's regulations.",
        "Hop 2: TD Bank \u2192 Nonvoting Common Stock: As part of the TD Ameritrade acquisition in 2020, Schwab issued nonvoting common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates, which could convert to voting shares under certain transfer conditions.",
        "Hop 3: Nonvoting Common Stock \u2190 SCHW(2024): By the end of 2024, TD Bank and its affiliates still held approximately 51 million shares of nonvoting common stock, and Schwab had ceased share repurchases during the year, leaving $8.7 billion remaining in the repurchase program."

      "question": "How did AIG's decrease in holdings of state obligations from 2022 to 2023 relate to the changes in the weighted average yield assumptions used in their discounted cash flow valuations for these instruments in 2024?",
      "answer": "AIG decreased its holdings of state obligations from $12,099 million in 2022 to $10,663 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction in exposure. These obligations were valued using discounted cash flow models, and in 2024, AIG reported a weighted average yield assumption of 5.33% for these instruments, up from 5.23% in the prior year. This suggests that the company adjusted its valuation assumptions to reflect either higher risk or changes in market conditions, even as its holdings declined.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Roman Regelman served as Chief Executive Officer of Asset Servicing and Head of Digital, overseeing both the core custody services and digital transformation efforts within BNY Mellon's Securities Services segment. By 2023, Regelman's role had evolved to Senior Executive Vice President and Global Head of Securities Services and Digital, indicating a broader strategic mandate that extended beyond Asset Servicing to encompass the entire Securities Services business. This shift suggests that BNY Mellon integrated digital transformation more holistically into its broader custody and securities services strategy, aligning with the growth in assets under custody/administration from $46.7 trillion in 2022 to $47.8 trillion in 2023.

BUSINESS\n\n## Description of Business\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with $46.7 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration and $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2021. With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.\n\nWe previously divided our businesses into two business segments, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth Management. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we disaggregated our Investment Services business segment into two new business segments, Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services. Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment was not impacted by this resegmentation. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments and certain business exits.\n\nFor a further discussion of BNY Mellon's lines of business, products and services, see the 'Overview,' 'Summary of financial highlights,' 'Fee and other revenue,' 'Review of business segments' and 'International operations' sections in the MD&amp;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See the 'Available Information' section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon.\n\nOur two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:\n\n- The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury\n- Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bank-advised business of Investment Management; and\n- BNY Mellon, National Association ('BNY Mellon, N.A.'), a national bank, which houses our Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses.\n\nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY Mellon's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve').  The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV ('BNY Mellon SA/NV') is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe. It is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Belgium under the Single Supervisory Mechanism and is also supervised by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority for conduct of business rules. BNY Mellon SA/NV has its principal office in Brussels and branches in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Copenhagen, Denmark; Dublin, Ireland; Frankfurt, Germany; the City of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France.  BNY Mellon SA/NV's activities are in the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments of BNY Mellon with a focus on global custody, asset servicing and collateral management.

      "answer": "In 2022, the conversion rate of Series B Preferred Stock into Class A Common Stock was 2.9710, resulting in 7 million as-converted shares. By 2024, the conversion rate had increased to 6.3210 for the same number of preferred shares, also resulting in 16 million as-converted shares. This significant increase in the conversion rate indicates a structural shift in how preferred equity translates into common equity, potentially reflecting changes in valuation assumptions or corporate restructuring. The book value of Series B Preferred Stock also increased from $456 million in 2023 to $540 million in 2024, aligning with this evolution in capital structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MET disclosed an equity market risk exposure of $123 million as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, MET had implemented a risk mitigation strategy involving equity market derivatives, which had a notional value of $23,595 million and an estimated fair value of $(78) million. This strategy was designed to offset potential losses, as evidenced by the $522 million estimated fair value impact from a hypothetical 10% decrease in equity prices affecting the derivatives portfolio. The evolution from a direct risk exposure in 2022 to a hedged position in 2023 demonstrates MET's proactive approach to managing equity market volatility.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory capital requirements under the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule affect Charles Schwab's (SCHW) broker-dealer operations in 2024 compared to 2022, particularly in relation to TDAC's compliance strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TDAC, as a broker-dealer, was subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule and calculated its minimum net capital requirement as the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances or a minimum dollar requirement based on the type of business conducted. This regulatory framework constrained TDAC\u2019s ability to make certain capital distributions if minimum thresholds were not met. By 2024, while TDAC was no longer explicitly mentioned as a separate entity in the regulatory disclosures, CS&Co (which had absorbed TDAC's operations post-acquisition) continued to operate under the same SEC rule, maintaining a minimum net capital of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances or 120% of the minimum dollar requirement. The shift in reporting suggests that Schwab streamlined its compliance strategy post-acquisition, aligning TDAC\u2019s former operations under CS&Co\u2019s capital framework, while still adhering to the same regulatory thresholds. This indicates a structural evolution rather than a regulatory change, preserving capital adequacy under the SEC's rule across both years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SCHW(2022) \u2192 TDAC: Schwab had a stake in TDAC, which was subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule, requiring minimum net capital of 2% of aggregate debit balances or a minimum dollar requirement.",
        "Hop 2: TDAC \u2192 SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule: TDAC was directly regulated under this rule, which imposed constraints on capital distributions if minimum net capital thresholds were not met.",
        "Hop 3: SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule \u2190 SCHW(2024): In 2024, CS&Co (now inclusive of TDAC\u2019s operations) maintained compliance with the same rule, with a stricter interpretation requiring a minimum net capital of 120% of the dollar requirement."

      "answer": "In 2023, Standard & Poor's downgraded CSC's long-term issuer credit and senior unsecured debt ratings from A to A-, while Moody's changed its outlook from positive to stable. This downgrade likely influenced CSC's financing options, as evidenced by the fact that in 2024, CSC entered into an unsecured committed revolving line of credit with external banks totaling $2.1 billion, which expired in January 2025 and was not renewed. Despite this, CSC maintained access to other unsecured uncommitted lines of credit with total borrowing capacity of $1.7 billion in 2024, with no amounts outstanding. The downgrade in 2023 appears to have led to a more conservative credit facility structure in 2024, with a limited-duration committed line and continued access to uncommitted lines, suggesting tighter credit conditions following the rating change.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SCHW was subject to a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, which restricted capital distributions if the firm approached minimum capital thresholds. By 2023, this buffer was replaced by a Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) of 2.5%, which was calculated based on the difference between starting capital and stress test lows, plus projected dividends. This transition, driven by the Federal Reserve's 2021 rule change, introduced a more dynamic capital requirement that tied buffer levels directly to stress test outcomes and forward-looking capital plans, thereby increasing the sensitivity of capital distribution constraints to projected financial performance and stress scenarios.",

Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.\n\n## Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.\n\nNew legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, standards of conduct with clients, conflicts of interest, regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, and order routing practices and order-related revenues may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.\n\n## Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.\n\nCSC, together with its banking, broker-dealer, and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits the ability of our broker-dealer entities to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, capital planning, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.\n\nIn January 2021, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule, effective with the 2022 CCAR cycle, making large savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, subject to the CCAR process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan. The plan must include a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted. The rule also imposes a stress capital buffer requirement, floored at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, that will replace CSC's current 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer for our risk-based capital ratios. The stress capital buffer will equal, as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets, the sum of (i) the difference between a firm's starting common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the firm's projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon to risk-weighted assets as projected under CCAR. The imposition of a stress capital buffer requirement could change the way in which our minimum risk-based capital ratios are calculated and make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios. This could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders.",

By 2024, PayPal continued to rely on third-party custodians, but the number had increased to two, introducing concentration risk if either custodian failed to perform as agreed. Additionally, PayPal formalized its accounting treatment by recognizing a crypto asset safeguarding liability and a corresponding safeguarding asset, both measured at fair value, reflecting a more structured financial accountability framework for custodial risks.

Finance lease amounts include minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable finance leases primarily for computer equipment. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases. We recognize rent expense under such agreements on a straight-line basis.\n\n## NOTE 7-OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT DETAILS\n\n## CRYPTO ASSET SAFEGUARDING LIABILITY AND CORRESPONDING SAFEGUARDING ASSET\n\nWe allow  our  customers  in  certain  markets  to  buy,  hold,  sell,  convert,  receive,  and  send  certain  cryptocurrencies  as  well  as  use  the  proceeds  from  sales  of cryptocurrencies  to  pay  for  purchases  at  checkout.  These  cryptocurrencies  consist  of  Bitcoin,  Ethereum,  Litecoin,  Bitcoin  Cash,  and  PayPal  USD  stablecoin (collectively, 'our customers' crypto assets'). We engage third parties, which are licensed trust companies, to provide certain custodial services, including holding our customers' cryptographic key information, securing our customers' crypto assets, and protecting them from loss or theft, including indemnification against certain types of losses such as theft. Our third-party custodians hold the crypto assets in a custodial account in PayPal's name for the benefit of PayPal's customers. We maintain the internal recordkeeping of our customers' crypto assets, including the amount and type of crypto asset owned by each of our customers in that custodial account. As of December 31, 2024, we utilize two third-party custodians; as such, there is concentration risk in the event these custodians are not able to perform in accordance with our agreements.\n\nDue to the unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks, we recognize a crypto asset safeguarding liability to reflect our obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for the benefit of our customers, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated  balance  sheets.  We  also  recognize  a  corresponding  safeguarding  asset  which  is  recorded  in  prepaid  ex penses  and  other  current  assets  on  our consolidated balance sheets. The crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices for the underlying crypto assets on the active exchange that we have identified as the principal market at the balance sheet date. The corresponding safeguarding asset may be adjusted for loss events, as applicable. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and therefore, the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset were recorded at the same value.\n\nThe following table summarizes the significant crypto assets we hold for the benefit of our customers and the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

In contrast, in 2023, TDAC was still an active broker-dealer subject to this rule and relied on secured borrowing capacity based on collateral pledged. Meanwhile, CS&Co remained subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule in 2024 and reported compliance with net capital requirements, indicating a consolidation of regulatory obligations under CS&Co following TDAC's withdrawal.",

          "chunk_text": "\nPursuant to the SEC's Customer Protection Rule and other applicable regulations, Schwab had cash and investments segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients at December 31, 2024. The SEC's Customer Protection Rule requires broker-dealers to segregate client fully-paid securities and cash balances not collateralizing margin positions and not swept to money market funds or bank deposit accounts. Amounts included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes represent actual balances on deposit, whereas cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2024 for CS&amp;Co totaled $38.2 billion. As of January 3, 2025, CS&amp;Co had deposited $1.8 billion of cash into its segregated reserve accounts. Cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2023 for CS&amp;Co totaled $24.1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes are presented as part of Schwab's cash balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFollowing the completion of the final client account conversions to CS&amp;Co from the Ameritrade broker-dealers in May 2024, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC subsequently submitted Uniform Requests for Broker-Dealer Withdrawal (BDW) to terminate their registration as broker-dealers with the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), and other applicable regulatory organizations. As of December 31, 2024, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC were no longer registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and FINRA and were not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule.\n\n## 25.    Segment Information\n\nSchwab's two reportable segments are Investor Services and Advisor Services. Schwab structures the operating segments according to its clients and the services provided to those clients. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage, investment advisory, and banking and trust services to individual investors, retirement plan and business services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking and trust, and support services to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Schwab's chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are the President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. For the computation of its segment information, Schwab utilizes an activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item ex penses (e.g., compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and professional services) to the business activities driving segment expenses (e.g., client service, opening new accounts, or business development) and a funds transfer pricing methodology to allocate certain revenues.",

In future periods, we may be required to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve for our banking subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends in excess of the amount of recent net income and retained earnings.\n\nAs a broker-dealer, CS&amp;Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit our broker-dealer subsidiary from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to CSC and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2024, CS&amp;Co was in compliance with its net capital requirements.\n\nIn addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab's subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 - Notes 20 and 24 for additional information on the components of stockholders' equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries and CSC (consolidated).\n\nThe following table details the capital ratios for CSC (consolidated) and CSB:\n\n",

      "answer": "The increase in the Class B to Class A common stock conversion rate from 1.6059 in 2022 to 1.6228 in 2023 did not materially impact the overall voting power dynamics between the two classes of common stock at V. This is because the voting rights are structurally fixed, with Class A common stockholders retaining 66 2/3% of the voting power and Class B common stockholders maintaining 33 1/3%, a distribution that is non-dilutable under the terms of the Company's articles of incorporation. Although the conversion rate increased slightly, Class B common stock remains convertible share-for-share into Class A common stock, and the voting power of each class is unaffected by such conversions due to the fixed percentage allocation.",

        "Hop 1: V(2022) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: In 2022, Class B common stock had a conversion rate of 1.6059 into Class A common stock.",

        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 V(2023): In 2023, the conversion rate increased slightly to 1.6228, but the structural voting rights remained unchanged."

      "answer": "In 2022, AXP disclosed that the American Express Credit Account Master Trust held Fixed Rate Class A Certificates with a weighted-average coupon of 0.90%, while AXP itself had Fixed Rate Senior Notes at a 1.27% weighted-average coupon. By 2023, the coupon on the Fixed Rate Class A Certificates increased significantly to 5.02%, aligning with a broader shift in AXP's debt structure, where their Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes rose to a weighted-average coupon of 5.54% during the fixed rate period. This indicates a strategic pivot toward higher-yielding debt instruments, likely in response to rising interest rates and a recalibration of AXP's capital structure to maintain profitability in a higher-rate environment.",

By 2024, Bank of America continued to actively structure CDO VIEs, maintaining a maximum loss exposure of $65 million to CDOs, down from $80 million in 2023.

There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 202 4, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs\n\nThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by  issuing  multiple  tranches  of  debt  and  equity  securities.  CDOs  are  generally managed  by  third-party  portfolio  managers.  The  Corporation  typically  transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation's maximum  loss exposure to consolidated  and  unconsolidated  CDOs  totaled  $65  million  and  $80  million  at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Investment VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  sponsors,  invests  in  or  provides  financing,  which  may  be  in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real  estate,  d eb t  securities  or  oth er  financial  instruments  and   are  d esigned   to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At December 31,  202 4  and  2023,  the  Corporation's  consolidated  investment  VIEs  had  total assets of $6 million and $472\n\nmillion.  The  Corporation  also  h eld   investments  in  unconsolidated  VIEs  with  total assets of $23.0 billion and $18.4 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. The Corporation's  maximum  loss  exposure  associated  with  both  consolidated  and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31,  202 4  and  2023  comprised  primarily  of  on-balance  sheet  assets  less  nonrecourse liabilities.\n\n## Leveraged Lease Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation's  net  investment  in  consolidated  leveraged  lease  trusts  totaled $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. The trusts hold longlived  equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and  commercial  aircraft.  The  Corporation  structures  the  trusts  and  holds  a significant  residual  interest.  The  net  investment  represents  the  Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is nonrecourse to the Corporation.\n\nThe table below summarizes the maximum loss exposure and assets held by the Corporation  that  related  to  oth er  asset-backed  VIEs  at  December  3 1,  202 4  and 2023.\n\n## Other Asset-backed VIEs\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG held $11,715 million in corporate debt securities, which were valued using discounted cash flow techniques as revealed in 2024 disclosures. By 2024, the fair value of corporate debt had decreased to $177 million, with a weighted average yield of 9.22%, up from 7.39% in 2023. This indicates that AIG's corporate debt portfolio not only shrank significantly but also shifted toward higher-yielding instruments, which directly affected the valuation assumptions in their discounted cash flow models.",

      "question": "How did the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock at MA change from 2022 to 2024, and what implications does this have for shareholder influence given the fixed number of outstanding shares for each class?",
      "answer": "In 2022, holders of Class A common stock held approximately 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock represented 33 1/3% of the voting power. By 2024, the total number of issued and outstanding shares for both classes remained unchanged, with 1,404 shares of Class A and 7 shares of Class B issued and outstanding in 2024. Since the voting rights of Class A shares depend on the relative number of shares outstanding compared to Class B shares, and neither class changed in quantity, the proportional voting power distribution remained stable despite potential shifts in shareholder composition or equity value. However, the continued concentration of Class B shares under a single beneficial owner (Mr. Brian L. Roberts) preserved a structural imbalance in voting control.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MA(2022) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: MA disclosed the structure of Class A common stock, including its voting rights and the 66 2/3% voting power allocation.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The voting power of Class A shares is directly tied to the number of Class B shares outstanding, with Class B shares carrying 15 votes per share and representing 33 1/3% of the combined voting power.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 MA(2024): MA's 2024 filing confirms that the number of issued and outstanding Class B shares remained unchanged at 7 shares, matching the 2022 count."

      "question": "How did Mastercard's merchant dependency risks in 2023 contribute to regulatory pressures facing the company in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Mastercard (MA) identified a significant business risk stemming from its dependency on merchants and their influence in the global payments system. Specifically, the company noted that merchants and merchant-affiliated groups were actively lobbying for new legislation and seeking regulatory intervention to lower acceptance costs, particularly in jurisdictions like the U.S., Australia, Canada, and Europe. These efforts included attempts to reduce interchange fees, which are central to the revenue model for payment networks like Mastercard. If successful, such lobbying could have led to reduced issuer promotion of Mastercard products, diminished cardholder benefits, and lower transaction volumes. By 2024, these merchant-driven pressures materialized into tangible regulatory risks, as companies in the payments sector\u2014including Mastercard\u2014faced increasing legislative scrutiny and potential enforcement actions due to fraud incidents, cybersecurity concerns, and broader calls for enhanced security requirements. The 2024 filings specifically highlight that increased fraud levels and cyberattacks involving payment products could lead to legislative or regulatory intervention, which would heighten compliance costs and expose the company to greater liabilities. Thus, the merchant lobbying activities in 2023 laid the groundwork for the regulatory pressures Mastercard faced in 2024.",

        "Hop 1: MA(2023) \u2192 Merchants: Mastercard's 2023 filing explicitly states that merchants and affiliated groups were lobbying for regulatory intervention to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices.",
        "Hop 2: Merchants \u2192 Regulatory Intervention: Merchant lobbying efforts were aimed at influencing legislation and regulation, particularly around interchange fees and payment routing practices.",
        "Hop 3: Regulatory Intervention \u2190 MA(2024): By 2024, Mastercard acknowledged facing increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions stemming from systemic risks like fraud and cybersecurity, which were linked to merchant and third-party processor activities."

These  threats  also  may  be  further  enhanced  in  frequency  or effectiveness through threat actors' use of AI.\n\nOur operaEons rely on the secure transmission, storage and other processing of confidenEal, proprietary, sensiEve and personal informaEon and technology in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. Our customers and other parEes in the payments value chain, as well as account holders, rely on our digital technologies, computer systems, soVware and networks to conduct their operaEons.  In addiEon, to access our products and s e rvi ce s ,  our  cus tome rs   a nd  a ccount hol ders  i ncrea s i ngl y us e pers ona l  s ma rtphones , ta blet  PCs  a nd other mobile devices  tha t ma y be beyond our control. We, l i ke   othe r  fina nci a l   te chnol ogy orga ni za Eons , rouEnel y a re s ubject to cyber-threa ts  a nd our technologies , s ys tems  a nd networks , a s  well a s  the s ys tems  of our third-party  providers,  have  been  subject  to  aNempted  cyber-aNacks. Because  of  our  posiEon  in  the  payments  value  chain,  we  believe  that  we  are  likely  to conEnue to be a target of such threats and aNacks. GeopoliEcal events and resulEng government acEvity could also lead to informaEon security threats and attacks by affected or sympathizing jurisdictions or other actors, which could put our information and assets at risk, as well as result in network disruption.\n\nTo date, we have not experienced any material impact relaEng to cyber-aNacks or other informaEon security breaches.  However, future aNacks or breaches could l e a d to s e curi ty bre a che s  of the networks , s ys tems  (including third-pa rty provider s ys tems ) or devices  tha t our cus tomers  us e to a cces s  our products  a nd s ervices , which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destrucEon of confidenEal, proprietary, sensiEve and personal  informaEon  (including  account  data  informaEon)  or  data  security  compromises.  Such  aNacks  or  breaches  could  also  cause  service  interrupEons, malfuncEons  or  other  failures  in  the  physical  infrastructure,  networks  or  operaEons  systems  that  support  our  business  and  customers  (such  as  the  lack  of availability of our services), as well as the operaEons of our customers or other third parEes.  In addiEon, they could lead to damage to our reputaEon with our customers,  other  stakeholders  and  the  broader  payments  ecosystem,  addiEonal  costs  to  us  (such  as  repairing  systems,  adding  new  personnel  or  protecEon technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalEes, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. These consequences could be further pronounced in jurisdicEons in which we are deemed criEcal naEonal infrastructure.  If such aNacks are not detected immediately, or disclosed as required by law, their effect could be compounded.\n\nIn  a ddiEon to informaEon security risks for our systems and networks, we also rouEnely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transacEon data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of account holders. Further events of this type may subject us to reputaEonal damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands. Damage to our reputaEon or brands resulEng from an account data breach of our systems and networks or those of our customers, merchants and other third parEes could decrease the use and acceptance of our products and services. Such events could also slow or reverse the trend toward electronic payments. In addiEon to reputaEonal concerns, the cumulaEve impact of mulEple account data compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulEng from s uch events by, among other things, making it more difficult to idenEfy consumers.  Moreover, while most of the lawsuits resulEng from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could sEll face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operaEons.  While we offer security soluEons that are designed to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and cyberaNacks,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  security  soluEons  will  perform  as  expected  or  address  all  possible  security  threats.  Real  or  perceived  defects, failures, errors or vulnerabilities in our security solutions could adversely impact our reputation, customer confidence in our solutions and our business and may s ubject us to liEgaEon, governmental audits and invesEgaEon or other liabiliEes.  Such events could have a material adverse impact on our transacEon volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us.\n\nIn  a ddiEon,  companies  have  generally  experienced  in  recent  years  an  increase  in  fraudulent  acEvity  and  cyber-aNacks.  Criminals  are  using  increasingly s ophisEcated  methods  to  capture  consumer  personal  informaEon  to  engage  in  illegal  acEviEes  such  as  counterfeiEng  or  other  fraud  and  may  see  their effecEveness enhanced by the use of AI.  As outsourcing and specializaEon become common in the payments industry, there are more third parEes involved in processing transacEons using our payment products. We conEnue to take measures to make card and digital payments more secure. However, increased fraud l e ve l s   a nd  cybe r-a Na cks   i nvol vi ng  our  products ,  s e rvi ce s   a nd/or  ne twork,  or  mi s conduct  or  negl i gence  by  thi rd  pa rEes   s wi tchi ng  or  otherwis e  s ervi ci ng  our products  and  services  could  damage  our  reputaEon  and  reduce  the  use  and  acceptance  of  our  products  and  services  and/or  increase  our  compliance  costs. Further, such occurrences have resulted in and could further result in legislaEve or regulatory intervenEon, which could lead to enhanced security requirements and liabilities. See 'Risk Factors - Privacy, Data ProtecEon, AI and InformaEon Security Compliance' in this Part I, Item 1A for more detail concerning related legal ri s ks  a nd obl i ga ti ons .\n\nDespite various miEgaEon efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we, or third parEes with which we work, will not suffer material breaches and resulEng losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage, such coverage may not be adequate to protect us from such losses as well as any l i a b i l i Ee s   o r  d a ma ge s   wi th  re s pe ct  to  cl a i ms   a l l e gi ng  compromi s e s   of  our  confide nEa l ,  propri e ta ry,  s e ns i Eve   or  pe rs ona l   i nforma Eon  or  our  te chnol ogi e s , s ys te ms  or networks.

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife held $9.949 billion in CMBS investments, which are defined as securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans. By 2024, this exposure translated into direct credit challenges, as $182 million in previously extended commercial mortgage loans became delinquent and were foreclosed within 12 months of modification. This indicates a migration from indirect CMBS exposure to direct credit deterioration in the commercial mortgage loan portfolio, signaling increased credit risk realization.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that stress testing included various scenarios of potential early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal risk, which was monitored daily through a rolling 12-month liquidity forecast and adjusted via asset mix and maturity changes. By 2024, MetLife's risk assessment evolved to include cybersecurity threats, which were quantified through annual internal and third-party risk assessments, continuous monitoring of critical vendors, and periodic network/application testing. While the 2022 stress testing focused on liquidity and withdrawal scenarios using cash flow projections, the 2024 risk assessment incorporated a broader, threat-centric framework that included measurable controls like penetration testing, incident response exercises, and vendor risk scoring. Both approaches reflect MetLife's risk-based methodology but show a clear temporal evolution from financial scenario modeling to operational and digital risk quantification.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## The Company\n\n## Liquidity\n\nLiquidity refers  to  the  ability  to  generate  adequate  amounts  of  cash  to  meet  our  needs. We  determine  our  liquidity  needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. We adjust the asset mix and asset maturities  based  on  this  rolling  12-month  forecast.  To  support  this  forecast,  we  conduct  cash  flow  and  stress  testing,  which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities.\n\nUnder certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. A downgrade in our credit or financial strength ratings could also negatively affect our liquidity. See '- Rating Agencies.'  If  we  require  significant  amounts  of  cash  on  short  notice  in  excess  of  anticipated  cash  requirements  or  if  we  are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, for securities in an unrealized loss position, realized losses would be incurred on securities sold and impairments would be incurred, if there is a need to sell securities prior to recovery, which may negatively impact  our  financial  condition.  See  'Risk  Factors  -  Investment  Risks  -  We  May  Have  Difficulty  Selling  Holdings  in  Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value.'\n\nAll general account assets within a particular legal entity - other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose - are generally available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity.\n\n## Capital\n\nWe  manage  our  capital  position  to  maintain  our  financial  strength  and  credit  ratings.  See  '-  Rating  Agencies'  for information  regarding  such  ratings.  Our  capital  position  is  supported  by  our  ability  to  generate  strong  cash  flows  within  our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.\n\n## Statutory Capital and Dividends\n\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements.\n\nRBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an  early  warning  regulatory  tool  to  identify  possible  inadequately  capitalized  insurers  for  purposes  of  initiating  regulatory action,  and  not  as  a  means  to  rank  insurers  generally.  These  rules  apply  to  most  of  our  U.S.  insurance  subsidiaries.  State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial  statements  filed  with  insurance  regulators,  the  total  adjusted  capital  of  each  of  these  subsidiaries  subject  to  these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, American Life is subject to Delaware law; however, because it does not conduct insurance business  in  Delaware  or  any  other  U.S.  state,  it  is  exempt  from  RBC  requirements  under  Delaware  law.  American  Life's operations are also regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions  in  which  it  operates  and  is  subject  to  capital  and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions.",

AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nCorporate  Treasury  is  responsible  for  our  aggregated  interest  rate  risk, including  assessing  and  monitoring  EaR  and  EVE  sensitivity,  and  interest rate risk stress tests and assumptions.\n\nRisk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk  officer,  has  primary  responsibility  for  assessing,  monitoring  and managing  our  interest  rate  risk  (including  EaR  and  EVE  sensitivity)  by providing independent firmwide oversight and challenge across our global businesses.\n\nStress  Testing. Stress  testing  is  a  method  of  determining  the  effect  of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures.  We  use  a  variety  of  stress  testing  techniques  to  calculate  the potential  loss  from  a  wide  range  of  market  moves  on  our  portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The  results  of  our  various  stress  tests  are  analyzed  together  for  risk management purposes. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nSensitivity  analysis  is  used  to  quantify  the  impact  of  a  market  move  in  a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected  over  a  one-day  time  horizon  up  to  those  that  could  take  many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the  default  of  any  single  entity,  which  captures  the  risk  of  large  or concentrated exposures.\n\nScenario  analysis  is  used  to  quantify  the  impact  of  a  specified  event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress.  When conducting  scenario  analysis,  we  often  consider  a  number  of  possible outcomes  for  each  scenario,  ranging  from  moderate  to  severely  adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.\n\nUnlike V aR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated  at  a  specified  confidence  level,  there  may  not  be  an  implied probability  that  our  stress  testing  scenarios  will  occur.  Instead,  stress testing  is  used  to  model  both  moderate  and  more  extreme  moves  in underlying  market  factors.  When  estimating  potential  loss,  we  generally assume  that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).\n\n## Limits\n\nWe  use  market  risk  limits  at  various  levels  to  manage  the  size  of  our market exposures. These limits are set based on V aR, EaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval process.\n\nLimits are monitored by Corporate Treasury and Risk. Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk  committee,  on  a  timely  basis,  instances  where  limits  have  been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such  as  increased  volatilities  or  changes  in  correlations).  Such  instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe analyze V aR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including  by  risk  category,  business  and  region.  Diversification  effect  in the tables below represents the difference between total V aR and the sum of  the  V aRs  for  the  four  risk  categories.  This  effect  arises  because  the four  market  risk  categories  are  not  perfectly  correlated.  Substantially  all positions in VaR are included within Global Banking &amp; Markets.\n\nThe table below presents our average daily VaR.\n\n",

Cybersecurity\n\n## Cybersecurity Management &amp; Strategy\n\nWe manage information security risk through, and as part of, MetLife's Information Security Program (the 'Program'), instituted to maintain controls for the systems, applications, and databases of the Company and of its third-party providers. The primary goal of the Program is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all data MetLife owns or possesses, as well as its technology assets, through physical, technical, and administrative safeguards. This includes controls and procedures across business units and at the enterprise level for monitoring, detecting, reporting, containing, managing, and remediating cyber threats. The Program aims to prevent data exfiltration, manipulation, and destruction, as well as system and transactional disruption. The Program's threat-centric and risk-based approach for securing the MetLife environment takes into consideration applicable guidelines from the cybersecurity framework developed by the U.S. G overnment's National Institute of Standards and Technology along with the sensitivity of the systems and the potential severity of the associated risks to MetLife and its relevant lines of business, and is managed by MetLife's CISO, collaborating with lines of business and corporate functions. Our Board of Directors oversees the Program.\n\nThe key features of the Program include:\n\n- A cybersecurity incident response team under the CISO's direction, which is responsible for monitoring and responding to threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.\n- An incident response plan that is managed by the CISO and the Chief Privacy Officer and tested through cross-functional annual exercises in various geographical regions of the Company, many of which include participation from senior executives and the Board of Directors.\n- Information security policies and procedures that are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect applicable changes in law, technology, practice and emerging threats.\n- Regular network and application testing and surveillance.\n- Periodic review of threats, vulnerabilities and other cybersecurity risks, internal and ex ternal.\n- Risk mitigation strategies, including annual internal and third-party risk assessments, as well as cybersecurity and privacy liability insurance intended to defray costs associated with an information security breach.\n- Vendor management procedures designed to identify and address potential risks associated with the use of third-party service providers.\n- Employee training programs on information security, data security, and cybersecurity practices and protection of data against cyber threats, at least annually.\n- A cross-functional approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, with participation from  G lobal  Technology &amp;  Operations,  Risk,  Compliance,  Legal,  Privacy and Internal Audit functions.\n\nWe exercise risk-based due diligence in selecting our third-party service providers, including, as appropriate, review of vendor applications, general IT controls and the IT facilities used to service MetLife's business. Third parties are governed by the MetLife Third-Party Risk Management program, which includes risk assessment prior to onboarding. Based on the assessment of risk, certain third-party service providers must periodically update relevant assessment documentation and be reevaluated by MetLife relative to their internal controls. V endors deemed critical and high risk are continuously monitored by various industry solutions and services designed to identify cybersecurity risks.\n\nWe also work with third parties, such as independent assessors (for example, for industry maturity assessments, penetration testing, application security reviews, and independent audits), external legal counsel and other consultants as part of the design and implementation of the Program. The Program is periodically evaluated by external experts, and the results of those reviews are reported to the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, we have not identified risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect MetLife, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For further discussion of MetLife's risks related to cybersecurity, see 'Risk Factors - Operational Risks - We May Fail to Protect the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of Our Systems or Data, Including As a Result of a Failure in Our Cybersecurity or Other Information Security Systems or Our Disaster Recovery Plans or Those of Our Vendors.'",

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG had a $125 million affiliated reinsurance arrangement subject to reimbursement by Corebridge Parent, indicating a reliance on internal capital mechanisms to meet statutory reserve requirements, which required evaluation under risk transfer criteria to determine if reinsurance accounting applied. By 2024, AIG's reinsurance transactions with Fortitude Re were structured using modified coinsurance (modco) and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld, suggesting a shift toward more formalized third-party risk transfer mechanisms. This evolution indicates a strategic move from internal affiliated support to externalized reinsurance structures that better satisfy risk transfer requirements under U.S. GAAP, as evidenced by the discontinuation of reliance on the Corebridge-backed letter of credit and the introduction of modco arrangements designed to transfer both underwriting and timing risk.",

In addition, our subsidiaries have pledged securities available for sale with a fair v alue of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nInvestments held in escrow accounts or otherwise subject to restriction as to their use were $73 million and $164 million, comprised of bonds available for sale and short-term investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nReinsurance transactions between AIG and Fortitude Re were structured as modified coinsurance (modco) and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld.\n\n## 7. Lending Activities\n\nMortgage and other loans receivable include commercial mortgages, life insurance policy loans, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable. Commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances less allowance for credit losses and plus or minus adjustments for the accretion or amortization of discount or premium. Interest income on such loans is accrued as earned.\n\nDirect costs of originating commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable, net of nonrefundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of the related receivables. The amount deferred is amortized to income as an adjustment to earnings using the interest method.\n\nLife insurance policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. There is no allowance for policy loans because these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy.\n\nThe following table presents the composition of Mortgage and other loans receivable, net:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the increase in SCHW's repurchase agreements from $0 in 2022 to $5.5 billion in 2024 correlate with CSC's shift away from unsecured committed credit lines and what does this suggest about the company's evolving liquidity funding mix?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SCHW had no repurchase agreements outstanding, while CSC maintained access to a $2.1 billion unsecured committed revolving line of credit that was available in 2024 (but not drawn). By 2024, SCHW had $5.5 billion in repurchase agreements collateralized by investment securities, while CSC's unsecured committed line expired and was not renewed. This shift suggests that as SCHW increased its use of secured funding through repurchase agreements, CSC reduced its reliance on formal unsecured committed credit facilities, possibly relying instead on the broader secured liquidity sources available through SCHW's balance sheet. This indicates a strategic shift toward collateralized funding mechanisms across the corporate structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SCHW(2022) \u2192 Repurchase Agreements: No repurchase agreements were outstanding in 2022, indicating limited use of this secured funding mechanism at that time.",
        "Hop 2: Repurchase Agreements \u2192 CSC: Repurchase agreements became a significant source of short-term liquidity for SCHW by 2024, potentially influencing CSC's own funding strategy.",
        "Hop 3: CSC \u2190 SCHW(2024): CSC's unsecured committed revolving credit facility expired in January 2025 without renewal, and no amounts were drawn in 2024, suggesting a strategic shift away from this funding source."

The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin lending activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.\n\nWe employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at certain subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.\n\n## Primary Funding Sources\n\nSchwab's primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients.\n\nOther sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.\n\nTo meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.\n\n## Additional Funding Sources\n\nIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interestearning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements, and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.\n\nThe following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2021:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Management of Climate Risk and ESG\n\nClimate risk has come under increased scrutiny by regulators and the NAIC. In New Y ork, the NYDFS expects both New Y ork domestic insurers, such as MLIC, and foreign authorized insurers, such as our other insurance subsidiaries licensed in New Y ork, to manage material climate risks by taking actions that are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of their businesses. However, the NYDFS issued separate guidance for New Y ork domestic insurers, which contains more detailed expectations, such as (i) ensuring the board of directors understands relevant climate risks; (ii) performing regular reviews of the insurer's procedures that are designed to manage climate risks;  (iii)  using  scenario  analysis  to  inform  the  insurer's  business  strategies  and  risk  assessment;  and  (iv)  incorporating  material  climate  risks  into  its  financial  risk management (e.g., ERM and ORSA). In addition, New Y ork's regulation governing ERM, which applies to New Y ork domestic and foreign authorized insurers, was amended to require an insurance group's ERM function to address climate change risk.\n\nThe NAIC has adopted a standard for insurance companies to report their climate-related risks as part of its annual Climate Risk Disclosure Survey, which applies to insurers that meet the reporting threshold of $100 million in countrywide direct premium and are licensed in one of the participating jurisdictions. The new disclosure standard is consistent with the international Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures' framework for reporting climate-related financial information.\n\nPursuant to its authority under Dodd-Frank, the FIO is also assessing how the insurance sector may mitigate climate risks and help achieve national climate-related goals.  In  2023,  the  FIO  released  a  report  which  urges  insurance  regulators  to  adopt  climate-related  risk-monitoring  guidance  in  order  to  enhance  their  regulation  and supervision of insurers.\n\nThe SEC is also focused on climate, and environmental, social and governance ('ESG ') risks and opportunities. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring registrants to provide additional climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports, including in their financial statements. In April 2024, following litigation  challenging  the  final  rules,  the  SEC  voluntarily  stayed  the  final  rules  pending  completion  of  judicial  review .  In  2022,  the  SEC  also  proposed  rules  requiring registered investment companies, business development companies, and registered and certain unregistered investment advisers to disclose in their fund prospectuses, annual reports and Form ADV information about how funds and advisers incorporate ESG factors into their investment strategies.\n\nIn 2023, California adopted laws establishing climate disclosure and climate-related financial risk reporting requirements which apply to companies doing business in California that meet applicable revenue thresholds. Also in 2023, California adopted a law establishing disclosure requirements for entities operating within California that market, sell, purchase, or use voluntary carbon offsets, as well as those that make claims of achieving net zero emissions or carbon neutrality that operate within and make such claims within the state. MetLife is in compliance with such requirements.\n\nThe EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD') requires in-scope companies to report on (i) how sustainability issues might create financial risks for the company; and (ii) the company's impacts on people and the environment. CSRD applies on a staggered basis to companies, over a multi-year period, with the first reports due in 2025 in respect of the 2024 financial year. MetLife's largest insurance subsidiary in Europe is in scope for this first phase.\n\n## Consumer Protection Laws\n\nAs part of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ('CFPB') to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction generally exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate non-insurance consumer services we provide. Consumer protection laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions may also affect us.\n\n## Derivatives Regulation and Clearing of Treasury Securities\n\nDodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of the over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives markets requiring clearing of certain  OTC derivative transactions and imposes additional costs, including reporting and margin requirements. Centralized clearing also exposes us to the risk of a default by a clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions.",

      "question": "How did the voting power dynamics between MA's Class A and Class B common stock change from 2022 to 2023, and what implications did this have for shareholder influence based on the disclosed stock structures in each year?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MA disclosed the structure of its Class A and Class B common stock, which established a dual-class voting system where Class A shares held 66 2/3% and Class B shares held 33 1/3% of the total voting power, with Class B shares convertible to Class A on a one-to-one basis. By 2023, MA's filing indicated that while Class A shares had a public market value of $328.8 billion and were widely held (925.7 million shares outstanding), Class B shares\u2014without a public trading market\u2014remained tightly held with only 7.2 million shares outstanding. The non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power of Class B shares meant that despite their small number, they retained significant influence over corporate decisions. This suggests that the voting power concentration remained stable or possibly increased due to the lack of conversion activity, reinforcing the control of Class B shareholders over strategic outcomes.",

      "question": "How did the change in AXP's regulatory leverage ratio requirements between 2022 and 2023 influence AENB's ability to distribute dividends, particularly in light of AENB's $3.6 billion dividend payout to AXP in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AXP was subject to Federal Reserve leverage ratio requirements, which mandated minimum Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on-balance sheet assets, and AENB was under the supervision of the OCC with similar capital adequacy requirements. These regulatory constraints meant that AENB could not distribute dividends if it failed to meet these capital thresholds. By 2023, AENB paid a dividend of $3.6 billion to AXP from retained earnings, indicating that it remained in compliance with those requirements. However, the 2023 regulatory language emphasized stricter oversight, including graduated constraints on dividends if risk-based capital ratios fell below minimum regulatory requirements. This suggests that while AENB maintained sufficient capital to allow for a large dividend in 2023, the regulatory environment had become more explicit about limiting such distributions if capital adequacy deteriorated, reflecting a more cautious stance from regulators.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AXP(2022) \u2192 Leverage Ratio Requirements: AXP and its subsidiary AENB were required to maintain minimum leverage ratios under Federal Reserve and OCC regulations.",
        "Hop 2: Leverage Ratio Requirements \u2192 AENB: AENB\u2019s ability to pay dividends was directly tied to maintaining these capital adequacy standards, with restrictions in place if capital ratios fell below required levels.",
        "Hop 3: AENB \u2190 AXP(2023): In 2023, AENB paid a $3.6 billion dividend to AXP, indicating it met the regulatory capital requirements despite a more explicitly restrictive regulatory tone."

      "answer": "MET's 2022 disclosures indicate that management applied considerable judgment in selecting assumptions for embedded derivative liabilities, including mortality, lapse, withdrawal, and risk-free rates, which were subject to audit scrutiny due to their complexity and sensitivity to market conditions. In 2023, MET disclosed that real estate funds were valued using NAV-based models that incorporated unobservable inputs, particularly for long-term private investments with terms of 8\u201310 years. The LMT_10k_2023 evidence shows that real estate fund valuations relied on periodic appraisals and valuation models similar to those used for private equity, suggesting a continued reliance on judgment-intensive methods. This indicates that MET's risk modeling practices remained consistent in their reliance on complex, assumption-driven models across different asset classes, though the shift from observable market inputs in derivatives to unobservable inputs in real estate may signal increased model risk in 2023.",

The audit effort included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, including our actuarial specialists, to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  the  assumptions  used  to  determine  the  estimate  of  future  policy  benefits  for  long-term  care insurance, included, among others, the following:\n\n- We tested  the  effectiveness  of  the  control  over  the  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation  of  future  policy  benefits  and  the effectiveness of the controls over the underlying data.\n- With the involvement of our actuarial specialists, we:\n- evaluated judgments applied by management in setting principal assumptions, including evaluating the results of experience studies used as the basis for setting those assumptions.\n- evaluated management's estimate of, or developed an independent estimate of, future policy benefits, on a sample basis, and evaluated differences. This included confirming that assumptions were applied as intended.\n- evaluated the results of the Company's annual premium deficiency tests.\n\n## Derivatives - Valuation of Embedded Derivative Liabilities - Refer to Notes 1, 4, 9, and 10 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Company's  products  include  variable  annuity  contracts  with  guaranteed  minimum  benefits  that  provide  the  policyholder  a minimum return based on their initial deposit adjusted for withdrawals. The guarantees on variable annuity contracts are accounted for as insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on how and when the benefit is paid. Guarantees accounted for as embedded  derivatives  include  the  non-life  contingent  portion  of  guaranteed  minimum  withdrawal  benefits  and  certain  non-life contingent portions of guaranteed minimum income benefits, and are recorded in policyholder account balances on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Embedded derivatives are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract using actuarial and capital market assumptions that are updated annually. Management's estimate of embedded derivative liabilities was $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\nManagement applies considerable judgment in selecting assumptions used to estimate embedded derivative liabilities and changes in  market  conditions  or  variations  in  certain  assumptions  could  result  in  significant  fluctuations  in  the  estimate.  Principal assumptions  include  mortality,  lapse,  dynamic  lapse,  withdrawal,  utilization,  and  risk-free  rates  and  implied  volatilities.  The valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities is also based on complex calculations which are data intensive.\n\nGiven  the  inherent  uncertainty  in  selecting  assumptions  and  the  complexity  of  the  calculations,  we  have  determined  that management's valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities is a critical audit matter which required a high degree of auditor judgment  and  an  increased  extent  of  effort  when  performing  audit  procedures  to  evaluate  the  judgments  made  and  the reasonableness  of  the  models  and  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation.

      "answer": "In 2022, V's Class B Common Stock had a conversion rate of 1.6059 into Class A Common Stock, resulting in 394 million as-converted shares. By 2024, the conversion rate increased slightly to 1.6228, although the number of outstanding Class B shares dropped significantly from 245 million to 125 million. This indicates a strategic reduction in the Class B share base, which may reflect a broader shift in the company's ownership structure or voting power distribution, while maintaining a consistent but slightly enhanced conversion mechanism.",

        "Hop 1: V(2022) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: In 2022, V disclosed 245 million Class B shares with a conversion rate of 1.6059 into Class A shares, resulting in 394 million as-converted shares.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The conversion mechanism links Class B to Class A shares, with the conversion rate determining the equivalence in voting and economic power.",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, MET's Collateralized Mortgage Obligations had an estimated fair value of $17,646 million with net unrealized gains of $1,092 million, representing 58.0% of the total RMBS portfolio. By 2024, the RMBS portfolio had grown significantly, with Structured Products (including RMBS) reaching $63.7 billion in estimated fair value. The RMBS portfolio remained diversified, including both collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities, with continued exposure to varying risk profiles such as Agency, Prime, Alt-A, and Sub-prime. This indicates a strategic expansion and ongoing emphasis on structured products, particularly within the RMBS segment, while maintaining a diversified risk profile.",

See Note 5 - Segment Information for the presentation of the Registrant's revenue disaggregation.\n\n## 5. Segment Information (All Registrants)\n\nOperating  segments  for  each  of  the  Registrants  are  determined  based  on  information  used  by  the  CODM  in  deciding  how  to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.\n\nExelon  has  eleven  reportable  segments,  which  includes  five  reportable  segments  for  Generation  consisting  of  the  Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and all other power regions referred to     collectively as 'Other Power Regions' and ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI's three reportable segments consisting of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each represent a single reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE's CODMs evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE based on net income.\n\nThe  basis  for  the  reportable  segments  of  Generation  is  the  integrated  management  of  Generation's  electricity  business  that  is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple  supply  sources  to  provide  electricity  through  various  distribution  channels  (wholesale  and  retail).  Generation's  hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of the five reportable segments of Generation are as follows:\n\n- Mid-Atlantic represents  operations  in  the  eastern  half  of  PJM,  which  includes  New  Jersey,  Maryland,  Virginia,  West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\n- Midwest represents operations in the western half of PJM and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding MISO's Southern Region.\n- New York represents operations within NYISO.\n- ERCOT represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas that covers a majority of the state of Texas.\n- Other Power Regions:\n- New England represents operations within ISO-NE.\n- South represents  operations  in  the  FRCC,  MISO's  Southern  Region,  and  the  remaining  portions  of  the  SERC  not included within MISO or PJM.\n- West represents operations in the WECC, which includes CAISO.\n- Canada represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO, and the Canadian portion of MISO.\n\nThe CODM evaluates the performance of Generation's electric business activities and allocates resources based on Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense (RNF). Management believes that RNF is a useful",

      "answer": "In 2023, BlackRock was required to maintain approximately $1.8 billion in net capital for its regulated subsidiaries, including BlackRock Execution Services, which are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In 2024, this requirement remained unchanged at $1.8 billion, indicating stable regulatory capital pressure on these broker-dealer entities despite potential shifts in market or regulatory conditions. This flat requirement contrasts with the $2.2 billion requirement in 2022, suggesting a recalibration of capital expectations by regulators or a change in the firm's risk profile in prior years.",

This risk exposure likely influenced MET\u2019s cautious approach to mortgage-backed securities in 2023. Specifically, MET's investment in pass-through mortgage-backed securities increased from $10.89 billion in 2022 to $12.39 billion in 2023 in estimated fair value. However, unrealized losses on these securities also increased from $(1,414) million in 2022 to $(1,114) million in 2023, indicating continued sensitivity to market volatility and credit spread movements. The connection between mortgage loans and pass-through securities\u2014where the latter are secured by the former\u2014shows how earlier risks in the underlying asset class directly shaped later investment performance and strategic allocation decisions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Credit Spread Risks\n\nChanges in credit spreads may result in market price volatility and cash flow variability. Market price volatility can make valuations  of  our  securities  difficult  if  trading  becomes  less  frequent,  which  may  require  us  to  add  to  our  reserves.  Market volatility may cause changes in credit spreads, defaults and a lack of pricing transparency. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income. A sustained decrease in credit spreads could reduce the yield on our future investments.\n\n## Equity Risks\n\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products' revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products' revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\n\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other postretirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps ('TRRs'), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\n\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds' need for cash. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.\n\n## Real Estate Risks\n\nChanges in leasable commercial space supply and demand, pandemics and other public health issues, creditworthiness of tenants  and  partners,  capital  markets  volatility,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  commodity  prices,  farm  incomes,  housing  and commercial property market conditions, and real estate investment supply and demand may adversely impact our investments in commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and real estate and real estate joint ventures.\n\n## Obligor and Counterparty Risks\n\nOur general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting from local economic and political concerns, as well as volatility in specific sectors. Government entities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such governments.\n\nThe  issuers  or  guarantors  of  fixed  income  securities  and  mortgage  loans  we  own  may  default  on  principal  and  interest payments  they  owe  us.  Additionally,  the  change  in  value  of  underlying  collateral  within  asset-backed  securities  ('ABS'), including mortgage-backed securities, may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may reduce the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and increase the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio.\n\nMany  of  our  transactions  with  counterparties  such  as  brokers  and  dealers,  central  clearinghouses,  commercial  banks, investment banks, hedge funds, investment funds, reinsurers and other financial institutions expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize on the collateral held by us in secured transactions or cannot liquidate such collateral at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Furthermore, potential  action  by  governments  and  regulatory  bodies,  such  as  controlling  investment,  nationalization,  conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks' credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. These may cause losses or impairments to the carrying value of our investments.\n\nOur efforts to manage our total exposure to a single counterparty or limited number of counterparties within or among any of our investment, derivative, treasury, and reinsurance relationships, which we adjust from time to time, may not completely or adequately mitigate counterparty risks.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG recorded impairments on real estate investments that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, indicating challenges in accurately valuing these assets (AIG_10k_2022.pdf). In response, AIG strengthened its NAV validation processes by 2023, implementing additional control procedures to ensure the accuracy of NAV inputs and valuation techniques, including comparisons of prices from multiple sources and independent reviews by experts (AIG_10k_2023.pdf). This evolution was likely influenced by industry recognition, as seen in UPS's 2023 disclosures, that NAV-based valuations for real estate investments carry inherent limitations due to the lack of readily available market data and the reliance on audited financial reports from partnerships. AIG\u2019s enhanced validation framework in 2023 directly addressed the risks highlighted by both its 2022 impairments and the broader industry\u2019s cautious use of NAV for such assets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard expressed concern that fintechs, despite being partners, could develop platforms that disintermediate the company from digital payments, especially if those relationships involved sharing anonymized Mastercard data that could provide a competitive advantage. By 2023, this risk persisted, with an emphasis on heightened data-sharing risks during fintech partnerships, where improper oversight could enable fintechs to build competing infrastructures or services that diminish demand for Mastercard's offerings. The evolution shows a continued but more nuanced concern around data-sharing practices and fintechs\u2019 potential to build competitive platforms despite ongoing strategic partnerships.",

By 2024, the company explicitly referenced an in-force block of assumed variable annuity guarantees from a third party, indicating a shift from purely internal risk management to taking on external reinsurance obligations. This evolution shows that MetLife expanded its exposure to variable annuity guarantees through reinsurance arrangements, increasing both the complexity and scale of their liability management as reflected in the 2024 financial statements under the Reinsurance note.",

The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\n\nThese guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions, including changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to noncapital market inputs, impact the estimated fair value of the guarantees and affect net income, and changes in nonperformance risk of the Company affect OCI.\n\n## MetLife Holdings - Annuities\n\nThe MetLife Holdings segment's variable annuity products offer contract features where the Company guarantees to the contractholder a minimum benefit, which includes guaranteed minimum death benefits ('GMDBs') and living benefit guarantees. The GMDB contract features include return of premium, which provides a return of the purchase payment upon death, annual step-up and roll-up and step-up combinations. The living benefit guarantees contract features primarily include guaranteed minimum income benefits ('GMIBs'), which provide a minimum accumulation of purchase payments that can be annuitized to receive a monthly income stream, and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ('GMWBs'), which provide a series of withdrawals, provided that withdrawals in a contract year do not exceed a contractual limit.

      "answer": "In 2023, MS disclosed that Level 3 valuations, which rely on unobservable inputs, required the greatest degree of judgment and often involved reclassification due to market dislocation, with valuation adjustments for liquidity risk, credit quality, model uncertainty, and concentration risk. The Firm used pricing models that incorporated contract terms and multiple inputs such as commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, and option volatility. In 2024, MS continued to apply pricing models for Level 3 valuations but placed greater emphasis on reflecting market participant assumptions even when market data was not readily available. The Firm also maintained its use of valuation adjustments, particularly for liquidity and credit risk, and continued to simulate future exposure distributions for OTC derivatives using market-based default probabilities. The evolution shows a consistent but refined approach to handling unobservable inputs, with increased focus on modeling market participant behavior under uncertain conditions.",

Therefore,  even when  market  assumptions  are  not  readily  available,  assumptions  are  set  to reflect those that the Firm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Where the Firm manages a group of financial assets, financial liabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives on the basis of its net ex posure to either market risks or credit risk, the  Firm  measures  the  fair  value  of  that  group  of  financial  instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.\n\nIn  determining  fair  value,  the  Firm  uses  various  valuation  approaches  and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs be used when available.\n\nObservable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset  or  liability  that  were  developed  based  on  market  data  obtained  from sources independent of the Firm. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the Firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows, with Level 1 being the highest and Level 3 being the lowest level:\n\nLevel 1. V aluations based on quoted prices in active markets that the Firm has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. V aluation adjustments, block discounts and discounts for entity-specific and contractual restrictions that  would  not  transfer  to  market  participants  are  not  applied  to  Level  1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.\n\nLevel 2. V aluations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active  markets,  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  assets  or  liabilities  in inactive markets, significant market inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or market-corroborated inputs.\n\nLevel 3. V aluations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product. To the extent that valuation is based on models  or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of  fair  value  requires  more  judgment. Accordingly,  the  degree  of  judgment exercised  by  the  Firm  in  determining  fair  value  is  greatest  for  instruments categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe Firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date,  including  during  periods  of  market  dislocation.  In  periods  of  market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nIn  certain  cases,  the  inputs  used  to  measure  fair  value  may  fall  into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value of the asset or liability.\n\n## Valuation Techniques\n\nMany cash instruments and OTC derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. The Firm carries positions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. For offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.\n\nFair value for many cash instruments and OTC derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. Pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the Firm, option volatility and currency rates.\n\nWhere  appropriate,  valuation  adjustments  are  made  to  account  for  various factors  such  as  liquidity  risk  (bid-ask  adjustments),  credit  quality,  model uncertainty, and concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. Adjustments  for  liquidity  risk  adjust  model-derived  mid-market  amounts  of Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect the ex it price of a risk position. Bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external  third-party  data.  Where  these  spreads  are  unobservable  for  the particular position in question, spreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.\n\nThe  Firm  applies  credit-related  valuation  adjustments  to  its  Borrowings  for which  the  fair  value  option  was  elected  and  to  OTC  derivatives.  The  Firm considers  the  impact  of  changes  in  its  own  credit  spreads  based  upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value for Borrowings.",
