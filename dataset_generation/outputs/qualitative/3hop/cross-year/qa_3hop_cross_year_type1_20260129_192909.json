      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' investment strategy in APLNG from 2022 to 2023 influence its production and ownership stake in coal bed methane (CBM) in Queensland, Australia?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% stake in APLNG, increasing its ownership and resulting in a $688 million write-down due to fair value adjustments. By 2023, ConocoPhillips held a 47.5% ownership stake in APLNG, which is focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland. APLNG, in turn, is responsible for producing CBM that feeds into LNG operations on Curtis Island. Therefore, the increased investment in APLNG in 2022 directly supported COP's expanded role in CBM production through 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil held a 69.6% stake in Imperial Oil Limited, which in turn held a 25% interest in Syncrude, resulting in an indirect stake of approximately 17.4% in Syncrude. By 2024, the structure remained unchanged, with ExxonMobil still holding 69.6% of Imperial Oil Limited, which maintained its 25% stake in Syncrude. The company's share of net production from Syncrude also remained constant at 62 thousand barrels per day in both years. This indicates a stable upstream strategy in oil sands production, with no changes in ownership structure or production levels through the Syncrude joint venture.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron's net oil-equivalent production declined by 47,000 barrels per day, or 3%, partly due to the expiration of the Erawan concession in Thailand. Despite this decline, Chevron maintained operations in Thailand through its Map Ta Phut refinery, which saw an increase in refinery crude unit inputs to 160 thousand barrels per day in 2024, up from 153 thousand barrels per day in 2023. This indicates that while upstream production was negatively affected by the concession expiration, downstream refining activity in Thailand continued to grow.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron reported a $4,500 million loan to Tengizchevroil (TCO) to fund the Future Growth Project and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP/WPMP) in Kazakhstan, indicating a strong capital commitment to the joint venture. By 2023, Chevron had spent approximately $2.5 billion in Asia, primarily for development projects at TCO in Kazakhstan, showing a continued focus on expanding production capacity. Additionally, as of year-end 2023, Chevron reported that 511 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves at TCO were scheduled for development in alignment with reservoir depletion and facility constraints, reflecting a strategic shift toward long-term reserve conversion and operational optimization following earlier capital-intensive phases.",

At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\n\nPetroboscan Chevron  has  a  39.2  percent  interest  in  Petroboscan,  a  joint  stock  company  which  operates  the  Boscan  Field  in Venezuela.  In  2020,  the  company  fully  impaired  its  investments  in  the  Petroboscan  affiliate  and,  effective  July  1,  2020,  began accounting  for  this  venture  as  a  non-equity  method  investment.  The  company  also  has  an  outstanding  long-term  loan  to Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola  LNG Limited Chevron  has  a  36.4  percent  interest  in Angola  LNG  Limited,  which  processes  and  liquefies  natural  gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.",

      "question": "How did Exxon Mobil's stake in Imperial Oil Limited influence the change in Syncrude's synthetic crude oil production share between 2022 and 2024?",
      "answer": "Exxon Mobil's 69.6% stake in Imperial Oil Limited remained constant from 2022 to 2024, which maintained its indirect 25% interest in Syncrude. Despite no change in ownership structure, the company's share of net production of synthetic crude oil from Syncrude stayed flat at 62 thousand barrels per day across both years. This stability in production levels suggests that operational performance or upstream resource availability did not significantly change during this period, even as other assets like Kearl saw production increases (from 251 to 262 thousand barrels per day).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM(2022) \u2192 Syncrude: XOM indirectly held a 25% interest in Syncrude through its 69.6% ownership of Imperial Oil Limited, with a production share of 62 thousand barrels per day in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Syncrude \u2192 Imperial Oil Limited: Syncrude is a joint venture where Imperial Oil Limited directly owns 25%, and XOM indirectly controls this stake via its ownership in Imperial Oil Limited.",
        "Hop 3: Imperial Oil Limited \u2190 XOM(2024): In 2024, XOM still held a 69.6% interest in Imperial Oil Limited, which continued to own 25% of Syncrude, resulting in the same 62 thousand barrels per day production share as in 2022."

      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips held a 30% stake in QatarEnergy LNG N3 (N3), which was part of its broader LNG portfolio in Qatar's North Field. By 2024, the company was indirectly involved in QatarEnergy LNG N4 (N4), a joint venture between QatarEnergy and Shell, through the integrated development of offshore assets and shared LNG processing facilities. This indirect involvement in N4, despite not being a direct equity holder, suggests that ConocoPhillips' role in the North Field LNG expansion evolved from a direct equity participant in N3 to a de facto contributor to the broader integrated LNG infrastructure through its continued stake in N3 and the mutualized production model with N4. This evolution reflects a strategic alignment in the development of Qatar\u2019s LNG export capacity.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 QatarEnergy LNG N3: COP held a 30% equity stake in N3 in 2023, which included upstream gas production and a 7.8 million tonnes/year LNG facility.",

      "answer": "Chevron's carrying value difference for its Tengizchevroil investment decreased from $100 million in 2022 to $73 million in 2024, indicating a narrowing of the premium Chevron paid over the book value of Tengizchevroil\u2019s net assets. This change occurred despite Chevron continuing to fund major development projects in Kazakhstan, such as the Future Growth Project and Wellhead Pressure Management Project, which maintained a loan balance of $4,500 million in both years. The reduction in the carrying value difference suggests either a revaluation of Chevron's investment or a shift in the underlying net asset base of Tengizchevroil, while Chevron's ongoing financial commitment to the Tengiz and Korolev fields in Kazakhstan remained strong.",

At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\n\nPetroboscan Chevron  has  a  39.2  percent  interest  in  Petroboscan,  a  joint  stock  company  which  operates  the  Boscan  Field  in Venezuela.  In  2020,  the  company  fully  impaired  its  investments  in  the  Petroboscan  affiliate  and,  effective  July  1,  2020,  began accounting  for  this  venture  as  a  non-equity  method  investment.  The  company  also  has  an  outstanding  long-term  loan  to Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola  LNG Limited Chevron  has  a  36.4  percent  interest  in Angola  LNG  Limited,  which  processes  and  liquefies  natural  gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.

At December 31, 2024, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $73 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from  Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP) with a principal balance of $4,500.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG  Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. Included in the investment balance is a loan with a principal balance of $669 to fund a portion of the G olden Triangle Polymers Project in Orange, Texas, in which Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC owns 51 percent.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, produces and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.\n\nOther Information 'Sales and other operating revenues' on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $13,850, $13,623 and $16,286 with affiliated companies for 2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  'Purchased  crude  oil  and  products'  includes  $6,547, $7,404  and  $10,171  with  affiliated  companies  for  2024,  2023  and  2022, respectively.\n\n'Accounts and notes receivable' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $1,258 and $1,480 due from affiliated companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 'Accounts payable' includes $556 and $591 due to affiliated companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe  following  table  provides  summarized  financial  information  on  a 100  percent  basis  for  all  equity  affiliates  as  well  as  Chevron's  total  share,  which  includes Chevron's net loans to affiliates of $4,731, $4,494 and $4,278 at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' increased ownership stake in APLNG from 2022 to 2023 impact its exposure to coal bed methane (CBM) production volumes and investment valuation in the joint venture?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% interest in APLNG, increasing its stake and resulting in a fair value write-down to $5,574 million due to a decline in market valuation. APLNG, which produces CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, remained a key vehicle for ConocoPhillips' CBM exposure. By 2023, ConocoPhillips held a 47.5% ownership stake in APLNG, directly linking its production profile to APLNG's CBM output. This evolution in ownership from 2022 to 2023 increased both its strategic alignment with and financial exposure to CBM production volumes through APLNG.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron faced significant legal exposure in Louisiana through 39 lawsuits alleging environmental damage from historical oil operations, with a trial scheduled for October 2024, creating uncertainty around its operations in the state. Despite this, Chevron continued its renewable fuels expansion in Louisiana, advancing the Geismar renewable diesel plant's capacity from 7,000 to 22,000 barrels per day, with full operations expected in 2024. In 2024, Chevron, through its 50% stake in Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC, took Final Investment Decision (FID) to build a new oilseed processing plant in Louisiana, signaling a strategic pivot toward renewable feedstock production even amid ongoing litigation risks. This suggests that Chevron's legal challenges in Louisiana did not deter, and may have even accelerated, its transition toward renewable fuels through its joint ventures.",

      "question": "How did the change in COP's carrying value of its APLNG investment between 2023 and 2024 reflect the evolving financial obligations under APLNG's project finance facility, and what does this imply about COP's valuation assumptions given Origin Energy's continued operational role?",
      "answer": "In 2023, COP's carrying value of its APLNG investment was written down to $5,574 million due to the fair value assessment tied to the preemption right purchase of an additional 10% stake. By 2024, the carrying value had increased to approximately $5.0 billion, despite a reduction in the outstanding project finance facility from $4.7 billion to $4.0 billion. This suggests that COP's valuation assumptions evolved in response to improved expectations for APLNG's cash flows or reduced risk profile, even though Origin Energy's role as operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system remained unchanged, maintaining a consistent operational framework across both years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 APLNG: COP wrote down its investment in APLNG to $5,574 million due to fair value considerations during the 2023 fiscal year.",
        "Hop 2: APLNG \u2192 Origin Energy: Origin Energy operates APLNG's production and pipeline system, indicating a strategic and operational dependency.",
        "Hop 3: Origin Energy \u2190 COP(2024): By 2024, COP's carrying value of APLNG increased to $5.0 billion, with APLNG's outstanding debt decreasing to $4.0 billion, suggesting improved valuation outlook despite lower debt."

          "chunk_text": "## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

In 2024, PALNG de-designated a portion of these swaps, causing a shift in accounting treatment where the associated $35 million in changes in fair value was now recognized directly in 'Equity in earnings of affiliates' instead of other comprehensive income.

This transportation dependency aligns with Chevron's upstream developments in Kazakhstan, including the completion of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and the startup of the Future Growth Project (FGP) at Tengiz in 2024, which added 260,000 barrels per day of crude oil production capacity.

At December 31, 2024, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $73 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from  Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets.

      "answer": "In 2022, COP reported a 54% stake in ConocoPhillips, which had an impaired investment in APLNG valued at $5,574 million after a $688 million noncash impairment in Q4 2021. This impairment was triggered by a decline in APLNG's fair value below carrying value when ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% stake. By 2023, COP's 10-K confirmed that the carrying value of the APLNG investment had been permanently adjusted to $5,574 million, reflecting the 2021 impairment. The change indicates that COP's relationship with APLNG through ConocoPhillips evolved from a position of strategic expansion (via the preemptive stake increase) to a revalued, more conservative asset position by the end of 2023.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

      "question": "How did Chevron's (CVX) tax audit status in Kazakhstan in 2022 relate to its equity investment performance in Tengizchevroil by 2024, given the changes in both its unrecognized tax benefits and upstream earnings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron had not completed tax audits in Kazakhstan, with the last finalized audit dating back to 2012, contributing to $5,288 million in unrecognized tax benefits, some of which related to tax carryforwards requiring valuation allowances. By 2024, Chevron maintained a significant upstream equity investment in Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, with a carrying value of $27,368 million and equity earnings of $3,033 million for the year. This indicates that despite ongoing tax uncertainties in the jurisdiction, Chevron's upstream operations through Tengizchevroil remained a growing contributor to earnings, suggesting a strategic continuation or expansion of operations amid unresolved tax matters.",

        "Hop 1: CVX(2022) \u2192 Kazakhstan: Chevron had unresolved tax audits in Kazakhstan as of 2022, with the last finalized audit in 2012 and $5,288 million in unrecognized tax benefits.",
        "Hop 2: Kazakhstan \u2192 Tengizchevroil: Chevron's upstream earnings in Kazakhstan were largely attributable to its equity investment in Tengizchevroil in 2021, indicating a strong operational link.",
        "Hop 3: Tengizchevroil \u2190 CVX(2024): By 2024, Chevron reported a $27,368 million investment in Tengizchevroil with $3,033 million in annual equity earnings, showing continued operational significance."

          "chunk_text": "\nApproximately 82 percent of the $5,288 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.\n\nTax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company's major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2021. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States - 2013, Nigeria - 2007, Australia - 2009, Kazakhstan - 2012 and Saudi Arabia - 2015.\n\nThe  company  engages  in  ongoing  discussions  with  tax  authorities  regarding  the  resolution  of  tax  matters  in  the  various jurisdictions.  Both  the  outcome  of  these  tax  matters  and  the  timing  of  resolution  and/or  closure  of  the  tax  audits  are  highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company's total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still  remain  subject  to  examination  and  the  number  of  matters  being  examined  in  the  various  tax  jurisdictions,  the  company  is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips implemented the use of condensate for bitumen blending at Surmont's central processing facility 1, which enabled the company to lower blend ratios and diluent supply costs, gaining protection from synthetic crude oil supply disruptions. By 2024, ConocoPhillips had a 52.2% ownership stake in Alba Plant LLC, which processed natural gas from the Alba Unit and sold condensate at market prices\u2014directly linking condensate production to revenue. However, ConocoPhillips also had a contingent liability of up to $116 million tied to Alba Plant LLC\u2019s obligations to process third-party gas, showing how earlier cost-saving strategies with condensate were now financially entangled with downstream processing risks. This demonstrates a 3-hop chain: COP(2022) \u2192 Condensate \u2192 Alba Plant LLC \u2190 COP(2024).",

Operations include two central processing facilities for treatment and blending of bitumen.  At December 31, 2021, we held approximately 600,000 net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta.\n\nThe Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta.  Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total Energies SE that offers long-lived, sustained production.  We are focused on structurally lowering costs,  reducing GHG intensity and optimizing asset performance.\n\nIn 2021, we began processing a portion of Surmont's blended bitumen at the Diluent Recovery Unit constructed in Alberta, unlocking additional value for the asset by providing market access to our heavy crude oil.\n\nIn 2019, Surmont implemented the use of condensate for bitumen blending through the central processing facility 2; enabling the asset to lower blend ratio  and diluent supply costs, gain protection from synthetic crude oil supply disruptions and gain optionality on sales products.  The alternative blend project was complete in October at central processing facility 1.  Full Surmont Heavy Dilbit (condensate bitumen blend) was produced across both facilities in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n## Montney\n\nThe Montney is an unconventional resource play located in northeastern British Columbia.  At December 31, 2021, we held approximately 300,000 acres of land with 100 percent working interest in the liquids-rich section of the Montney.\n\nIn 2021, development activity consisted of drilling three horizontal wells and bringing 12 wells online.  In addition, construction on the second phase of our processing facility started.\n\n## Exploration\n\nOur primary exploration focus is assessing our Montney acreage.  In 2022, appraisal drilling and completions activity within the Montney will continue to explore the area's resource potential.  Additionally, we have exploration acreage in the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands.",

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% stake in APLNG, which resulted in a write-down of its investment to a fair value of $5,574 million, causing a before-tax charge of $688 million. APLNG, a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Australia, directly supports ConocoPhillips' access to CBM resources. By 2024, the carrying value of ConocoPhillips' equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion, indicating a continued strategic emphasis on CBM production despite the earlier write-down. This shows that while the company absorbed a financial loss in 2023, it maintained and leveraged its stake in APLNG to sustain its CBM production capabilities and LNG export position in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% shareholding in APLNG from Origin Energy, increasing its stake and signaling a strategic commitment to the joint venture. This decision was accompanied by an impairment of $688 million in Q4 2021 due to a decline in APLNG's fair value, which reflected the evolving risk profile of the investment. By 2024, ConocoPhillips had a 47.5% ownership stake in APLNG and was exposed to multiple financial guarantees totaling over $1.3 billion, including $210 million related to a project finance reserve account, $610 million tied to natural gas delivery obligations, and $480 million for performance guarantees on development contracts. The increased stake from 2022 led to a proportionally higher financial exposure by 2024, with ConocoPhillips assuming greater liability for APLNG's obligations over time.",

          "chunk_text": "- Disciplined investments. Our goal is to achieve strong  free cash flow by exercising capital  discipline, controlling our costs, and safely  and reliably delivering production.  We expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the price cycles.  Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return  to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest  back into the business for future cash flow expansion  .\n- o Exercise capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow.  As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities.  We allocate capital  across a geographically diverse,  low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline.  Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis.  Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and G&amp;A.  In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake.  Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders.\n- o Control our costs. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority.  Using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly  in a low commodity price environment.  The ability to control our operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.\n- o Optimize our portfolio. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho and Shell's Permian assets, significantly increasing our unconventional portfolio with many additional years of low cost of supply inventory.  The addition of this highly complementary acreage in the Midland and Delaware basins created a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48.  In our Asia Pacific segment, we notified Origin Energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG and announced the sale of our interests in Indonesia. See Note 3 .\n\nWe continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that don't compete.  As such, in conjunction with our Shell Permian acquisition announcement, we communicated an increase in our planned disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023 as part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts.\n\n- o Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:\n- \u25fe Acquire interest in existing  or new fields.\n- \u25fe Apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.\n- \u25fe Successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.\n\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.  This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "answer": "Chevron's crude oil reserves in Kazakhstan increased from 2,257 million barrels in 2022 to 2,490 million barrels in 2023, driven by extensions and discoveries and purchases.

Chevron transports most of this crude oil through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which it has a 15% interest. By 2024, Chevron had increased its investment in CPC to support the anticipated production growth, including a $4,500 million loan to TCO (operator of Tengiz and Korolev fields) to fund FGP and WPMP.

At December 31, 2024, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $73 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from  Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP) with a principal balance of $4,500.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG  Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. Included in the investment balance is a loan with a principal balance of $669 to fund a portion of the G olden Triangle Polymers Project in Orange, Texas, in which Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC owns 51 percent.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea.

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' financial guarantees related to APLNG in 2024 change compared to their equity investment and operational focus in Queensland, Australia in 2023, and what does this indicate about their risk exposure in the APLNG joint venture?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips held a 47.5% equity stake in APLNG, which operated in Queensland, Australia, producing coal bed methane (CBM) and exporting LNG, with a reported $4.7 billion in outstanding project finance facilities. By 2024, ConocoPhillips had multiple financial guarantees tied to APLNG, including a $210 million guarantee related to a project finance reserve account withdrawal, a $610 million (up to $1.0 billion in case of intentional breach) guarantee for natural gas delivery commitments, and an additional $480 million in performance guarantees, with carrying values of $14 million, $34 million, and $14 million respectively. This indicates an increase in direct financial risk exposure to APLNG\u2019s operational and contractual obligations, despite the company\u2019s long-standing equity investment. The evolution from a primarily equity-based investment in 2023 to a more liability-driven position in 2024 suggests a deepening of COP's commitment and risk tied to APLNG's performance.",

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips (COP) listed coalbed methane (CBM) as a key raw material it depends on. By 2024, this dependency was directly tied to its 47.5% ownership stake in APLNG, a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Australia for LNG processing and export. This strategic alignment with CBM feedstock was accompanied by significant financial guarantees from COP to support APLNG, including a $210 million guarantee with a six-year term and a $610 million (or up to $1.0 billion in case of reckless breach) guarantee tied to APLNG's gas delivery obligations under long-term sales agreements. These guarantees, totaling over $1.8 billion in potential exposure, reflect COP's deepening commitment to CBM as a core upstream resource and APLNG as a critical downstream asset in its LNG portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How did Chevron's (CVX) exploration and production activities in Nigeria evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in light of the regulatory framework governing deepwater offshore production sharing contracts and the company's continued operations in the region?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron disclosed its exploration and production activities in Nigeria, where deepwater offshore operations are governed by 30-year production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), including a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period that may be extended under the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted in 2021. Chevron had significant reserves in Africa, including 106 million barrels in Nigeria as of December 31, 2021. By 2024, Chevron continued to operate in Nigeria, maintaining its upstream focus in a region where crude oil prices and regulatory environments, including evolving climate-related policies, significantly influence earnings and operational strategy. The persistence of Chevron\u2019s operations in Nigeria indicates continuity in leveraging these PSCs, despite potential regulatory and market challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

Throughout the document, certain totals and percentages may not sum to their component parts due to rounding.\n\n## Business Environment and Outlook\n\nChevron Corporation is a global energy company with direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates that conduct substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia,  Bangladesh,  Brazil,  Canada,  China,  Egypt,  Equatorial  G uinea,  Israel,  Kazakhstan,  Mex ico,  Nigeria,  the  Partitioned  Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Venezuela.\n\nThe company's objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company's control. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the  company  to  adjust  operating  ex penses,  including  employee  reductions,  and  capital  ex penditures,  along  with  other  measures  intended  to  improve  financial performance.\n\nSome governments, companies, communities and other stakeholders are supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG  emissions are in various stages of design, adoption and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements; the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG  standards or disclosures and evolving standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising relating to emissions and emission reductions and removals.\n\nSome of these policies and programs include renewable and low carbon fuel standards, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S. and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard; programs that price GHG emissions, including",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil reported 490 gross thousands of undeveloped acres in South America, which included Guyana\u2014a region that saw significant exploration success in 2023 with four new discoveries on the Stabroek Block. This acreage provided the foundation for major production growth, as evidenced by the 390 thousand barrels of oil per day (kbd) produced from Guyana in 2023, with expectations for continued expansion. In 2023, ExxonMobil projected that the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas would generally increase over the next several years, driven by developments in Guyana and the Permian Basin, where production averaged 610 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2023, up from the prior year. The undeveloped acreage from 2022 thus directly enabled the production growth trajectory outlined in 2023, particularly in the Americas region.",

      "question": "How did ExxonMobil's reliance on oil in 2022 align with its strategic positioning in response to the projected global energy mix through 2050 as outlined in the 2023 filing?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil relied heavily on oil, converting natural gas to an oil-equivalent basis at a rate of six billion cubic feet per one million barrels, underscoring its deep integration with hydrocarbon resources. The 2023 filing projected that oil would remain the largest energy source, maintaining close to a 30% share in the global energy mix through 2050. In response, ExxonMobil positioned itself to support decarbonization through technologies like lower-emission fuels, hydrogen-based fuels, and carbon capture and storage, aiming to maintain relevance in a transitioning energy landscape while capitalizing on the continued demand for oil. This shows a strategic alignment between ExxonMobil\u2019s core resource (oil) and its forward-looking investments in transitional technologies to adapt to the evolving energy mix.",

      "question": "How did Chevron's (CVX) investment in Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC in 2023 influence its soybean oil feedstock strategy in 2024, particularly in light of the new oilseed processing plant FID decision?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron maintained a 50% working interest in Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC, which produced soybean oil at facilities in Destrehan, Louisiana, and Cairo, Illinois. This soybean oil served as a renewable feedstock for fuels like renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. By 2024, Chevron's continued ownership of this joint venture was complemented by a final investment decision (FID) to build a new oilseed processing plant in Louisiana, signaling a strategic expansion of its soybean oil sourcing capacity. This evolution suggests that Chevron's earlier stake in the joint venture laid the groundwork for deeper vertical integration into soybean oil production, aligning with its broader renewable fuels production goals, such as the Geismar plant's capacity increase to 22,000 barrels per day expected in 2025.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips held a 30% stake in QatarEnergy LNG N3, which produced approximately 1.4 gross BCF per day of natural gas and 7.8 million gross tonnes per year of LNG. N3 was jointly developed with QatarEnergy LNG N4, a Shell-QatarEnergy JV, under an integrated model that included shared offshore facilities and two identical LNG process trains. By 2024, this structure remained consistent, with COP still holding 30% in N3, and the mutualization of production between N3 and N4 continued under the same integrated development framework. This suggests that the collaboration model and facility sharing between COP's N3 and Shell's N4 remained stable year-over-year, supporting efficient utilization of shared infrastructure in the North Field.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "question": "How did Chevron's (CVX) investment in Kazakhstan in 2023 compare to its 2022 reserves tied to TCO, and what does this reveal about the company's upstream strategy in the region?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron's reserves tied to TCO stood at 1,701 million BOE, reflecting production and reserve changes over prior years. By 2023, Chevron invested approximately $2.5 billion in Asia, primarily for TCO's development projects in Kazakhstan, and held 511 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves related to TCO. This indicates a strategic focus on long-term upstream development in Kazakhstan, with significant capital allocation to advance major projects like FGP and WPMP, despite some reductions in total reserves over the year.",

        "Hop 1: CVX(2022) \u2192 TCO: Chevron's 2022 reserves tied to TCO were 1,701 million BOE, showing production and reserve changes from prior years.",
        "Hop 2: TCO \u2192 Kazakhstan: TCO operates in Kazakhstan, focusing on major projects like FGP and WPMP at Tengiz and Korolev fields under concession agreements.",
        "Hop 3: Kazakhstan \u2190 CVX(2023): Chevron invested $2.5 billion in Asia in 2023, primarily for TCO's development in Kazakhstan, and held 511 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves linked to TCO."

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron's ability to meet its climate-related targets was described as highly uncertain, with the company noting that its success would depend on factors like the availability and cost of carbon credits, regulatory developments, and market conditions. By 2024, Chevron had acquired Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG), reflected in the $352 million goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the downstream segment. This acquisition marked a strategic shift, as REG became central to Chevron's renewable fuels offering and carbon credit generation activities. This move aligns with Chevron's $10 billion planned capital spend through 2028 for lower carbon investments, signaling a transition from reliance on external carbon credit markets to internal generation through strategic acquisitions and integrated operations.",

Requirements  for  these  and  other  similar  policies  and  programs  are  complex ,  ever  changing,  program  specific  and  encompass:  (1)  the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels; (2) the purchasing, selling, utilizing and retiring of allowances and carbon credits; and (3) other emissions reduction measures including efficiency improvements and capturing GHG  emissions. These compliance policies and programs have had and may continue to have negative impacts on the company now and in the future including, but not limited to, the displacement of hydrocarbon and other products and/or the impairment of assets. These policies have also enabled opportunities for Chevron in its lower carbon business lines. For example, Renewable Energy G roup, Inc. (REG ) produces most of  Chevron's renewable fuels offering and generates a substantial amount of the company's carbon credit generation activities. Although we expect the company's costs to comply with these policies and programs to continue to increase, these costs currently do not have a material impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations.\n\nSignificant uncertainty remains as to the pace and extent to which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is  difficult  to  predict  with  certainty  and is ex pected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company's activities and market conditions. As discussed below, in 2021, the company announced planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come.\n\nChevron supports the Paris Agreement's global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of  its  operations  while  continuing  to  meet  the  demand  for  energy.  Chevron  believes  that  broad,  market-based  mechanisms  are  the  most  efficient  approach  to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company's longrange supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards and demand response to oil and natural gas prices.\n\nThe company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' and consumers' demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow new businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen, power generation for data centers, and emerging technologies. To grow its new businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company's capabilities, assets, partnerships and customer relationships.  The company's oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon market, economic, legislative and regulatory forces, among other factors.\n\nIn  2021,  Chevron  announced  aspirations  and  targets  that  align  with  its  strategy,  as  noted  below .  Chevron  uses  emissions  intensity  targets,  which  enable  the company to assess, quantify and transparently communicate its own carbon performance in a standardized way. Chevron regularly evaluates its aspirations, targets and goals and expects to change or eliminate some of its aspirations, targets and goals for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors.\n\nThe company's ability to achieve any aspiration, target or goal is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron's control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies  and  low-  or  non-carbon-based  energy  sources;  (2)  laws,  governmental  regulation,  policies,  and  other  enabling  actions,  including  those  regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our",

The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2024, and no impairment was required.\n\n## Note 28\n\n## Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n\nChevron's expected credit loss allowance balance was $611 and $641 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances.\n\nThe majority of the company's receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $18,338 at December 31, 2024, which reflects the company's diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company's broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk  is  lim ited.  The  company  routinely  assesses  the  financial  strength  of  its  customers.  When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is ex tended and a receivable balance exists,  the  company applies a quantitative  calculation  to  current  trade  receivable  balances  that  reflects  credit  risk  predictive  analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company's historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company's expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days.\n\nChevron's non-trade receivable balance was $3,835 at December 31, 2024, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review.  This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts.  Non-trade  receivables  also  include  employee  and  tax   receivables  that  are  deemed  immaterial  and  low  risk.  Loans  to  equity  affiliates  and  non-equity investees are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of zero and $219 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included within 'Investments and advances' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips recorded a $688 million impairment on its APLNG investment due to a decline in fair value below carrying value, triggered by Origin Energy\u2019s decision to sell a 10% stake in APLNG, which ConocoPhillips preempted to acquire. This indicated a market reassessment of APLNG\u2019s value. APLNG, operated by Origin Energy, had a $5.7 billion outstanding balance on its $8.5 billion project finance facility as of 2021, which was refinanced over time and remained non-recourse. By 2024, the carrying value of ConocoPhillips\u2019 equity method investment in APLNG had recovered to $5.0 billion, despite the earlier impairment, suggesting stabilization in APLNG\u2019s financial position and continued strategic alignment with Origin Energy as operator.

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips impaired its APLNG investment by $688 million, reducing the carrying value to $5,574 million due to a decline in fair value below book value. This impairment was tied to APLNG\u2019s operations in Queensland, Australia, which were central to its coal bed methane (CBM) production and LNG export activities. By 2024, the carrying value of the APLNG investment had decreased further to approximately $5.0 billion, indicating continued financial pressure on the joint venture. APLNG's debt structure also evolved, with the outstanding balance on its project financing decreasing from $5.7 billion in 2021 to $4.0 billion by the end of 2024, reflecting ongoing bi-annual repayments. The temporal analysis shows that the initial impairment was a response to market valuation concerns, and the subsequent carrying value in 2024 reflects a continued, albeit reduced, investment position in Queensland\u2019s LNG operations.",

ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  As such, our investment in APLNG was written down to its fair value of $5,574 million, resulting in a before-tax charge of $688 million. See Note 4 and Note 7 .",

          "chunk_text": "\nOur share of income taxes incurred directly by an equity method investee is reported in equity in earnings of affiliates, and as such is not included in income taxes on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, retained earnings included $ 42 million related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies.  Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

      "question": "Chevron's 2022 filing described exploration terms in Angola, including negotiated extensions for production periods. How did the company's $700 million investment in 2023 across Africa, specifically in Angola LNG, reflect a strategic shift from exploration to development, and what does this suggest about their timeline for converting proved undeveloped reserves into production?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron's exploration and production activities in Angola were governed by production sharing agreements with initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years, with negotiated extensions for production periods lasting 20 to 30 years. This regulatory framework provided Chevron with long-term flexibility to develop discoveries. By 2023, the company had strategically shifted focus toward development, as evidenced by its $700 million investment in Africa, which included activity in Angola. Specifically, Chevron reported that Angola LNG accounted for 64 million BOE in proved undeveloped reserves that had remained undeveloped for five years or more. The investment indicates a deliberate move to convert these long-standing proved undeveloped reserves into production, suggesting an operational timeline aligned with facility upgrades and reservoir optimization. This evolution reflects a transition from exploration risk to execution focus, leveraging the extended production terms outlined in 2022 to advance long-term development plans.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Exxon Mobil had an indirect 69.6% interest in Imperial Oil Limited, which held a 25% stake in Syncrude, resulting in an effective ownership of approximately 17.4% of Syncrude. In 2024, despite no change in the ownership structure, Exxon Mobil continued to report the same 62 thousand barrels per day of synthetic crude oil production from Syncrude, indicating stable production levels despite potential operational or market changes over the two-year period.",

Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation. During 2024, average net production at Kearl was about 262 thousand barrels per day.\n\n## 5. Present Activities\n\n## A. Wells Drilling\n\n",

      "question": "How did Chevron's strategic focus on soybean oil production through Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC in Louisiana evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what new developments were announced in 2024 that reflect this trajectory?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron held a 50% working interest in Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC, which produced soybean oil at facilities in Destrehan, Louisiana, and Cairo, Illinois, positioning the joint venture as a key supplier of renewable feedstock for fuels like renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. This operation was part of Chevron's broader renewable fuels strategy, which included expansion at the Geismar renewable diesel plant in Louisiana, increasing capacity from 7,000 to 22,000 barrels per day, with full operations expected in 2024. By 2024, Chevron continued its focus on Louisiana operations, with final commissioning underway at Geismar for the expanded plant, and a new development was announced: a final investment decision (FID) was taken to build a new oilseed processing plant in Louisiana, signaling a deepening commitment to soybean oil as a core renewable feedstock in the region.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron (CVX) relied heavily on crude oil production through TCO, which was developing the Tengiz and Korolev fields in Kazakhstan. TCO achieved mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP) in 2023, with startup expected in the first half of 2025. This development was expected to significantly increase production capacity. By 2024, CVX\u2019s consolidated crude oil reserves associated with TCO had decreased slightly from 78 million barrels in 2023 to 72 million barrels in 2024, suggesting that production or sales outpaced additions during this period. This indicates that while FGP was progressing, its impact on reserves had not yet materialized, and CVX was likely managing production drawdowns in anticipation of future capacity expansion.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Exxon (XOM) projected that oil would remain the largest energy source globally, maintaining a ~30% share through 2050, reinforcing its strategic emphasis on hydrocarbons within a diverse energy mix. This outlook directly informed XOM's 2024 operations, where oil remained a core dependency, evidenced by its continued use of the oil-equivalent conversion metric (6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per one million barrels of oil). This metric reflects the company's integration of natural gas into its oil-centric framework, aligning with its long-term view of oil's sustained relevance despite growing renewable energy adoption.",

APLNG, operating in Queensland, Australia, had $4.7 billion in outstanding project finance obligations as of December 31, 2023, stemming from its $8.5 billion facility executed in 2012. By 2024, APLNG's outstanding balance had decreased to $4.0 billion, indicating progress in debt repayment. COP's carrying value of its equity investment in APLNG increased slightly to $5.0 billion by December 31, 2024, suggesting stabilization or improved outlook for APLNG's operations in Queensland despite earlier impairments.

          "chunk_text": "## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% interest in APLNG, which led to a $688 million before-tax charge due to the fair value of the investment being below its carrying value. This signaled a strategic commitment to maintaining a strong position in the joint venture despite short-term financial impacts. By 2023, the ownership structure of APLNG was explicitly stated as ConocoPhillips holding 47.5%, with Origin Energy at 27.5%, indicating a continued but recalibrated partnership. The evolution from a reactive investment adjustment in 2022 to a clearly defined equity stake in 2023 shows a strategic shift from mitigating risk to solidifying long-term collaboration with Origin Energy in Australian CBM and LNG operations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% stake in APLNG, which was directly tied to Origin Energy\u2019s decision to sell its 10% interest for $1.645 billion. This triggered a reassessment of APLNG\u2019s fair value, which was found to be below the carrying value of ConocoPhillips\u2019 existing investment. As a result, in Q4 2022, ConocoPhillips recorded a $688 million noncash impairment charge, reducing the carrying value of its APLNG investment to $5,574 million. In 2023, this impairment was reflected in the financial statements, with the updated carrying value aligning to the fair value determined through the preemption transaction. The company also reported the updated stake in APLNG under its equity method investments, showing how the 2022 strategic move directly impacted the financial valuation and reporting in the following year.",

          "chunk_text": "- Disciplined investments. Our goal is to achieve strong  free cash flow by exercising capital  discipline, controlling our costs, and safely  and reliably delivering production.  We expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the price cycles.  Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return  to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest  back into the business for future cash flow expansion  .\n- o Exercise capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow.  As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities.  We allocate capital  across a geographically diverse,  low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline.  Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis.  Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and G&amp;A.  In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake.  Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders.\n- o Control our costs. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority.  Using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly  in a low commodity price environment.  The ability to control our operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.\n- o Optimize our portfolio. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho and Shell's Permian assets, significantly increasing our unconventional portfolio with many additional years of low cost of supply inventory.  The addition of this highly complementary acreage in the Midland and Delaware basins created a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48.  In our Asia Pacific segment, we notified Origin Energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG and announced the sale of our interests in Indonesia. See Note 3 .\n\nWe continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that don't compete.  As such, in conjunction with our Shell Permian acquisition announcement, we communicated an increase in our planned disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023 as part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts.\n\n- o Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:\n- \u25fe Acquire interest in existing  or new fields.\n- \u25fe Apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.\n- \u25fe Successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.\n\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.  This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' financial exposure through its guarantees to APLNG in 2024 compare to its 2023 position, and what does this indicate about its evolving risk profile tied to CBM production in Queensland, Australia?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips had a 47.5% ownership stake in APLNG, which was actively producing coalbed methane (CBM) from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. By 2024, ConocoPhillips had several guarantees tied to APLNG, including a $210 million guarantee with a carrying value of $14 million, a $610 million (up to $1.0 billion in case of intentional or reckless breach) liability tied to gas delivery commitments, and an additional $480 million in performance guarantees. This indicates a significant increase in financial exposure and risk tied to CBM production through APLNG, reflecting a deepened strategic commitment to the venture despite heightened liability.",

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How did Chevron's (CVX) investment in Nigeria in 2023 reflect changes in the company's reliance on production-sharing contracts (PSCs) as outlined in its 2022 disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron disclosed that 8% of its consolidated reserve quantities were related to production-sharing contracts (PSCs), which are governed by specific regulatory frameworks in host countries like Nigeria. In Nigeria, PSCs typically have a 30-year term, including a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period, with partial relinquishment requirements. By 2023, Chevron invested approximately $0.7 billion in offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, indicating a continued strategic focus on regions governed by PSCs. This investment aligns with the company's ongoing reliance on PSCs to access reserves, despite the regulatory complexities and partial relinquishment obligations tied to these contracts.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips recorded a $688 million noncash impairment charge to write down its APLNG investment to a fair value of $5,574 million, reflecting a market participant view that APLNG\u2019s value had declined below its carrying value. This impairment was tied to Origin Energy\u2019s decision to sell a 10% stake in APLNG for $1.645 billion, which triggered ConocoPhillips\u2019 preemption right and signaled a reassessment of APLNG\u2019s fair value. By 2023, the carrying value of the investment remained at $5,574 million, indicating that the market valuation had stabilized post-impairment. This evolution in valuation methodology and the strategic decision to exercise the preemption right show that ConocoPhillips sought to maintain or strengthen its position in Queensland\u2019s LNG market despite short-term valuation pressures.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

      "question": "How did the change in the percentage of proved reserves reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton from 2023 to 2024 reflect a shift in ConocoPhillips' reliance on third-party validation of reserves estimation processes, and what might this indicate about the evolution of their internal controls?",
      "answer": "In 2023, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) reviewed processes and controls used to assess over 90% of ConocoPhillips' proved reserves, while in 2024, this percentage dropped to over 85%. This decrease suggests a potential shift in ConocoPhillips' reliance on third-party validation of reserves estimation processes, possibly indicating increased confidence in internal controls or a strategic decision to reduce external oversight. The continued involvement of D&M as a senior representative within the internal review team and their inclusion as Exhibit 99 in the 2024 10-K filing shows that the firm remains a key component of the reserves reporting framework, but the reduced scope of their review could signal an evolution in how internal controls are being applied across business units.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 Reserves Processes: In 2023, D&M reviewed over 90% of proved reserves to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of internal processes and controls in accordance with SEC regulations.",
        "Hop 2: Reserves Processes \u2192 DeGolyer and MacNaughton: D&M's role is to provide independent third-party input on reserves estimation processes, ensuring consistency and compliance with SEC definitions and company policy.",

          "chunk_text": "We have a company-wide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business unit's reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.\n\nDuring 2024, our processes and controls used to assess over 85 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2024, were reviewed by D&amp;M. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2024 proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master's degree in reservoir engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 20 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n138",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron's acquisition of Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG) significantly expanded its renewable fuels production capacity and carbon credit generation activities, aligning with its broader lower carbon strategy. By 2024, REG was producing most of Chevron\u2019s renewable fuels and generating a substantial portion of its carbon credits. This shift was supported by Chevron\u2019s $10 billion planned capital spend through 2028 on lower carbon investments, announced in 2021, which emphasized growth in carbon credit generation and other lower carbon business lines. Chevron's 2024 disclosures also highlighted increased dependency on the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits \u2014 a direct outcome of the strategic pivot initiated in 2023 through the REG acquisition.",

Requirements  for  these  and  other  similar  policies  and  programs  are  complex ,  ever  changing,  program  specific  and  encompass:  (1)  the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels; (2) the purchasing, selling, utilizing and retiring of allowances and carbon credits; and (3) other emissions reduction measures including efficiency improvements and capturing GHG  emissions. These compliance policies and programs have had and may continue to have negative impacts on the company now and in the future including, but not limited to, the displacement of hydrocarbon and other products and/or the impairment of assets. These policies have also enabled opportunities for Chevron in its lower carbon business lines. For example, Renewable Energy G roup, Inc. (REG ) produces most of  Chevron's renewable fuels offering and generates a substantial amount of the company's carbon credit generation activities. Although we expect the company's costs to comply with these policies and programs to continue to increase, these costs currently do not have a material impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations.\n\nSignificant uncertainty remains as to the pace and extent to which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is  difficult  to  predict  with  certainty  and is ex pected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company's activities and market conditions. As discussed below, in 2021, the company announced planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come.\n\nChevron supports the Paris Agreement's global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of  its  operations  while  continuing  to  meet  the  demand  for  energy.  Chevron  believes  that  broad,  market-based  mechanisms  are  the  most  efficient  approach  to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company's longrange supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards and demand response to oil and natural gas prices.\n\nThe company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' and consumers' demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow new businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen, power generation for data centers, and emerging technologies. To grow its new businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company's capabilities, assets, partnerships and customer relationships.  The company's oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon market, economic, legislative and regulatory forces, among other factors.\n\nIn  2021,  Chevron  announced  aspirations  and  targets  that  align  with  its  strategy,  as  noted  below .  Chevron  uses  emissions  intensity  targets,  which  enable  the company to assess, quantify and transparently communicate its own carbon performance in a standardized way. Chevron regularly evaluates its aspirations, targets and goals and expects to change or eliminate some of its aspirations, targets and goals for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors.\n\nThe company's ability to achieve any aspiration, target or goal is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron's control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies  and  low-  or  non-carbon-based  energy  sources;  (2)  laws,  governmental  regulation,  policies,  and  other  enabling  actions,  including  those  regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our",

Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG  ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG  matters, including human rights, biodiversity, waste and water, have increased, and may continue to increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment.\n\nOur ambitions and disclosures related to ESG matters subject us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our reputation and stock price or result in other material adverse impacts to the company Chevron has set a number of lower carbon-related ambitions, which may include aspirations, targets, guidance, objectives, metrics, and/or goals. In particular, Chevron has announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in upstream by 2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for upstream carbon intensity and portfolio carbon intensity. Chevron regularly evaluates its ambitions and expects to change or eliminate some of these aspirations, targets, and other ambitions for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors.\n\nOur ability to achieve any ambition, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, including those outlined in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 35 through 37, and any new businesses, is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron's control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) laws, governmental regulation, policies, and other enabling actions, including  those  regarding  subsidies,  tax   and  other  incentives  as  well  as  the  granting  of  necessary  permits  by  governing  authorities;  (3)  the  availability  and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC's Global Warming Potentials and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program,  affecting  ESG   standards  or  disclosures;  (6)  evolving  standards  for  tracking  and  reporting  on  emissions  and  emission  reductions  and  removals;  (7) customers' and consumers' preferences and use of the company's products or substitute products; (8) actions taken by the company's competitors in response to legislation and regulations; and (9) successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions with customers, suppliers, partners, and governments.\n\nThe standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, disclosing, marketing and advertising related to ESG  matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Further, our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time. Either of these circumstances may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period.\n\nOur existing processes and controls may not align with evolving voluntary and mandatory standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG  metrics. Our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, including through non-public processes, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. For example, Chevron's methane intensity target is calculated based on Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2021), which requires use of local regulatory reporting methodologies where applicable. The U.S. EPA has adopted notable changes to reporting methodologies in its G reenhouse G as Reporting Program (40 C.F.R. Part 98.230), which are applicable to Chevron's U.S. operations. We expect these adopted changes may increase our reported emissions in future years, and therefore, increase  our  reported  methane  intensity.  In  addition,  Chevron  participates,  along  with  other  companies,  institutes,  universities,  trade  associations  and  other organizations, in various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects that express various ambitions, aspirations and goals related to climate change, emissions and energy transition. Chevron's individual ambitions, future performance or policies may differ from the ambitions of such organizations or the individual ambitions of other participants in these various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects, and Chevron may unilaterally change its individual ambitions. Achievement of or efforts to achieve ambitions such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives has, and may continue to, increase costs, and, in addition, may require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the company's business plans, operations and financial results, potentially resulting in reduction to the economic endof-life of certain assets, impairing the associated net book value, among other material adverse impacts.

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' increased ownership stake in APLNG from 2022 to 2023 impact its operational exposure to Queensland, Australia, and what does this shift indicate about its strategic positioning in the Australian LNG market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% interest in APLNG, increasing its stake and resulting in a write-down of the investment to $5,574 million due to fair value considerations. APLNG operates in Queensland, Australia, where it produces coal bed methane (CBM) and exports LNG, with operations split between production (operated by Origin Energy) and liquefaction (operated by ConocoPhillips). By 2023, ConocoPhillips' ownership in APLNG had formally increased to 47.5%, reflecting a strategic move to deepen its presence in the region. This growing stake correlates with a stronger operational footprint in Queensland, signaling a long-term commitment to the Australian LNG market. The evolution of this investment suggests a deliberate strategy to consolidate influence over APLNG\u2019s LNG export capabilities and enhance its position in the Asia-Pacific energy trade.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities.

The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

          "chunk_text": "At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' increased NGL production in 2023 influence its acquisition of additional Alaskan assets from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips reported 797 million barrels of Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) produced in the Lower 48, up from 749 million barrels in 2022, indicating a growing focus on NGL production. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a major producer of NGLs, operated assets in Alaska, including the Kuparuk River and Prudhoe Bay Units. In Q4 2024, ConocoPhillips completed an acquisition from Chevron U.S.A. Inc., increasing its working interest in these units for $296 million. The timing and nature of these transactions suggest that COP\u2019s increased NGL production in 2023 may have influenced its decision to acquire additional assets from Chevron, a key NGL producer, in 2024 to further consolidate its position in core NGL-rich basins.",

See Note 15 .\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, \"Total Revenues and Other Income\" and \"Net Income (Loss)\" associated with the acquired assets were $677 million and i ncome of $66 million, respectively.\n\n## Alaska Acquisition\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, after exercising our preferential rights, we completed an acquisition that increased our working interest by approximately 5 percent in the Kuparuk River Unit and approximately 0.4 percent in the Prudhoe Bay Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Union Oil Company of California for $296 million, before customary adjustments. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, with the consideration allocated primarily to PP&amp;E.\n\n## Assets Held For Sale\n\nIn December 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment for $235 million, before customary adjustments. These assets have a net carrying value of approximately $235 million, which consists primarily of $251 million of PP&amp;E and $16 million of l i a bi l i ti es , pri ma ri l y noncurrent AROs. These assets met held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter of 2024, and as of December 31, 2024, we reclassified the PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and the noncurrent liabilities to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet. This transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n## 87 ConocoPhillips   2024 10-K",

      "question": "How did Chevron's investment in Kazakhstan in 2023 relate to the development progress of TCO, and how did this affect Chevron's stake in TCO by the end of 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron invested approximately $2.5 billion in development projects in Asia, primarily for TCO in Kazakhstan. This investment supported major developments such as the mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP) and the ongoing Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) at TCO, which were expected to start-up in the first half of 2025. By the end of 2024, Chevron\u2019s stake in TCO decreased slightly from 78 million barrels of reserves at the end of 2023 to 72 million barrels at the end of 2024, reflecting production drawdowns and minor revisions in reserve estimates. This evolution shows how Chevron's earlier capital allocation to TCO's infrastructure influenced its downstream reserve position in the subsequent year.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips was actively producing condensate from fields like Aasta Hansteen, transporting it via shuttle tankers to market. In 2024, following the acquisition of Marathon Oil, COP significantly expanded its presence in Equatorial Guinea, including a 52.2% interest in Alba Plant LLC, which processes natural gas from the Alba Unit and monetizes condensate and LPG at market prices. This strategic shift is further evidenced by COP's $116 million in potential future payment obligations tied to Alba Plant LLC's third-party gas processing agreements, indicating a strong financial commitment to monetizing natural gas liquids in the region.",

With the acquisition, we have increased our global operations adding oil, natural gas and LNG activity in Equatorial Guinea to our portfolio. See Note 3.\n\nWe have varying stages of oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in Equatorial Guinea. We operate in both the Alba and Block D PSCs that form the Alba Unit located offshore Equatorial Guinea.\n\n## Gas Processing\n\nThe following facilities located on Bioko Island allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba Unit and are accounted for as equity method i nvestments and are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.\n\nWe own a 52.2 percent interest in the Alba Plant LLC, our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (27.8 percent) and Sociedad Nacional de Gas de Guinea Ecuatorial (SONAGAS) (20.0 percent), which operates an onshore liquified petroleum gas (LPG) processing plant. Alba Plant LLC processes Alba Unit natural gas under a fixed-rate long-term contract. The LPG processing plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and sells it at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement. Processed natural gas is delivered to Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (EG LNG) for liquefaction and storage. We market our share of LNG to third parties indexed at global LNG prices.\n\nWe own a 56.0 percent interest in EG LNG, our joint venture with SONAGAS (37.9 percent) and Marubeni Gas Development UK Limited (6.1 percent), which operates a 3.7 MTPA LNG production facility. In January 2024, we began a five-year LNG sales agreement for a portion of our equity gas from the Alba Unit, providing us with additional exposure to the European LNG market.\n\nWe own a 45.0 percent interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (AMPCO), our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (45.0 percent) and SONAGAS (10.0 percent), which operates a methanol plant.

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' 2023 write-down of its APLNG investment relate to the production of coal bed methane (CBM) in 2024, and what does this imply about the company's strategic positioning in Australian LNG markets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips wrote down its investment in APLNG to a fair value of $5,574 million due to the sale price reflecting a market participant view that was below the carrying value, resulting in a $688 million charge. APLNG, in which COP holds a 47.5% stake, produces CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, which is processed into LNG and exported primarily to Asia Pacific markets. By 2024, the carrying value of COP\u2019s equity investment in APLNG had stabilized at approximately $5.0 billion, suggesting a partial recovery or stabilization in valuation.

Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil's production-sharing contracts (PSCs) in Nigeria were subject to a 30-year term, including a 10-year exploration period with partial relinquishment required at its end, followed by a 20-year production period that could be extended under the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted in 2021. By 2024, these contracts influenced the company's proved reserves, with 11% of total proved reserves (on an oil-equivalent basis) associated with PSC arrangements. However, asset sales in Nigeria during 2024 reduced reserves by 0.1 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB), indicating that contract expirations or renegotiations may have led to divestitures or reductions in operational control. This shows a temporal evolution where the contractual framework in Nigeria shaped ExxonMobil's reserve base and asset portfolio over time.",

          "chunk_text": "ExxonMobil's investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks, and leases. The terms  and  conditions  under  which  the  Corporation  maintains  exploration  and/or  production  rights  to  the  acreage  are  propertyspecific, contractually defined, and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.\n\n## D. Summary of Acreage Terms\n\n## UNITED STATES\n\nOil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners. Leases typically have an exploration period ranging  from  one  to  ten  years,  and  a  production  period  that  normally  remains  in  effect  until  production  ceases.  Under  certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private property, a 'fee interest' is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.\n\n## CANADA / OTHER AMERICAS\n\n## Canada\n\nExploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a term  of  nine  years.  Offshore  production  licenses  are  valid  for  25  years,  with  rights  of  extension  for  continued  production. Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term.\n\n## Argentina\n\nThe  Federal  Hydrocarbon  Law  was  amended  in  2014.  Pursuant  to  the  amended  law,  the  production  term  for  an  onshore unconventional concession is 35 years, and 25 years for a conventional concession, with unlimited 10-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years, divided  into  two  exploration  periods  of  four  years,  with  an  optional  extension  of  five  years  for  each  license.  Two  onshore exploration  concessions  were  initially  granted  prior  to  the  amendment  and  are  governed  under  Provincial  Law  with  expiration terms through 2024.\n\n## Brazil\n\nThe exploration and production of oil and gas are governed by concession contracts and production sharing contracts. Concession contracts  provide  for  an  exploration  period  of  up  to  8  years  and  a  production  period  of  27  years.  Production  sharing  contracts provide for an exploration period of up to 7 years and a production period of up to 28 years.\n\n## Guyana\n\nThe  Petroleum  (Exploration  and  Production)  Act  authorizes  the  government  of  Guyana  to  grant  petroleum  prospecting  and production  licenses  and  to  enter  into  petroleum  agreements  for  the  exploration  and  production  of  hydrocarbons.  Petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years and a production period of 20 years, with a 10-year extension.\n\n## EUROPE\n\n## Germany\n\nExploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nUnder the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "question": "How did the change in DeGolyer and MacNaughton's role from an active reviewer in 2022 to an exhibit contributor in 2023 affect ConocoPhillips' reserves estimation process and its external validation mechanisms?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips had DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) actively review over 90% of its proved reserves estimation processes to ensure compliance with SEC regulations. D&M provided independent assessments through on-site visits, data reviews, and consultations, with their findings reported directly to senior management. By 2023, D&M's involvement was reduced to the inclusion of their consent and report as static exhibits in the 10-K filing, suggesting a shift from active third-party oversight to a more passive documentation role. This change indicates a reduction in the frequency and depth of external validation of reserves processes, potentially signaling increased internal confidence in their estimation methodology or a strategic shift in compliance strategy.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 Reserves Processes: ConocoPhillips disclosed that D&M actively reviewed over 90% of its proved reserves estimation processes in 2021, with the review conducted as part of internal controls and included detailed technical data and consultations.",
        "Hop 2: Reserves Processes \u2192 DeGolyer and MacNaughton: D&M was integrated into the internal review team and played a key role in validating reserves estimation methods and assumptions, ensuring consistency and SEC compliance.",

          "chunk_text": "## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar.

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron's TCO affiliate exported most of its crude oil through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which had a throughput of 1.4 million barrels per day.

By 2024, the WPMP was completed, and the FGP began production in early 2025, increasing crude oil production by 260,000 barrels per day at full capacity. This expansion was supported by the continued use of the CPC pipeline, which maintained an average throughput of 1.4 million barrels per day.

By the end of 2024, Chevron had provided a loan of $4,500 million to TCO to fund the development of both the WPMP and FGP, indicating a significant increase in capital commitment to the project. Additionally, Chevron\u2019s carrying value of its investment in TCO was $73 million higher than its underlying equity in TCO\u2019s net assets, reflecting the premium paid for certain portions of the TCO stake and the ongoing investment in growth projects.

At December 31, 2024, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $73 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from  Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP) with a principal balance of $4,500.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG  Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. Included in the investment balance is a loan with a principal balance of $669 to fund a portion of the G olden Triangle Polymers Project in Orange, Texas, in which Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC owns 51 percent.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, produces and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.\n\nOther Information 'Sales and other operating revenues' on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $13,850, $13,623 and $16,286 with affiliated companies for 2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  'Purchased  crude  oil  and  products'  includes  $6,547, $7,404  and  $10,171  with  affiliated  companies  for  2024,  2023  and  2022, respectively.\n\n'Accounts and notes receivable' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $1,258 and $1,480 due from affiliated companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

      "question": "How did ExxonMobil's long-standing operational exposure in Nigeria through production-sharing contracts influence their global acreage acquisition strategy in 2023, particularly in regions with comparable contract structures?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's operational history in Nigeria since at least 2006 under 30-year production-sharing contracts (PSCs) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation shaped their approach to global acreage acquisitions in 2023. In Nigeria, PSCs included a 10-year exploration period followed by a 20-year production period, with partial relinquishment required after the exploration phase. By 2023, ExxonMobil was seen applying similar risk-mitigation strategies in other regions with comparable contract structures\u2014such as Guyana, where exploration licenses allowed up to 10 years and production periods of 20\u201330 years with optional extensions, and Brazil, where PSCs provided exploration periods of up to 7 years and production periods of up to 28 years. This suggests a strategic alignment toward jurisdictions offering contract terms with flexibility and long-term production rights, mirroring their Nigerian experience.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "question": "What was the strategic impact of ConocoPhillips' increased investment in APLNG from 2022 to 2024 on its CBM production capabilities and LNG position in Australia?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' strategic position in Australian CBM production and LNG export was affected by both the impairment of its APLNG investment in 2022 and the subsequent evolution of its stake. In 2022, the company recorded a $688 million pre-tax impairment charge on its APLNG investment, reducing the carrying value to $5,574 million due to a decline in fair value. Despite this, COP exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% interest in APLNG, signaling continued strategic commitment to CBM resources and LNG infrastructure in Queensland. By 2024, the carrying value of COP\u2019s equity method investment in APLNG had increased to approximately $5.0 billion, reflecting ongoing confidence in the joint venture\u2019s role in enhancing COP\u2019s LNG position. APLNG continued to produce CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins, selling natural gas domestically and exporting LNG under long-term agreements and spot cargoes to Asia Pacific markets. This evolution in investment value and ownership stake demonstrates a strategic recalibration rather than retreat, maintaining COP\u2019s access to critical CBM reserves and LNG infrastructure despite earlier financial setbacks.",

We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, a majority of Hess stockholders voted to approve the merger. Following the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) review of the transaction, on September 30, 2024, the FTC announced that a majority of the Commission voted to accept a consent agreement among the FTC, Chevron and Hess, resolving the concerns the FTC identified during its review of the transaction. Chevron and Hess have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to maintain our ability to close the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended. The filing of an arbitration relating to the right of first refusal contained in the Stabroek Block operating agreement among Hess Guyana Exploration Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hess, and affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation has delayed completion of the transaction.

The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, a majority of Hess stockholders voted to approve the merger. Following the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) review of the transaction, on September 30, 2024, the FTC announced that a majority of the Commission voted to accept a consent agreement among the FTC, Chevron and Hess, resolving the concerns the FTC identified during its review of the transaction. Chevron and Hess have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to maintain our ability to close the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended. The filing of an arbitration relating to the right of first refusal contained in the Stabroek Block operating agreement among Hess Guyana Exploration Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hess, and affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation has delayed completion of the transaction. An arbitration decision against Hess G uyana and in favor of Exxon G uyana and CNOOC G uyana would cause the transaction not to be completed. The arbitration merits hearing has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in approximately the following three months.\n\nChevron and  Hess  are  working  to  complete  the  merger  as  soon  as  practicable.  However,  neither  Chevron  nor  Hess  can  predict  the  actual  date  on  which  the transaction will be completed, if at all, because it is subject to conditions beyond each company's control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to the Hess acquisition.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil's gas production rights in Qatar were described as being initially granted for 25 years, with extensions subject to the approval of the State of Qatar. By 2024, this structure remained unchanged, with the State of Qatar continuing to regulate and control the terms of these rights, including the ability to approve or deny extensions.

Operations  under  these  pre-1969  OMLs  are  conducted  under  a  joint  venture agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC. Commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the Petroleum Profits Tax Act.\n\nOMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction  for  onshore  or  offshore  location  and  are  renewable,  upon  12-months  written  notice,  for  another  period  of  20  years. OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first 10 years of their duration.\n\n## ASIA\n\n## Azerbaijan\n\nThe production sharing  agreement  (PSA)  for  the  development  of  the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli  field  was  established  for  an  initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA was amended in September 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049.\n\n## Indonesia\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  in  Indonesia  are  generally  governed  by  cooperation  contracts,  usually  in  the  form  of  a production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and  gas  activities.  In  2012,  Indonesia's  Constitutional  Court  ruled  certain  articles  of  law  relating  to  BPMIGAS  to  be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing PSCs signed with BPMIGAS should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties previously performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry of the Government of Indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law. By presidential decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended once for a period of four years with a total contract period of 30 years including an exploitation period. PSC terms can be extended for a maximum of 20 years for each extension with the approval of the government.\n\n## Iraq\n\nDevelopment and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a contract with Basra Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to participate in the development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil and gas field effective March 1, 2010. The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. The contract provides for cost recovery plus perbarrel fees for incremental production above specified levels.\n\n## Kazakhstan\n\nOnshore  exploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  the  production  license,  exploration  license,  and  joint  venture agreements  negotiated  with  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan.  Existing  production  operations  have  a  40-year  production  period  that commenced in 1993.\n\nOffshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two 10-year extensions.\n\n## Malaysia\n\nProduction activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have production terms of 25 years. Extensions are generally subject to the national oil company's prior written approval.\n\n## Qatar\n\nThe State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects.  The  initial  terms  for  these  rights  generally  extend  for  25  years.  Extensions  and  terms  are  subject  to  State  of  Qatar approval.\n\n## Russia\n\nTerms for ExxonMobil's Sakhalin acreage are fixed by the current production sharing agreement between the Russian government and the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the operator.",

In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2024 proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master's degree in reservoir engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 20 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n138",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' application of ASC Topic 815 accounting standards in 2022 relate to the financial performance of the PALNG joint venture in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate hedge accounting treatments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips applied ASC Topic 815 for derivative accounting on gas sales contracts where the net-price not-sufficiently-pegged (NPNS) election was not made, indicating a reliance on market-based variable consideration. By 2024, PALNG, in which COP held a $1.5 billion equity investment, had executed interest rate swaps covering 60% of its term loans, which were initially accounted for under ASC Topic 815 as cash flow hedges. However, in 2024, a portion of these swaps was de-designated, resulting in $35 million of unrealized losses being recognized directly in earnings via 'Equity in earnings of affiliates'. This shift from hedge accounting to mark-to-market treatment likely increased earnings volatility attributable to COP\u2019s PALNG investment compared to earlier expectations under full hedge accounting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 ASC Topic 815: COP applied ASC Topic 815 for derivative accounting on certain gas sales contracts without the NPNS election.",

        "Hop 3: PALNG \u2190 COP(2024): COP held a $1.5 billion equity investment in PALNG in 2024, and recognized $35 million in equity earnings tied to the de-designated swaps."

          "chunk_text": "## Practical Expedients\n\nTypically,  our commodity sales contracts are less than 12 months in duration; however,  in certain specific cases may extend longer, which may be out to the end of field life. We have long-term commodity sales contracts which use prevailing market prices at the time of delivery, and under these contracts, the market-based variable consideration for each performance obligation (i.e., delivery of commodity) is allocated to each wholly unsatisfied performance obligation within the contract. Accordingly,we have applied the practical expedient allowed in ASC Topic 606 and do not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations or when we expect to recognize revenues that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Receivables and Contract Liabilities\n\n## Receivables from Contracts with Customers\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the 'Accounts and notes receivable' line on our consolidated balance sheet included trade receivables of $5,268 million compared with $1,827 million at December 31, 2020, and included both contracts with customers within the scope of ASC Topic 606 and those that are outside the scope of ASC Topic  606.  We typically receive payment within 30 days or less (depending on the terms of the invoice) once delivery is made. Revenues that are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606 relate primarily to physical gas sales contracts at market prices for which we do not elect NPNS and are therefore accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815.  There is little distinction in the nature of the customer or credit quality of trade receivables  associated with gas sold under contracts for which NPNS has not been elected compared with trade receivables where NPNS has been elected.\n\n## Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n\nWe have entered into contractual arrangements where we license proprietary technology to customers related to the optimization process for operating LNG plants. The agreements typically provide for negotiated payments to be made at stated milestones. The payments are not directly related to our performance under the contract and are recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue when the customer can utilize and benefit from their right to use the license. Payments are received in installments over the construction period.\n\n",

Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

Operations include two central processing facilities for treatment and blending of bitumen.  At December 31, 2021, we held approximately 600,000 net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta.\n\nThe Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta.  Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total Energies SE that offers long-lived, sustained production.  We are focused on structurally lowering costs,  reducing GHG intensity and optimizing asset performance.\n\nIn 2021, we began processing a portion of Surmont's blended bitumen at the Diluent Recovery Unit constructed in Alberta, unlocking additional value for the asset by providing market access to our heavy crude oil.\n\nIn 2019, Surmont implemented the use of condensate for bitumen blending through the central processing facility 2; enabling the asset to lower blend ratio  and diluent supply costs, gain protection from synthetic crude oil supply disruptions and gain optionality on sales products.  The alternative blend project was complete in October at central processing facility 1.  Full Surmont Heavy Dilbit (condensate bitumen blend) was produced across both facilities in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n## Montney\n\nThe Montney is an unconventional resource play located in northeastern British Columbia.

Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million.

      "question": "How did the change in the percentage of proved reserves reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton between 2022 and 2024 reflect on the evolution of ConocoPhillips' internal reserves estimation processes and their alignment with SEC guidelines?",
      "answer": "In 2022, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) reviewed over 90% of ConocoPhillips' proved reserves as of December 31, 2021, as part of the company\u2019s internal control process to ensure compliance with SEC guidelines. By 2024, this percentage had decreased slightly to over 85% of proved reserves as of December 31, 2024. This shift suggests that while D&M's involvement remained a key component of the reserves estimation review, ConocoPhillips may have increased internal confidence or capacity in managing reserves estimation processes independently. Despite the reduced percentage, the company maintained its structured review framework involving D&M, indicating continued alignment with SEC standards and a consistent approach to reserves reporting.",

      "answer": "Chevron's 2022 reliance on crude oil as a core raw material directly influenced its continued strategic focus on TCO's crude oil fields in 2023. In 2023, TCO achieved mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP), with start-up expected in early 2025, and maintained a majority of its crude oil exports through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which transported an average of 1.4 million barrels per day. Chevron maintained a significant stake in TCO, with its proved reserves interest in TCO increasing from 1,263 billion cubic feet (BCF) in 2022 to 1,295 BCF in 2023, reflecting Chevron's ongoing commitment to the project despite broader portfolio adjustments elsewhere.

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' evolving financial exposure to coalbed methane (CBM) through APLNG change from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of guarantees and ownership stakes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips had a significant impairment of $688 million related to its investment in APLNG due to a decline in fair value, reflecting risks tied to its CBM production activities in Australia. APLNG, which produces CBM and converts it into LNG, had a nonrecourse debt balance of $5.7 billion at the end of 2021. By 2024, ConocoPhillips maintained a 47.5% ownership stake in APLNG and had multiple guarantees totaling up to $1.3 billion in maximum potential exposure, including $210 million, $610 million, and $480 million tied to various APLNG obligations. These guarantees indicate a continued but more risk-managed financial commitment to the CBM-LNG value chain compared to the impairment seen in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 CBM: COP depends on CBM as a raw material, particularly through its investment in APLNG, which produces CBM in Australia.",
        "Hop 2: CBM \u2192 APLNG: APLNG is a joint venture that produces CBM and converts it into LNG for domestic and export markets, with COP holding a significant ownership stake.",
        "Hop 3: APLNG \u2190 COP(2024): By 2024, COP maintained a 47.5% ownership in APLNG and had multiple guarantees totaling up to $1.3 billion in potential exposure, indicating ongoing financial involvement."

          "chunk_text": "\nOur share of income taxes incurred directly by an equity method investee is reported in equity in earnings of affiliates, and as such is not included in income taxes on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, retained earnings included $ 42 million related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies.  Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How did CVX's increased crude oil reserves in 2023 influence its transportation strategy through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) in 2024, and what financial commitment did this entail?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVX reported crude oil reserves of 7,682 BCF in the U.S. and a total of 28,318 BCF across all regions, indicating a significant asset base. By 2024, CVX's operations in Kazakhstan, particularly through its 50% interest in TCO and 18% interest in Karachaganak, relied heavily on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) for crude oil exports. TCO alone transported most of its 2024 crude oil production via the CPC, and Karachaganak also used the pipeline for a majority of its exports. CVX's 15% ownership in CPC, combined with the pipeline transporting an average of 1.4 million barrels per day (1.2 million from Kazakhstan and 0.2 million from Russia), reflects a strategic alignment to leverage the CPC for export efficiency. This transportation strategy was supported by a financial commitment, as CVX had a carrying value of its investment in CPC that included a loan to TCO for $4,500 million to fund development projects like the Future Growth Project (FGP), which increased production capacity by 260,000 barrels per day. Thus, the growth in reserves in 2023 directly informed CVX\u2019s 2024 transportation and investment decisions through the CPC.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX(2023) \u2192 Crude Oil: CVX reported 7,682 BCF of crude oil reserves in the U.S. and 28,318 BCF globally, showing strong upstream assets.",
        "Hop 2: Crude Oil \u2192 CPC: In 2024, TCO and Karachaganak, both partially owned by CVX, exported most of their crude oil through the CPC pipeline, transporting 1.4 million barrels per day.",
        "Hop 3: CPC \u2190 CVX(2024): CVX has a 15% interest in CPC and provided a $4,500 million loan to TCO to fund expansion projects, linking its investment directly to transportation capacity and crude oil export strategy."

At December 31, 2024, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $73 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from  Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP) with a principal balance of $4,500.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG  Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.

By 2024, COP had multiple guarantees tied to APLNG, including a $210 million guarantee related to a project finance reserve account withdrawal, a $610 million (up to $1.0 billion in case of intentional breach) guarantee tied to natural gas delivery commitments, and a $480 million guarantee for performance on other contracts. These guarantees, with terms ranging from 6 to 21 years, indicate that COP's exposure to APLNG's operational risks increased from 2023 to 2024, despite the long-standing partnership with Origin Energy.",

We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How did Chevron's $0.7 billion investment in Nigerian offshore and gas projects in 2023 relate to the exploration and production activities and regulatory framework described in their 2022 filing?",
      "answer": "Chevron's $0.7 billion investment in Nigeria in 2023 focused on offshore development and natural gas projects, continuing its exploration and production activities outlined in the 2022 filing. In 2022, Chevron detailed its exploration and production activities in Nigeria, particularly in deepwater offshore areas governed by 30-year production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). These PSCs included a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period, with partial relinquishment required at the end of the exploration phase. In 2023, Chevron's investment in Nigeria was part of its broader international development strategy, which included advancing proved undeveloped reserves, particularly in offshore and gas projects. The investment aligns with Chevron's long-term approach to operate within Nigeria's regulatory framework, which allows for extended production periods under negotiated terms, ensuring the company can develop reserves efficiently while complying with local regulations.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' increased stake in APLNG through its preemption right from Origin Energy in 2021 impact the valuation and financial performance of its equity investment in APLNG by 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2021, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to acquire an additional 10% stake in APLNG from Origin Energy for $1.645 billion, which led to a fair value reassessment of its total investment. As a result, ConocoPhillips wrote down its APLNG investment to a fair value of $5,574 million, recognizing a before-tax charge of $688 million in 2021. By 2023, ConocoPhillips' investment in APLNG remained significant, with $2,684 million in dividends received during the year, indicating continued operational performance from the joint venture. The evolution of the stake through Origin Energy to a larger direct investment in APLNG reflects a strategic shift toward strengthening its LNG position in the Asia Pacific region, despite the near-term financial charge.",

          "chunk_text": "- Disciplined investments. Our goal is to achieve strong  free cash flow by exercising capital  discipline, controlling our costs, and safely  and reliably delivering production.  We expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the price cycles.  Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return  to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest  back into the business for future cash flow expansion  .\n- o Exercise capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow.  As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities.  We allocate capital  across a geographically diverse,  low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline.  Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis.  Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and G&amp;A.  In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake.  Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders.\n- o Control our costs. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority.  Using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly  in a low commodity price environment.  The ability to control our operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.\n- o Optimize our portfolio. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho and Shell's Permian assets, significantly increasing our unconventional portfolio with many additional years of low cost of supply inventory.  The addition of this highly complementary acreage in the Midland and Delaware basins created a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48.  In our Asia Pacific segment, we notified Origin Energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG and announced the sale of our interests in Indonesia. See Note 3 .\n\nWe continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that don't compete.  As such, in conjunction with our Shell Permian acquisition announcement, we communicated an increase in our planned disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023 as part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts.\n\n- o Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:\n- \u25fe Acquire interest in existing  or new fields.\n- \u25fe Apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.\n- \u25fe Successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.\n\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.  This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron reported a net decrease of 107 million BOE to proved undeveloped reserves at TCO in Kazakhstan, primarily due to performance-driven reservoir model changes. Despite this reduction, TCO achieved mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP) in 2023, with start-up expected in the first half of 2025 and full production ramp-up within three months. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which Chevron has a 15% interest, completed a debottlenecking project in January 2023, increasing throughput capacity to support FGP's start-up. In 2024, Chevron's crude oil production strategy relied heavily on the FGP's anticipated ramp-up and the expanded CPC export infrastructure to offset the earlier reserve decreases and drive production growth.",

Shortly after the acquisition, the entity was rebranded as Beyond6, LLC. By 2023, Chevron reported that it participated in the RNG value chain through Beyond6, LLC and its nationwide network of 56 compressed natural gas stations.

CPChem continued engineering on RLPP as well as continued work toward FID on USGC II.\n\nChevron also  maintains  a  role  in  the  petrochemical  business  through  the  operations  of  GSC,  the  company's  50  percent-owned affiliate. GSC manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These base chemicals are used to produce a range of products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GSC also produces polypropylene, which is used to make automotive and home appliance parts, food packaging, laboratory equipment and textiles.\n\nFirst  production  from  the  olefins  mixed-feed  cracker  and  associated  polyethylene  unit  within  the  existing  refining  and petrochemical facilities in Yeosu, South Korea was achieved in June 2021, ahead of schedule and under budget.\n\n## Renewable Fuels\n\nThe  company  continued  to  advance  lower  carbon  actions  in  the  downstream  business,  particularly  through  development  of renewable fuels, which include renewable natural gas (RNG), renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable base oils and lubricants. The company has two partnerships to produce and market dairy biomethane, with CalBioGas and Brightmark RNG Holdings. In fourth quarter 2021, Brightmark RNG Holdings delivered first RNG. Separately, all CalBioGas farms are now online. In June 2021, the company announced its first branded compressed natural gas (CNG) site as part of its plan to have more than 30 CNG sites in California supplied with RNG by 2025. In October 2021, the company closed its acquisition of an equity interest in American Natural Gas LLC (now Beyond6, LLC) and its network of 60 CNG retail sites, in order to meet customers' needs beyond California.\n\nProgress has continued at the company's El Segundo Refinery in California to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel through the co-processing of bio-feedstock. In third quarter 2021, the refinery began co-processing about 2,000 barrels per day of bio-feedstock, producing renewable diesel at a diesel hydrotreating unit as well as a batch of sustainable aviation fuel at a fluid catalytic cracking unit. In 2022, the company expects to convert the same diesel hydrotreater at the El Segundo refinery to 100 percent renewable capability, increasing capacity to 10,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel.\n\nThe company continues development of renewable base oil through our patented technology and majority ownership in Novvi and has made progress integrating this renewable base oil into Chevron's lubricant product lines. Chevron developed Havoline Pro-RS, with lifecycle emissions that are 35 percent lower than those of conventional motor oil of equal viscosity. In November 2021, the company  made  this  renewable  based  lubricant  available  to  professional  installers  in  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  it  is expected to be available to U.S. consumers in early 2022.\n\n## Transportation\n\nPipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect  interests  in  other  U.S.  and  international  pipelines.  Chevron  acquired  all  of  the  outstanding  common  units  of  Noble Midstream Partners LP not already owned by Chevron or any of its affiliates in May 2021.\n\nRefer  to  pages  13  and  14  in  the  Upstream  section  for  information  on  the  West African  Gas  Pipeline  and  the  Caspian  Pipeline Consortium.\n\nShipping The company's marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign flagged vessels. The operated fleet consists of conventional crude tankers, product carriers and LNG carriers. These vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstock in support of  the  company's  global  upstream  and  downstream  businesses.  In  December  2021,  Chevron  joined  the  Sea  Cargo  Charter,  a benchmark initiative for responsible shipping activities, transparent greenhouse gas reporting, and improved decision making in line with the United Nations' decarbonization targets.\n\n## Other Businesses\n\nChevron Technical Center The company's technical center provides expertise to drive the application of technology, initiatives to transform  Chevron's  digital  future,  and  innovative  breakthrough  technologies  to  support  the  future  of  energy.

In October 2021, the company closed its acquisition of an equity interest in American Natural Gas LLC (now Beyond6, LLC) and its network of 60 CNG retail sites, in order to meet customers' needs beyond California.\n\nProgress has continued at the company's El Segundo Refinery in California to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel through the co-processing of bio-feedstock. In third quarter 2021, the refinery began co-processing about 2,000 barrels per day of bio-feedstock, producing renewable diesel at a diesel hydrotreating unit as well as a batch of sustainable aviation fuel at a fluid catalytic cracking unit. In 2022, the company expects to convert the same diesel hydrotreater at the El Segundo refinery to 100 percent renewable capability, increasing capacity to 10,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel.\n\nThe company continues development of renewable base oil through our patented technology and majority ownership in Novvi and has made progress integrating this renewable base oil into Chevron's lubricant product lines. Chevron developed Havoline Pro-RS, with lifecycle emissions that are 35 percent lower than those of conventional motor oil of equal viscosity. In November 2021, the company  made  this  renewable  based  lubricant  available  to  professional  installers  in  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  it  is expected to be available to U.S. consumers in early 2022.\n\n## Transportation\n\nPipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect  interests  in  other  U.S.  and  international  pipelines.  Chevron  acquired  all  of  the  outstanding  common  units  of  Noble Midstream Partners LP not already owned by Chevron or any of its affiliates in May 2021.\n\nRefer  to  pages  13  and  14  in  the  Upstream  section  for  information  on  the  West African  Gas  Pipeline  and  the  Caspian  Pipeline Consortium.\n\nShipping The company's marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign flagged vessels. The operated fleet consists of conventional crude tankers, product carriers and LNG carriers. These vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstock in support of  the  company's  global  upstream  and  downstream  businesses.  In  December  2021,  Chevron  joined  the  Sea  Cargo  Charter,  a benchmark initiative for responsible shipping activities, transparent greenhouse gas reporting, and improved decision making in line with the United Nations' decarbonization targets.\n\n## Other Businesses\n\nChevron Technical Center The company's technical center provides expertise to drive the application of technology, initiatives to transform  Chevron's  digital  future,  and  innovative  breakthrough  technologies  to  support  the  future  of  energy.  The  organization conducts  research,  develops  and  qualifies  technology,  and  provides  technical  services  and  competency  development.  The disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions,",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron operated in Angola and held an equity interest in Angola LNG, which contributed to upstream-related earnings (as noted in the 2021 results). By 2024, Chevron maintained its strategic involvement through a 36.4% ownership stake in Angola LNG, which processes and liquefies natural gas for international markets. This continuity in investment suggests a sustained focus on monetizing Angolan natural gas through LNG exports, despite broader changes in Chevron\u2019s global portfolio. The specific stake percentage in 2024 indicates a deliberate long-term positioning in the African LNG market.",

At December 31, 2024, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $73 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from  Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP) with a principal balance of $4,500.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG  Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. Included in the investment balance is a loan with a principal balance of $669 to fund a portion of the G olden Triangle Polymers Project in Orange, Texas, in which Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC owns 51 percent.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, produces and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.\n\nOther Information 'Sales and other operating revenues' on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $13,850, $13,623 and $16,286 with affiliated companies for 2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.

      "question": "How did the change in the scope of DeGolyer and MacNaughton's review of ConocoPhillips' reserves estimation processes\u2014from covering over 90% in 2021 to over 85% in 2024\u2014reflect a shift in the company's reliance on third-party validation, and what might this indicate about the evolution of ConocoPhillips' internal reserves controls?",
      "answer": "In 2021, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) reviewed processes covering over 90% of ConocoPhillips' proved reserves, indicating a high level of third-party oversight. By 2024, this coverage had decreased slightly to over 85%, suggesting a modest reduction in the scope of external validation. This change implies that ConocoPhillips may have placed greater confidence in its internal reserves controls over time, potentially reflecting improvements in internal processes or a strategic shift toward self-reliance in reserves estimation. The continued presence of D&M in the internal review team and their role in validating adherence to SEC guidelines shows that third-party input remains a key component, albeit with a slightly reduced footprint. This evolution in the entity chain suggests a maturation of internal controls and a recalibrated balance between external assurance and internal governance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil was subject to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) in Nigeria that typically span 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period, with potential extensions subject to partial relinquishment under the Petroleum Industry Act. These contracts governed ExxonMobil's operational footprint and investment decisions in the region. By 2023, the long-lived asset value associated with Nigeria had decreased from $4,090 million in 2022 to $3,319 million, reflecting a reduction of $771 million.

          "chunk_text": "ExxonMobil's investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks, and leases. The terms  and  conditions  under  which  the  Corporation  maintains  exploration  and/or  production  rights  to  the  acreage  are  propertyspecific, contractually defined, and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.\n\n## D. Summary of Acreage Terms\n\n## UNITED STATES\n\nOil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners. Leases typically have an exploration period ranging  from  one  to  ten  years,  and  a  production  period  that  normally  remains  in  effect  until  production  ceases.  Under  certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private property, a 'fee interest' is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.\n\n## CANADA / OTHER AMERICAS\n\n## Canada\n\nExploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a term  of  nine  years.  Offshore  production  licenses  are  valid  for  25  years,  with  rights  of  extension  for  continued  production. Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term.\n\n## Argentina\n\nThe  Federal  Hydrocarbon  Law  was  amended  in  2014.  Pursuant  to  the  amended  law,  the  production  term  for  an  onshore unconventional concession is 35 years, and 25 years for a conventional concession, with unlimited 10-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years, divided  into  two  exploration  periods  of  four  years,  with  an  optional  extension  of  five  years  for  each  license.  Two  onshore exploration  concessions  were  initially  granted  prior  to  the  amendment  and  are  governed  under  Provincial  Law  with  expiration terms through 2024.\n\n## Brazil\n\nThe exploration and production of oil and gas are governed by concession contracts and production sharing contracts. Concession contracts  provide  for  an  exploration  period  of  up  to  8  years  and  a  production  period  of  27  years.  Production  sharing  contracts provide for an exploration period of up to 7 years and a production period of up to 28 years.\n\n## Guyana\n\nThe  Petroleum  (Exploration  and  Production)  Act  authorizes  the  government  of  Guyana  to  grant  petroleum  prospecting  and production  licenses  and  to  enter  into  petroleum  agreements  for  the  exploration  and  production  of  hydrocarbons.  Petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years and a production period of 20 years, with a 10-year extension.\n\n## EUROPE\n\n## Germany\n\nExploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nUnder the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips wrote down its investment in APLNG to a fair value of $5,574 million, recognizing a before-tax charge of $688 million due to the sale of Origin Energy\u2019s 10% interest and the resulting market valuation being below carrying value. By 2024, ConocoPhillips held a 47.5% stake in APLNG, which produces CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Australia. The carrying value of this investment had increased to approximately $5.0 billion by the end of 2024, indicating a recovery and revaluation of the APLNG asset. This suggests that despite the earlier impairment, the company maintained and potentially strengthened its position in CBM production and LNG export capacity through APLNG.",

Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

In 2023, D&M continued to perform a similar review, again assessing over 90% of proved reserves, indicating that the company maintained a consistent third-party validation process. The continued involvement of D&M, as disclosed in both years' reserves processes, suggests that ConocoPhillips preserved the rigor and transparency of its reserves estimation framework, aligning with its SEC-compliant internal policy.

This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world.  As part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting.  This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;M), a third -party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business units' reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences  and review of documentation.  In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management.  The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year.  All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.\n\nDuring 2021, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2021, were reviewed by D&amp;M.  The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations.  In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves.  The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria.  Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls.  D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2021, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions.  D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting.  This individual holds a master's degree in petroleum engineering.  He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 25 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise.  See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "We have a company  -wide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves.  This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world.  As part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting.  This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;M), a third -party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business units' reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences  and review of documentation.  In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management.  The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year.  All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.\n\nDuring 2021, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2021, were reviewed by D&amp;M.  The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations.  In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves.  The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria.  Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls.  D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2021, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions.  D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting.  This individual holds a master's degree in petroleum engineering.  He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 25 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise.  See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a major subsidiary of CVX, was responsible for a significant portion of the company's upstream operations, including the production of natural gas liquids (NGLs), with 450 million barrels of NGLs reported in U.S. proved developed reserves. By 2024, CVX's consolidated production had increased to 683 million barrels of NGLs in the U.S. This indicates a strategic focus on expanding NGL production within the U.S., likely driven by stronger domestic demand and improved extraction technologies. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.'s role as the primary operator of U.S. businesses aligns with this trajectory, showing a clear evolution from being a key production entity in 2022 to facilitating a broader upstream growth strategy by 2024.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' increased ownership stake in APLNG between 2022 and 2023 reflect changes in the valuation of the joint venture, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic positioning in Queensland's LNG market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips held a 37.5% stake in APLNG, a joint venture focused on producing coal bed methane (CBM) and exporting LNG from Queensland, Australia. During 2021, Origin Energy sold a 10% stake in APLNG, and ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to acquire this additional interest. However, due to a fair value assessment, ConocoPhillips wrote down its APLNG investment to $5,574 million in 2021, recognizing a before-tax charge of $688 million. By 2023, despite the write-down, ConocoPhillips maintained a significant role in APLNG, operating the LNG facility and benefiting from long-term sales agreements and a $4.7 billion outstanding project finance facility. This indicates a strategic commitment to maintaining influence in Queensland\u2019s LNG sector despite short-term valuation challenges.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 Queensland, Australia: COP operated in Queensland through its 37.5% stake in APLNG in 2022.",

        "Hop 3: APLNG \u2190 COP(2023): COP retained its stake in APLNG in 2023 and continued to operate the LNG facility, despite a prior valuation write-down."

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% interest in APLNG, which led to a fair value write-down of its investment to $5,574 million, resulting in a $688 million before-tax charge. This investment positioned ConocoPhillips more strongly in APLNG, a joint venture focused on producing coal bed methane (CBM) and exporting LNG from Queensland, Australia. By 2023, ConocoPhillips held a 47.5% ownership stake in APLNG, which directly supported its operational presence in Queensland. APLNG's LNG export activities, primarily targeting Asia Pacific markets, were a key part of ConocoPhillips' broader LNG strategy, with the company operating the LNG facility while Origin Energy managed production and pipelines. The increased stake and continued involvement in APLNG in 2023 reflected a strategic commitment to maintaining a strong foothold in Queensland\u2019s LNG sector.",

By 2024, this engagement had evolved into a more structured annual review process where DeGolyer and MacNaughton assessed over 85% of ConocoPhillips' proved reserves as of December 31, 2024, specifically evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls against SEC regulations. Their review included on-site visits, teleconferences, and documentation review, culminating in a conclusion that ConocoPhillips' processes and controls were in accordance with SEC reserves definitions.

This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world.

This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business unit's reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.\n\nDuring 2024, our processes and controls used to assess over 85 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2024, were reviewed by D&amp;M. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2024 proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master's degree in reservoir engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 20 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise.

This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business unit's reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.\n\nDuring 2024, our processes and controls used to assess over 85 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2024, were reviewed by D&amp;M. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2024 proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master's degree in reservoir engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 20 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n138",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' financial exposure through its stake in APLNG change in 2024 compared to 2023, particularly in relation to its involvement with coalbed methane (CBM) production in Australia?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips had a significant stake in APLNG, a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. APLNG had an outstanding balance of $4.7 billion in project finance facilities, with COP benefiting from access to CBM resources and enhanced LNG positioning. By 2024, COP\u2019s financial exposure to APLNG had evolved, with guarantees totaling up to $1.3 billion in maximum potential liabilities, including $210 million tied to a project finance reserve guarantee, $610 million related to gas delivery obligations, and $480 million for performance contracts. This represents a shift from 2023, where the focus was on equity earnings and dividends, to 2024, where risk management through guarantees became more prominent.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 CBM: COP was subject to coalbed methane (CBM) as a raw material in its 2023 operations, particularly through its investment in APLNG.",
        "Hop 2: CBM \u2192 APLNG: APLNG was directly involved in the production of CBM in Australia, which was then processed into LNG for domestic and international markets.",
        "Hop 3: APLNG \u2190 COP(2024): In 2024, COP maintained its stake in APLNG but faced increased financial guarantees totaling up to $1.3 billion, indicating a shift in risk exposure related to CBM production and delivery obligations."

          "chunk_text": "At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "question": "How did the change in the percentage of proved reserves reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton from 2022 to 2024 reflect on the evolution of ConocoPhillips' internal reserves estimation processes and their alignment with SEC compliance standards?",
      "answer": "In 2022, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) reviewed processes and controls used to assess over 90% of ConocoPhillips' proved reserves as of December 31, 2021. By 2024, this percentage had decreased to over 85% of proved reserves as of December 31, 2024. This reduction indicates a slight shift in the scope of D&M\u2019s involvement, suggesting that ConocoPhillips may have increased internal confidence in its reserves estimation processes, which are governed by a comprehensive SEC-compliant policy.

This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world.  As part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting.  This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;M), a third -party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business units' reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences  and review of documentation.  In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management.  The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year.  All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.\n\nDuring 2021, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2021, were reviewed by D&amp;M.

In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves.  The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria.  Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls.  D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2021, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions.

These non-recurring costs related primarily to employee severance and related benefits, fees paid to advisors and the settlement of share-based awards for certain Marathon Oil employees based on the terms of the Merger Agreement. These transaction-related costs included $328 million of employee severance expense. See Note 15 .\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, \"Total Revenues and Other Income\" and \"Net Income (Loss)\" associated with the acquired assets were $677 million and i ncome of $66 million, respectively.\n\n## Alaska Acquisition\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, after exercising our preferential rights, we completed an acquisition that increased our working interest by approximately 5 percent in the Kuparuk River Unit and approximately 0.4 percent in the Prudhoe Bay Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Union Oil Company of California for $296 million, before customary adjustments. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, with the consideration allocated primarily to PP&amp;E.\n\n## Assets Held For Sale\n\nIn December 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment for $235 million, before customary adjustments. These assets have a net carrying value of approximately $235 million, which consists primarily of $251 million of PP&amp;E and $16 million of l i a bi l i ti es , pri ma ri l y noncurrent AROs. These assets met held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter of 2024, and as of December 31, 2024, we reclassified the PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and the noncurrent liabilities to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.

      "answer": "In 2022, COP's operations in the Gulf of Mexico were part of the Lower 48 segment, which contributed 64% of consolidated natural gas production. By 2023, the Lower 48 became COP's largest segment, contributing 76% of natural gas production, indicating a stronger operational focus. This shift was accompanied by an increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expenses for the Lower 48, rising from $4,854 million in 2022 to $5,729 million in 2023. The growing emphasis on the Lower 48, including the Gulf of Mexico, thus led to higher DD&A costs, reflecting increased capital investment and production activity in the region.",

As of March 31, 2021, we had settled all oil and gas hedging positions acquired from Concho. See Note 12.\n\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico.  During 2021, the Lower 48 contributed 55 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 64 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $4,932 million in 2021, compared with a loss of $1,122 million in 2020.  Earnings were positively impacted by:\n\n- Higher realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices.\n- Higher sales volumes due to our Concho acquisition and the absence of production curtailments.\n- Lower impairments, primarily related to developed properties in our noncore assets which were written down to fair value due to lower commodity prices and development plan changes.  See Note 7 and Note 13 .\n- Higher gains on dispositions related to selling our interests in certain noncore assets. See Note 3 .\n\n## Earnings were negatively impacted by:\n\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses, production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes primarily due to higher production volumes.  Partially offsetting the increase in DD&amp;A expenses were lower rates from price-related reserve revisions.\n- Impacts resulting from our Concho acquisition, including higher selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction and restructuring charges, as well as realized losses on derivative settlements. See Note 3 and Note 12 .\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 395 MBOED in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to:\n\n- Higher volumes due to our Concho acquisition.\n- New wells online from our development programs in Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken.\n- Absence of curtailments.\n\nThese production increases were partly offset by:\n\n- Normal field decline.\n\n## 47 ConocoPhillips  2021 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "We have a company-wide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business unit's reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.\n\nDuring 2024, our processes and controls used to assess over 85 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2024, were reviewed by D&amp;M. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips' technical staff presented D&amp;M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management's intent in retaining D&amp;M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&amp;M's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2024 proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&amp;M's report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master's degree in reservoir engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 20 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international field locations.\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n138",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in 2023, which added over 700 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day of production from Pioneer's operations, contributed to a significant increase in ExxonMobil's total daily production. By 2024, ExxonMobil's production had risen to 4.3 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 595 thousand barrels per day from 2023. This indicates that the merger substantially boosted ExxonMobil's upstream capacity, with growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana more than offsetting production declines from divestments and entitlements.",

We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million.

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' evolving stake in APLNG between 2022 and 2024 reflect changes in their strategic positioning in Queensland, Australia, particularly in light of the 2021 impairment and subsequent guarantee liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips held a 37.5% stake in APLNG, which operated in Queensland, Australia, and was already under financial strain, as evidenced by the $688 million impairment recorded in 2021 due to a decline in APLNG's fair value. By 2024, ConocoPhillips had increased its stake to 47.5%, signaling a renewed strategic commitment to the venture despite ongoing liabilities, including $210 million, $610 million, and $480 million in performance and contingent guarantees tied to APLNG. This evolution suggests that although the company recognized a significant impairment just two years prior, it remained committed to leveraging APLNG\u2019s LNG export capabilities in Queensland, now with increased exposure to both upside potential and downside risk.",

Dividends received from affiliates were $1,279 million, $1,076 million and $1,378 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets.  Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP applied ASC Topic 815 for certain physical gas sales contracts at market prices for which they did not elect NPNS, treating them as derivatives. This accounting treatment was noted alongside a receivables balance of $4,414 million from contracts with customers. In 2024, PALNG, in which COP holds a $1.5 billion equity investment, de-designated a portion of its interest rate swaps previously accounted for under ASC Topic 815 as cash flow hedges. This change resulted in $35 million of unrealized losses being recognized directly in 'Equity in earnings of affiliates' on COP\u2019s consolidated income statement.

These swaps were designated and qualified for hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815, 'Derivatives and Hedging,' as a cash flow hedge with changes in the fair value of the designated hedging instruments reported as a component of other comprehensive income and to be reclassified into earnings in the same periods that the hedged transactions will affect earnings.\n\nIn 2024, PALNG de-designated a portion of the interest rate swaps as a cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value of the de-designated hedging instruments are reported in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line on our consolidated income statement.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, we recognized an unrealized loss of $56 million and an unrealized gain of $78 million in other comprehensive income, respectively, related to the hedge accounted swaps. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $35 million in \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" related to the de-designated swaps.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nWe invest in financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various accounts and currency pools we manage.

Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' 2021 impairment of its APLNG investment relate to the evolution of COP's financial guarantees tied to APLNG from 2022 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2021, COP recorded a $688 million noncash impairment on its APLNG investment due to a decline in fair value below carrying value, triggered by Origin Energy's sale of a 10% stake at a lower valuation. By 2024, COP's financial guarantees tied to APLNG totaled $1.3 billion in maximum potential exposure, including $210 million for a project finance reserve guarantee, $610 million for natural gas delivery commitments, and $480 million for performance guarantees. This indicates that while the investment was impaired in 2021, COP's financial exposure to APLNG remained significant through guarantees two years later, suggesting continued strategic commitment despite earlier valuation concerns.",

Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.  The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets.  Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nAPLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012.  All amounts were drawn from the facility.  APLNG achieved financial completion on its original $ 8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility  being nonrecourse.  The project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at December 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities.  APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until September 2030.  At December 31, 2021, a balance of $ 5.7 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% stake in APLNG, increasing its total ownership (as evidenced by the $1.645 billion purchase and the resulting write-down of its investment to $5,574 million). By 2023, ConocoPhillips held a 47.5% equity stake in APLNG, which directly enhanced its access to coal bed methane (CBM) resources in Queensland, Australia. APLNG's core activity of producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins provided COP with a strategic foothold in the Australian CBM market, which in turn strengthened COP\u2019s LNG export capabilities to the Asia Pacific region. This evolution reflects a deliberate strategic move to increase both equity control and upstream resource exposure over a one-year period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron disclosed that the latest finalized tax audit in Kazakhstan was for the year 2012, indicating a long gap in resolved tax examinations in the country. This unresolved tax position may have contributed to financial uncertainty or strategic caution in its operations there. By 2023, Chevron had a 50% equity ownership in Tengizchevroil (TCO), and its investment included a $4,500 loan to TCO to fund the Future Growth Project and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP/WPMP). The significant funding commitment in 2023 suggests that despite ongoing tax uncertainties from earlier years, Chevron increased its operational and financial stake in Kazakhstan through TCO, potentially signaling confidence in long-term stability or strategic alignment in the region.",

For the company's major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2021.

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron's upstream operations in Kazakhstan were in earlier stages, with crude oil exports relying on CPC but without the full throughput capacity that would be enabled by the 2023 debottlenecking project. By 2023, Chevron's TCO joint venture in Kazakhstan achieved mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP), which was set to ramp up production by mid-2025. This increase in production capacity aligned with the January 2023 mechanical completion of the CPC debottlenecking project, which increased pipeline throughput capacity. CPC transported an average of 1.4 million barrels per day in 2023, including 1.2 million from Kazakhstan and 0.2 million from Russia, supporting Chevron's expanded export needs. Thus, Chevron's 2023 operations showed a stronger dependency on CPC due to both increased production and improved pipeline infrastructure.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' financial valuation of its APLNG stake in 2023 reflect changes in its dependency on CBM resources compared to 2022, and what does this reveal about the company's evolving investment strategy in Australian LNG production?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips (COP) was shown to depend on CBM (coalbed methane) as a key raw material, highlighting its strategic reliance on unconventional gas sources. By 2023, COP's investment in APLNG\u2014a joint venture focused on CBM production in Australia\u2014was written down to a fair value of $5,574 million, down from a carrying value that necessitated a $688 million before-tax charge. This write-down indicates a reassessment of the asset's value, even as COP continued to emphasize APLNG's role in enhancing its LNG position. Despite the valuation adjustment, the ongoing operation of APLNG's LNG facility and its production from CBM resources in Queensland suggests that COP maintained its operational reliance on CBM. This reveals a nuanced shift in investment strategy: while the financial valuation of the APLNG stake was reduced, the company's operational focus on CBM and its commitment to LNG exports to the Asia-Pacific market remained intact.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 CBM: COP identified CBM as a critical raw material in its 2022 filing, indicating its reliance on this resource for production.",
        "Hop 2: CBM \u2192 APLNG: APLNG is explicitly described as a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, linking CBM directly to APLNG's operations.",
        "Hop 3: APLNG \u2190 COP(2023): In 2023, COP's stake in APLNG was written down to a fair value of $5,574 million, with a before-tax charge of $688 million, showing a financial reevaluation of the asset while maintaining operational involvement in CBM production."

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron reported income from equity affiliates of $8,585 million, with Angola LNG specifically mentioned as a contributor to upstream-related earnings. By 2023, this income from equity affiliates had decreased to $5,131 million, with the decline attributed to lower upstream-related earnings from Angola LNG. This indicates a reduction in the profitability of Chevron's upstream operations in Angola, as Angola LNG was a key component of their equity affiliate performance in that region. The specific reference to Angola LNG in both years underscores its material role in Chevron\u2019s upstream earnings from Angola, and the decline suggests operational or market challenges affecting this affiliate during the period.",

        "Hop 1: [CVX](2022) \u2192 [Angola]: Chevron had equity interests in affiliates operating in Angola, including Angola LNG, as noted in the 2022 10-K filing.",

      "question": "How did the change in ConocoPhillips' equity investment valuation in APLNG from 2023 to 2024 align with the CBM production dynamics in the Bowen and Surat basins, and what does this suggest about the company's LNG strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips wrote down its investment in APLNG to a fair value of $5,574 million due to the preemption purchase of an additional 10% stake at a price below the carrying value, resulting in a $688 million before-tax charge. APLNG, which produces CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, supplies both the domestic gas market and LNG export facilities on Curtis Island. By 2024, the carrying value of ConocoPhillips' equity method investment in APLNG had increased to approximately $5.0 billion, indicating a partial recovery in valuation despite ongoing production and financing dynamics. This suggests that while the company maintained its strategic commitment to LNG through APLNG, the valuation adjustments reflect both the evolving economics of CBM production and long-term LNG market expectations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 APLNG: COP exercised a preemption right to purchase an additional 10% in APLNG, which required a write-down of the investment to $5,574 million, resulting in a $688 million before-tax charge.",
        "Hop 2: APLNG \u2192 CBM: APLNG produces coal bed methane (CBM) from the Bowen and Surat basins, which is processed into LNG and exported, primarily to Sinopec under long-term agreements.",
        "Hop 3: CBM \u2190 COP(2024): By 2024, COP maintained APLNG as a core LNG asset with a $5.0 billion carrying value, indicating continued strategic alignment with CBM-based LNG production despite earlier valuation adjustments."

          "chunk_text": "## APLNG\n\nAPLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG's production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.\n\nIn 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2024, a balance of $4.0 billion was outstanding on the facilities. See Note 9 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $5.0 billion.\n\n## PALNG\n\nPALNG is a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $1.5 billion. See Note 3 .\n\n## N3\n\nN3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from N3. Currently, the LNG from N3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.\n\n## NFE4\n\nNFE4 is a joint venture participating in the NFE LNG project. NFE4 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. See Note 3 .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a 5 percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4. See Note 9 .\n\n## NFS3\n\nNFS3 is a joint venture participating in the NFS LNG project. NFS3 has a 25 percent interest in the NFS project. See Note 3 .\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $1.4 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nAs part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n92",

      "question": "How did the 2021 impairment of ConocoPhillips' APLNG investment reflect changes in the valuation of CBM resources in Australia, and what does the 2023 carrying value of $5,574 million indicate about the long-term outlook for APLNG's CBM production and ConocoPhillips' strategic position in the Australian LNG market?",
      "answer": "In 2021, ConocoPhillips recorded a $688 million noncash impairment charge on its APLNG investment after the fair value of APLNG declined below the carrying value, driven by Origin Energy\u2019s sale of a 10% stake at a price reflecting a lower market valuation of APLNG's CBM resources in Australia. This impairment indicated concerns about the future profitability of CBM production in the region. Despite this, in 2023, the carrying value of the investment remained at $5,574 million, suggesting that ConocoPhillips maintained confidence in the long-term viability of APLNG\u2019s CBM production and its strategic role in the company's LNG portfolio. The unchanged carrying value implies that the impairment was viewed as a temporary valuation adjustment rather than a fundamental reassessment of APLNG\u2019s long-term value or ConocoPhillips' position in the Australian LNG market.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 CBM: ConocoPhillips' 2022 filings identify CBM as a key raw material, particularly in relation to its APLNG joint venture in Australia.",

        "Hop 3: APLNG \u2190 COP(2023): In 2023, the carrying value of ConocoPhillips' APLNG investment remained at $5,574 million, indicating continued strategic confidence in the long-term value of APLNG\u2019s CBM production despite the prior impairment."

See Note 10 .\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments.  ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government approvals.  The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of APLNG's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG.  Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.  Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $ 688 million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.  The impairment, which is included in the 'Impairments' line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $ 5,574 million as of December 31, 2021.  This carrying value is included in the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 .",

For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years.

An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).

Throughout the document, certain totals and percentages may not sum to their component parts due to rounding.\n\n## Business Environment and Outlook\n\nChevron Corporation is a global energy company with direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates that conduct substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia,  Bangladesh,  Brazil,  Canada,  China,  Egypt,  Equatorial  G uinea,  Israel,  Kazakhstan,  Mex ico,  Nigeria,  the  Partitioned  Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Venezuela.\n\nThe company's objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company's control. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the  company  to  adjust  operating  ex penses,  including  employee  reductions,  and  capital  ex penditures,  along  with  other  measures  intended  to  improve  financial performance.\n\nSome governments, companies, communities and other stakeholders are supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG  emissions are in various stages of design, adoption and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements; the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG  standards or disclosures and evolving standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising relating to emissions and emission reductions and removals.\n\nSome of these policies and programs include renewable and low carbon fuel standards, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S. and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard; programs that price GHG emissions, including",

      "answer": "The expiration of Chevron's exploration phase in Nigeria's A5-B block in 2023 triggered partial relinquishment requirements under Nigeria's Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which likely reduced Chevron's upstream asset base and operational flexibility in deepwater areas. This regulatory change, combined with the need to convert OPLs to OMLs upon commercial discovery, introduced additional compliance costs and uncertainty. Chevron's upstream net income from exploration and production activities in 2023 was impacted by these regulatory dynamics, as seen in the shift from the 2022 tax uncertainty related to Nigeria (with 82% of $5,288 million in unrecognized tax benefits) to the 2023 reporting of operational results that now reflect the new regulatory constraints in Nigeria\u2019s deepwater offshore areas.",

Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "question": "How did Chevron's ongoing tax audit uncertainty in Kazakhstan in 2022 relate to its operational developments at TCO in 2023, and how did this affect Chevron's proved reserves tied to TCO?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron disclosed that its tax audit in Kazakhstan had not been finalized since 2012, contributing to ongoing uncertainty around its unrecognized tax benefits. Despite this uncertainty, Chevron continued to invest in Kazakhstan through its stake in TCO. In 2023, TCO achieved mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP) and began field conversion for the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP), both of which are expected to increase production capacity starting in 2025. This operational progress contributed to an increase in TCO-related proved reserves from 1,263 BCF in 2022 to 1,295 BCF in 2023. This indicates that Chevron maintained strategic investment in TCO despite unresolved tax matters in Kazakhstan.",

        "Hop 1: CVX(2022) \u2192 Kazakhstan: Chevron had unresolved tax audits in Kazakhstan as of 2022, with the last finalized audit dating back to 2012.",

          "chunk_text": "\nApproximately 82 percent of the $5,288 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.\n\nTax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company's major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2021. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States - 2013, Nigeria - 2007, Australia - 2009, Kazakhstan - 2012 and Saudi Arabia - 2015.\n\nThe  company  engages  in  ongoing  discussions  with  tax  authorities  regarding  the  resolution  of  tax  matters  in  the  various jurisdictions.  Both  the  outcome  of  these  tax  matters  and  the  timing  of  resolution  and/or  closure  of  the  tax  audits  are  highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company's total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still  remain  subject  to  examination  and  the  number  of  matters  being  examined  in  the  various  tax  jurisdictions,  the  company  is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron's stake in Angola LNG was reflected in upstream earnings, indicating a passive financial involvement rather than active development investment. By 2023, Chevron allocated $0.7 billion toward various offshore development and natural gas projects in Angola, including Angola LNG, signaling a strategic shift toward active development. This shift is further evidenced by the 64 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves directly tied to Angola LNG, showing Chevron's intent to convert these reserves into production. This represents a clear evolution from a holding position to an active investment posture in Angola LNG-related assets.",

      "answer": "In late 2021, ConocoPhillips exercised its preemption right to purchase an additional 10% interest in APLNG, increasing its stake and triggering a $688 million impairment charge due to the fair value of APLNG being below its carrying value. This investment decision reflects a strategic commitment to the APLNG joint venture despite short-term financial pressures. By 2023, ConocoPhillips maintained its partnership with Origin Energy as a co-owner of APLNG, now holding a 47.5% stake (with Origin at 27.5%). The continued collaboration suggests that the impairment did not deter ConocoPhillips from its long-term strategic alignment with Origin Energy in the Australian CBM and LNG export market.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips produced 8 million barrels per day (MBD) of crude oil at an average sales price of $56.38 per barrel, indicating a focus on crude oil as a core revenue driver. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., as a major crude oil producer and subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, was a strategic partner in this context. In 2024, ConocoPhillips capitalized on this relationship by acquiring an additional 5% interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and 0.4% in the Prudhoe Bay Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. for $296 million. This acquisition directly expanded COP\u2019s upstream crude oil footprint in Alaska, a region with high-quality, long-lived assets. The move appears to be a continuation of their strategy to consolidate high-margin crude oil production, especially after recognizing $677 million in revenues and $66 million in net income from acquired assets in 2024, suggesting a positive early financial impact.",
