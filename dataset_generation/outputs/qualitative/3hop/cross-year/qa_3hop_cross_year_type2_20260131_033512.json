      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics highlighted its role as the systems integrator for next-generation artillery solutions and a provider of missile subsystems with critical aerostructures, control actuators, and hypersonic rocket cases. In 2023, the Combat Systems segment, which includes these offerings, accounted for 20% of consolidated revenue. By 2024, this segment's revenue had slightly decreased to 19% of consolidated revenue, indicating sustained but slightly reduced emphasis on combat systems, while continuing to emphasize next-gen missile components. This suggests a consistent strategic focus on advanced missile technologies with slight revenue fluctuation over the three-year period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics emphasized its production of missile subsystems with critical aerostructures as part of its broader Combat Systems portfolio, which included next-generation weapon systems for air and shipboard applications like those on the F-35. In 2023, the Combat Systems segment accounted for 20% of consolidated revenue, with aerostructures explicitly mentioned as part of next-generation missile provisioning. By 2024, GD continued to highlight its role in producing critical aerostructures for next-gen missiles, while the Combat Systems segment slightly declined to 19% of consolidated revenue. This indicates a consistent strategic focus on aerostructures within Combat Systems, despite slight revenue share fluctuations, underscoring GD's sustained positioning in advanced missile subsystems.",

In 2022, GE emphasized its reliance on primary insurers to file proposed rate increases with state regulators, noting that the frequency of such increases varied by ceding company.

          "chunk_text": "The primary cash flow assumptions used in the annual review include:\n\nMorbidity . M orbidity  assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care insurance exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utiliz ation (amount of av ailable benefits ex pected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last, including claim terminations due to death or recovery).\n\nRate of Change in M orbidity . Our review incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim incidence rates. These estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. This exercise of actuarial judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual review, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base assumptions, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and healthcare technology development.\n\nTerminations . Terminations include active life mortality and lapse. M ortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. Lapse refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to non-payment of premiums by a policyholder. Lapse rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment.\n\nFuture long-term care premium rate increases . Substantially all long-term care insurance policies that are currently premium paying allow the issuing insurance entity  to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. A s a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. While we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. The amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. We consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations.\n\nIncluded in Insurance losses and annuity benefits in our Statement of Earnings (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, are favorable and unfavorable pre-tax adjustments of $196 million and $(155) million, respectively, from updating the net premium ratio (i.e., the percentage of projected gross premiums required to cover expected policy benefits and related expenses) after updating for actual historical experience each quarter and updating of future cash flow assumptions in the third quarter of each year.\n\nSensitivities. The following table provides sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves using the locked-in discount rate assumption and have been estimated across the entire product line rather than at an individual cohort level. A s our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves. M any of our assumptions, which are based on our credible experience, are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below. In addition, the effects of changes to cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves may be partially or wholly reflected in the period in which the assumptions are changed and/or over future periods and may vary across cohorts.\n\n",

This exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development. With respect to industry developments, we take into account that there are differences between and among industry peers in portfolio characteristics (such as demographic features of the insured populations), the aggregate effect of morbidity improvement or deterioration as applied to base claim cost projections, the extent to which such base cost projections reflect the most current experience, and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment. We assess the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projections, reconstructed in 2017. Projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have a material impact on our future claim cost projections, both on a stand-alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variables such as discount rate and premium rate increases.\n\nMortality . Mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. For life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments.\n\nDiscount rate . Interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. In estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. Lower future investment yields result in a lower discount rate and a higher present value of future policy benefit reserves.\n\nFuture long-term care premium rate increases . Long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. As a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. While we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. The amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. We consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations. Higher future premium rate increases lower the present value of future policy benefit reserves and lower future premium rate increases increase the present value of future policy benefit reserves.\n\nTerminations . Terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. Termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment. Lower termination rates increase, while higher termination rates decrease, the present value of expected future benefit payments.\n\nIn 2017, based on elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts, we initiated a comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumptions across all insurance products, resulting in a reconstruction of our future claim cost projections for long-term care insurance products. While our long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. However, the extent of actual experience since 2017 to date is limited in the context of a long-tailed, multi-decade portfolio.\n\n2021 Premium Deficiency Testing . We completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2021. These procedures included updating experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2020, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Our 2021 premium deficiency testing started with the positive margin of less than 2% of the recorded future policy benefit reserves that resulted from our 2020 premium deficiency testing. Using updated assumptions, the 2021 premium deficiency testing results indicated a significant increase in the positive margin to approximately 11% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2021. As a result, the assumptions updated in connection with the premium deficiency recognized in 2019 remain locked-in and will remain so unless another premium deficiency occurs in the future.",

      "question": "How did GE's relationship with Electric Insurance Company evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its classification, financial exposure, and eventual divestiture?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE disclosed that Electric Insurance Company (EIC) was a captive property and casualty insurer primarily serving GE and its employees, with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, GE had classified EIC as 'held for sale' and recorded a $109 million loss in connection with the expected sale, noting EIC had assets of $541 million and liabilities of $378 million as of December 31, 2023. In 2024, GE completed the sale of EIC to Riverstone International Holdings Inc. for $120 million in cash. This progression shows a strategic shift from operational ownership to full divestiture, with a significant loss recognized during the transition.",

          "chunk_text": "## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

By 2024, GE again highlighted the persistence of these liabilities, emphasizing that additional legal proceedings were expected and that the global nature of its operations made full risk mitigation difficult, with potential adverse impacts on financial results. The trend shows a consistent and material level of exposure without significant reduction, indicating that GE's risk management strategies have not substantially mitigated these legacy liabilities over the three-year period, and the financial impact trajectory remains volatile and uncertain.",

In particular, recent trends globally  toward increased protectionism, import and export controls, required licenses or authorizations to engage in business with certain countries or entities, the use of tariffs, restrictions on outbound investment and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. In addition, changes in environmental and climate change laws, regulations or policies (including emissions pricing and taxes, emissions standards or sustainable finance, among others) affecting the aerospace and defense sector could lead to additional costs or compliance requirements, a need for additional investment in product designs, require carbon offset investments or otherwise negatively impact our business or competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our business that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, artificial intelligence, anti-corruption, competition law, public procurement law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, technical regulations or local content requirements that could result in market access criteria that our products cannot or do not meet, restrictions related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFA S), foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity  from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax  laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws such as global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income, could increase our cash tax costs and effective tax rate. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits and investigations that in the past have led, and in the future may lead, to cash withholds, fines, damages or other penalties under civil or criminal laws. Inability to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our status with government customers or our ability to participate in projects and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to bid for new U.S. government contracts or business with other government-related customers, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nLegal proceedings - We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including contingent liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives and our industry are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages that could be material. For example, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters from several years ago. These types of proceedings involving claims about past financial performance and reporting, as well as any future claims that may arise about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, may have a significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others. We also from time to time are involved in commercial discussions, disputes or proceedings in which, given the nature of our business that often involves large equipment and service orders and long-term commercial relationships, the claims asserted can be for significant amounts. The estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation, disputes and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our financial results. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly in light of the global and div erse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving our employees, partners or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to the relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. M oreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in those markets. See Note 24 for further information about legal proceedings and other loss contingencies.\n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Refer to Legal M atters and Environmental, Health and Safety M atters in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to our legal matters.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 33",

The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to changes in key economic indicators, and future decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans under ERISA. Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors, which could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility, could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans. In addition, there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current and future retirees. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to control increases in these costs will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligations, see Note 12.\n\nLEGAL &amp; COMPLIANCE RISKS. Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment, legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including matters relating to financial reporting and the environment, health and safety. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to make adverse changes to our business models or practices.\n\nRegulatory - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways. Our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. In particular, recent trends globally toward increased protectionism, import and export controls and the use of tariffs and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our businesses that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, anti-corruption, competition law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, states or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws, could increase our costs or tax rate. In addition, efforts by public and private sectors to control healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements and increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. Inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status with such customers or our ability to participate in projects, and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to do bid for business with certain government-related customers or to participate in projects involving multilateral development banks, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nLegal proceedings - We are subject to legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including trailing liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives, and the industries in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union, China and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and/or damages that could be material. For example, following our acquisition of Alstom's Thermal, Renewables and Grid businesses in 2015, we are subject to legacy legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or corruption by Alstom in the pre-acquisition period, and payments for settlements, judgments, penalties or other liabilities in connection with those matters have resulted and will in the future result in cash outflows. In addition, while in December 2020 we entered into a settlement to conclude the previously disclosed SEC investigation of GE, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters. We have observed that these proceedings related to claims about past financial performance and reporting pose particular reputational risks for the Company that can cause new allegations about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, to have a more significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others than they otherwise would. We have established reserves for legal matters when and as appropriate; however, the estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly in light of the global and diverse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving GE employees or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters.

Capital contributions shifted from cash in 2022 ($530 million) to non-cash intercompany loan forgiveness in 2023 ($1,797 million), with no incremental contributions required in 2024. These changes reflect escalating litigation risks in 2023, followed by some stabilization in 2024, though the exposure remains substantial and future adverse developments could still require additional contributions.",

Results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis.\n\nGE Vernova. On April 2, 2024, we completed the previously announced separation of GE V ernova. The separation was structured as a tax-free spin-off and was achieved through the Company's pro-rata distribution of all the outstanding shares of GE V ernova to holders of the Company's common stock. In connection with the GE Vernova separation, the historical results of GE V ernova and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in GE A erospace consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. In addition, the Company contributed $515 million of cash to fund GE V ernova's future operations such that GE Vernova's cash balance on the date of separation was $4,242 million.\n\nWe have continuing involvement with GE Vernova primarily through ongoing sales of products, a transition services agreement, through which GE A erospace and GE Vernova continue to provide certain services to each other for a period of time following the separation, a separation and distribution agreement, including performance and financial guarantees, a tax matters agreement and a trademark licensing agreement. For the nine months (post separation) ended December 31, 2024, we had direct and indirect sales of $248 million to GE V ernova, primarily related to engine sales and parts. We collected net cash of $943 million related to the transition services agreement and sales of engines and parts in 2024.\n\nGE HealthCare. On January 3, 2023, we completed the previously announced separation of our HealthCare business, into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare). The separation was structured as a tax-free spin-off and was achieved through the Company's pro-rata distribution of approximately 80.1% of the outstanding shares of GE HealthCare to holders of the Company's common stock. In connection with the separation, the historical results of GE HealthCare and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in GE A erospace consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\n\nWe have continuing involvement with GE HealthCare primarily through a transition services agreement, through which GE A erospace and GE HealthCare continue to provide certain services to each other for a period of time following the separation, a tax matters agreement and a trademark licensing agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we collected net cash of $230 million related to these activities. A s of December 31, 2024, the transition services agreement was completed.\n\nBank BPH . A s prev iously  reported, Bank BPH, along with other Polish banks, has been subject to ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of floating rate residential mortgage loans, with cases brought by individual borrowers seeking relief related to their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans in various courts throughout Poland. A s previously reported, a settlement program was adopted and we recorded a charge of $1,014 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH was $2,461 million and $2,669 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In order to maintain appropriate regulatory capital levels, in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we made the previously reported non-cash capital contributions in the form of intercompany loan forgiveness of $1,797 million; no incremental contributions from GE A erospace were required in 2024. For further information about factors that are relevant to the estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH, see Note 24. Future changes or adverse developments could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH.\n\nThe Bank BPH financing receivable portfolio is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, which reflects market yields and estimates with respect to ongoing borrower litigation. A t December 31, 2024, the total portfolio had no carrying value, net of a valuation allowance. Earnings (loss) related to ongoing borrower litigation included zero, $1,189 million and $720 million in pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n48 2024 FORM  10-K",

          "chunk_text": "We estimate potential losses for Bank BPH in connection with borrower litigation cases that are pending by recording legal reserves, as well as in connection with potential future cases or other adverse developments as part of our ongoing valuation of the Bank BPH portfolio, which we record at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. The total amount of such estimated losses was $755 million and $315 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We update our assumptions underlying the amount of estimated losses based primarily on the number of lawsuits filed and estimated to be filed in the future, whether liability will be established in lawsuits and the nature of the remedy ordered by courts if liability is established. The increase in the amount of estimated losses during 2021 was driven primarily by increases in the number of lawsuits estimated to be filed in the future and increased findings of liability. We expect the trends we have previously reported of an increasing number of lawsuits being filed, more findings of liability and more severe remedies being ordered against Polish banks (including Bank BPH) to continue in future reporting periods, although Bank BPH is unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses associated with active and inactive Bank BPH mortgage loans beyond the amounts currently recorded. Additional factors may also affect our estimated losses over time, including: potentially significant judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court; the impact of any of these or other future or recent decisions or resolutions (including the ECJ decision in April 2021 on a case involving a Bank BPH mortgage loan, and the Polish Supreme Court binding resolution delivered verbally in May 2021 with written reasoning issued in July 2021) on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases and how borrower behavior may change in response, neither of which are known immediately upon the issuance of a decision or resolution; uncertainty related to a proposal by the Chairman of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority in December 2020 that banks voluntarily offer borrowers an opportunity to convert their foreign currency denominated mortgage loans to Polish zlotys using an exchange rate applicable at the date of loan origination, and about the various settlement strategies or other approaches that Polish banks have adopted or will adopt, or that Bank BPH may adopt in the future, in response to this proposal or other factors, and the approaches that regulators and other government authorities will adopt in response; and uncertainty arising from investigations of the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK), including existing or anticipated UOKiK decisions resulting from those investigations. Future adverse developments related to any of the foregoing, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators or other governmental authorities, likely would have a material adverse effect on Bank BPH and the carrying value of its mortgage loan portfolio as well as result in additional required capital contributions to Bank BPH or significant losses beyond the amounts that we currently estimate.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS . Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup described below, and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims were $2,660 million and $2,569 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAs previously reported, in 2000, GE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into a consent decree relating to PCB cleanup of the Housatonic River in Massachusetts. Following the EPA's release in September 2015 of an intended final remediation decision, GE and the EPA engaged in mediation and the first step of the dispute resolution process contemplated by the consent decree. In October 2016, the EPA issued its final decision pursuant to the consent decree, which GE and several other interested parties appealed to the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board (EAB). The EAB issued its decision in January 2018, affirming parts of the EPA's decision and granting relief to GE on certain significant elements of its challenge. The EAB remanded the decision back to the EPA to address those elements and reissue a revised final remedy, and the EPA convened a mediation process with GE and interested stakeholders. In February 2020, the EPA announced an agreement between the EPA and many of the mediation stakeholders, including GE, concerning a revised Housatonic River remedy. Based on the mediated resolution, the EPA solicited public comment on a draft permit and issued the final revised permit effective in January 2021. In March 2021, two local environmental advocacy groups filed a joint petition to the EAB challenging portions of the revised permit, and EPA and GE are defending that appeal. As of December 31, 2021, and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances and its defenses, GE believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with the proposed final remedy.\n\nExpenditures for site remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $193 million, $180 million and $236 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately $350 million and $250 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 23. OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nBASIS FOR PRESENTATION.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, 3M consistently included Structural Adhesives within its Safety and Industrial segment, but the contextual bundling and adjacency to other product lines shifted. In 2022, Structural Adhesives were listed alongside industrial abrasives, autobody repair solutions, and respiratory protection, suggesting a broad industrial toolkit. In 2023, the positioning remained largely similar, but with a slight emphasis on integration with electrical materials and OEM solutions. By 2024, Structural Adhesives were grouped more closely with industrial specialty products such as personal hygiene, masking, and packaging materials, indicating a potential shift toward more specialized or hybrid applications.

      "question": "How did the legal exposure and settlement activity related to Scotchgard's environmental impact evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of case resolutions, new litigation, and geographic expansion of claims?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, 3M's legal exposure related to Scotchgard's environmental impact showed a pattern of ongoing litigation with evolving geographic expansion and mixed settlement activity. In 2022, 3M settled a putative class action in New York under the Baker agreement, contributing part of a $65 million total settlement. By 2023, 3M finalized a non-material settlement in a Michigan case involving Wolverine's disposal of Scotchgard, while also facing a growing number of AFFF-related suits, with approximately 68 cases pending outside the MDL as of December 2023. In 2024, litigation expanded significantly into new states like Alabama and Georgia, with multiple new cases filed by municipal utilities, individual landowners, and carpet manufacturers, including a notable $65 million PWS Settlement framework and ongoing trials scheduled for 2026. Despite some dismissals and settlements, the geographic and legal complexity of Scotchgard-related litigation increased over the three-year period.",

          "chunk_text": "MDL. In November 2021, the defendants filed an omnibus motion regarding their government contractor defense. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a response.\n\nIn June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed eight AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. Two of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. Five cases remain pending in state courts where they are in early stages of litigation, after Valero dismissed its Ohio state court action without prejudice in October 2019. The parties in the state court cases have agreed to stay all five cases until March 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company is aware of 15 other AFFF suits originally filed in various state courts in which the Company has been named a defendant. Seven of these cases have been removed to federal court, where defendants have sought transfer to the AFFF MDL.\n\nTwo subsidiaries of Husky Energy filed suit in April 2020 against 3M and other AFFF manufacturers in Wisconsin state court relating to alleged PFAS contamination from AFFF use at Husky facilities in Superior, Wisconsin and Lima, Ohio. The parties have entered into a tolling agreement deferring further action on the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs filed a notice of dismissal without prejudice in September 2020.\n\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of firefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial amount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\n\n## Other PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M's customers' improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a AlliedSignal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc., Georgia-Pacific LLC, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., Chemours Co., and various carpet manufacturers.\n\nIn New York, 3M is defending 40 individual cases and one putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and four additional individual cases filed in New York state court against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (Saint-Gobain), Honeywell International Inc. and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. (DuPont). Tonaga, Inc. (Taconic) is also a defendant in the state court actions. Plaintiffs allege that PFOA discharged from fabric coating facilities operated by non3M entities (that allegedly had used PFOA-containing materials from 3M, among others) contaminated the drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, the Town of Hoosick and Petersburg, New York. They assert various tort claims for personal injury and property damage and in some cases request medical monitoring. 3M has answered the complaints in these individual cases, which are now proceeding through discovery. In the federal court individual cases, the parties selected 24 claimants in May 2021 for a pool from which eight plaintiffs will be chosen for expert discovery and dispositive motions. At the conclusion of these motions, the court will determine which case(s) will continue toward trial. In the putative class action, certain parties, including 3M, reached an agreement to resolve litigation among the settling parties. In February 2022, the district court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement. Under the agreement, 3M, Saint-Gobain and Honeywell will collectively contribute to a fixed total amount of approximately $65 million to resolve the plaintiffs' claims and those of the proposed classes. 3M's contribution is not considered material. 3M is also defending 13 cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York filed by various drinking water providers. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that products manufactured by 3M, DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants contaminated plaintiffs' water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. DuPont's motion to transfer these cases to the AFFF MDL was denied in March 2020. 3M has filed answers in these cases and discovery is ongoing.\n\nIn Michigan, one consolidated putative class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine World Wide (Wolverine). The action arises from Wolverine's allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to Wolverine's shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M's product contaminated the",

Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M's customers' improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater, surface water, or biosolids that were then land-applied. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including, but not limited to, DuPont, Chemours, and various carpet, paper, and textile manufacturers.\n\nThe cases brought on behalf of drinking water providers described below will be covered by the PWS Settlement if the water providers did not opt out of the PWS Settlement.\n\nIn Alabama, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending several state court cases brought by municipal water utilities. The plaintiffs in one of these cases (Shelby/Talladega Counties) are water utilities alleging that carpet manufacturers in Georgia improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River in Alabama. The case has a trial date in February 2026. In the second action, 3M is defending a putative class action by the Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the EPA. A trial date in the case has been set in June 2026. In the third case, the city of Albertville, Alabama filed suit for alleged contamination of the Tennessee River (upstream of 3M's Decatur facility) by a carpet manufacturer located upriver in Alabama. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss in May 2024, which is still pending. In the fourth case, the city of Mobile alleges that 3M and other defendants are responsible for PFAS contamination of the city's water supply resulting from PFAS released by a local landfill. In October 2024, the Court granted 3M's and several other defendants' motions to dismiss and in November 2024, 3M's co-defendants filed a motion asking the Court to certify the dismissal order as a final judgment. In the fifth case, the Town of Pine Hill, Alabama filed suit alleging that PFAS discharges from paper mills currently owned by International Paper have contaminated its water supply. 3M removed the case to federal court, and moved to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL. Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand the case to state court and an opposition to transfer. In the six th case, the City of Irondale, Alabama filed suit alleging PFAS contamination of its water supply due to industrial discharges from several users of PFAS in different industries, including alleged customers of 3M. 3M removed the case to federal court and moved to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL. Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand the case to state court and an opposition to transfer.\n\n3M is also defending a mass action filed in Alabama in June 2024 by hundreds of individual customers of the Water Works and Sewer Board for the City of Gadsden, Alabama, alleging emotional distress and property damage related to PFAS contamination of their drinking water. 3M removed the case to federal court.\n\nIn Georgia, 3M, together with co-defendants, is also defending a putative class action in federal court, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual ratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. The case is in discovery and no trial date has been set.\n\nAnother case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. Class certification has been fully briefed, and the plaintiff's injunctive relief claims were recently dismissed. Plaintiff's claims for economic damages related to alleged increases in their water rates due to the presence of PFAS remain pending.\n\nIn February 2024, two landowners in Gordon County, Georgia sued 3M and other defendants for alleged contamination of their properties from wastewater treatment sludge allegedly containing PFAS from nearby carpet manufacturing operations. One of 3M's co-defendant's, the City of Calhoun, Georgia, has filed a cross claim against 3M and other defendants alleging that biosolids from its wastewater treatment plant were contaminated with PFAS that has migrated into its water supply. In June 2024, a related lawsuit was filed on behalf of other property owners receiving biosolids from the same municipal water treatment plant. Motions to dismiss have been denied, and these claims are in active discovery. In July 2024, the City of Lyerly sued 3M and other defendants, alleging that discharges from local carpet mills contaminated the City's water supply. 3M has moved to dismiss those claims and oral argument on that motion took place on January 16, 2025.\n\nIn November 2024, Mohawk Industries, a carpet manufacturer, filed a lawsuit in Whitfield County, Georgia against 3M, DuPont, and Daikin alleging various counts of tort and contract liability, including fraud, related to sales of fluorochemicals.\n\nIn December 2024, Dalton Utilities, located in Dalton, Georgia, filed a suit against 3M, DuPont, Dakin, and several carpet manufacturers seeking clean-up costs under CERCLA for alleged PFAS contamination related to the Dalton Land Application System, which is a field that has received carpet mill effluent pursuant to a Georgia Environmental Protection Division permit since the late 1980s.",

      "question": "How did the positioning and associated product ecosystem around MMM's Reflective Signage offering evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of adjacent technologies and market applications listed alongside it in the Transportation and Electronics segment?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MMM's Reflective Signage remained a consistent offering within the Transportation and Electronics segment, but its surrounding product ecosystem expanded significantly. In 2022, it was listed alongside light management films, electronics assembly solutions, and packaging and interconnection solutions. By 2023, the ecosystem grew to include semiconductor production materials and solutions for data centers, indicating a strategic alignment with high-tech infrastructure. In 2024, the positioning remained similar to 2023, reinforcing MMM's integration of Reflective Signage into broader transportation safety and electronics value chains. This evolution suggests a deliberate effort to position Reflective Signage as part of a more technologically advanced and diversified product suite.",

In 2023, the same category was reiterated with no structural changes, maintaining its position among core industrial safety offerings. By 2024, while the phrase 'fall protection solutions' remained, it was embedded within a slightly rephrased list that emphasized 'safety products' more broadly, suggesting a potential shift toward integrated safety systems. The consistent presence of fall protection in all three years indicates sustained relevance, while the subtle rewording and contextual placement may signal evolving strategic emphasis on comprehensive safety solutions.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, 3M's electrical products portfolio remained a core part of the Safety and Industrial segment, but the specificity and framing of its offerings evolved. In 2022, the company described 'Electrical products and materials for construction and maintenance, power distribution and electrical OEMs.' In 2023, this was refined to 'Electrical products and materials for construction and maintenance, power distribution and electrical original equipment manufacturers (OEMs),' with the addition of the acronym clarification suggesting deeper integration with named partners. By 2024, the description remained largely consistent but was formatted to emphasize technical applications, using phrases like 'power distribution and electrical original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)' with tighter formatting that may reflect a more embedded or specialized product line. This progression suggests a trend toward increasing technical specificity and OEM integration over the three-year period.",

        "Hop 1: [MMM](2022) \u2192 Electrical Products: Described as 'Electrical products and materials for construction and maintenance, power distribution and electrical OEMs' in the Safety and Industrial segment.",

        "Hop 3: [MMM](2024) \u2192 Electrical Products: Maintains the 2023 phrasing but presents it with tighter formatting ('power distribution andelectrical original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)') suggesting a more integrated or specialized offering."

      "question": "How did UNP's pension plan allocation to Collective Trust and Other Funds change from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's evolving investment strategy for long-term employee benefits?",
      "answer": "UNP's allocation to Collective Trust and Other Funds decreased from $756 million in 2022 to $382 million in 2023, and then in 2024, while no updated dollar value is provided, the company emphasized the use of NAV-based valuation for these funds, indicating a strategic focus on transparency and accurate reporting despite the reduced allocation. This represents a significant downward trend in direct exposure to these funds over the three-year period, suggesting a de-risking or rebalancing of the pension portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: [UNP](2022) \u2192 [Collective Trust and Other Funds]: $756 million allocation within plan assets at NAV",

T he following is a description of the v aluation methodologies used for the inv estments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the v aluation hierarchy.\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Gov ernment Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the  U.S.  T reasury  or  by  gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises.  T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using NAV for each inv estment.",

      "question": "How has Union Pacific's engagement with FRA regulations related to tank car design improvements for hazardous materials safety evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression indicate about the company's strategic focus on regulatory compliance and risk mitigation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Union Pacific was actively collaborating with the FRA and other stakeholders to develop additional improvements to tank car design aimed at limiting the risk of hazardous material releases. By 2023, while the company continued to be subject to FRA regulations and broader federal oversight, there was no explicit mention of progress or updates regarding tank car design improvements, indicating a possible plateau or internalization of efforts. In 2024, the company reiterated its collaboration with the FRA on tank car design enhancements, suggesting a sustained commitment to this initiative over the three-year period. This trajectory implies that Union Pacific has maintained a consistent focus on regulatory-driven safety improvements, even as it navigates evolving regulatory landscapes and stakeholder expectations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UNP(2022) \u2192 FRA Regulations: UNP was working with the FRA and other groups to develop additional improvements to tank car design to limit hazardous material release risk.",
        "Hop 2: UNP(2023) \u2192 FRA Regulations: UNP remained subject to FRA regulations, but no specific mention was made of tank car design improvements, suggesting a shift in disclosure focus or internal continuation of efforts.",
        "Hop 3: UNP(2024) \u2192 FRA Regulations: UNP again explicitly mentioned working with the FRA on tank car design improvements, indicating a reiteration of the 2022 initiative and a sustained long-term focus."

We were the  first  railroad  in  the  U.S.  to  be  named  a  partner  in  CBP's  Customs-Trade  Partnership  Against  Terrorism,  a partnership designed to develop, enhance, and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain.\n\nCooperation with Customers and Trade Associations - Through TransCAER (Transportation Community Awareness and  Emergency  Response),  we  work  with  the  AAR,  the  American  Chemistry  Council,  the  American  Petroleum Institute, and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools, including the training of emergency responders. In cooperation with the FRA and other interested groups, we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials.\n\nSustainable  Future -  Union  Pacific  believes  it  is  important  that  we  act  as  environmental  stewards,  reducing emissions  and  supporting  the  transition  to  a  more  sustainable  future.  While  we  work  to  further  reduce  our environmental  footprint,  it  is  important  to  note  that  railroads  already  are  one  of  the  most  fuel-efficient  means  of transportation. According  to  the Association  of American  Railroads  (AAR),  moving  freight  by  rail  instead  of  truck reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 75%. Building on rail's relative emissions benefits over other modes of transportation, we are taking additional actions to reduce our emissions. These actions are described in our initial Climate Action Plan, which we released in December 2021.\n\nCompetition -  see  ' We Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers '  in  the  Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\n\nKey Suppliers - see ' We Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail ' in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\n\nAvailable Information -  Our  Internet website is www.up.com.

We provide these reports and statements as soon as reasonably practicable after  such  material  is  electronically  filed  with,  or  furnished  to,  the  SEC.  We  also  make  available  on  our  website previously  filed  SEC  reports  and  exhibits  via  a  link  to  EDGAR  on  the  SEC's  Internet  site  at  www.sec.gov. Additionally,  our  corporate  governance  materials,  including  By-Laws,  Board  Committee  charters,  governance guidelines and policies, and codes of conduct and ethics for directors, officers, and employees are available on our website. From time to time, the corporate governance materials on our website may be updated as necessary to comply  with  rules  issued  by  the  SEC  and  the  NYSE  or  as  desirable  to  promote  the  effective  and  efficient governance of our Company.

Therefore, such information should not be considered part of this report.\n\n## GOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION\n\nGovernmental  Regulation -  Our  operations  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  federal,  state,  and  local  regulations, generally  applicable  to  all  businesses.  (See  also  the  discussion  of  certain  regulatory  proceedings  in  Legal Proceedings, Item 3.)\n\nThe operations of the Railroad are subject to the regulations of the FRA and other federal and state agencies as well as the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The STB has jurisdiction over rates charged  on  certain  regulated  rail  traffic;  common  carrier  service  of  regulated  traffic;  freight  car  compensation; transfer,  extension,  or  abandonment  of  rail  lines;  and  acquisition  of  control  of  rail  common  carriers.  The  STB continues  its  efforts  to  explore  expanding  rail  regulation  and  is  reviewing  proposed  rulemaking  in  various  areas, including  reciprocal  switching,  commodity  exemptions,  and  expanding  and  easing  procedures  for  smaller  rate complaints.  The  STB  also  continues  to  explore  changes  to  the  methodology  for  determining  railroad  revenue adequacy and the possible uses of revenue adequacy in regulating railroad rates. The STB posts quarterly reports on  rate  reasonableness  cases,  maintains  a  database  on  service  complaints,  and  has  the  authority  to  initiate investigations, among other things.\n\nDOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,  and  DHS,  along  with  other  federal  agencies,  have  jurisdiction  over  certain  aspects  of  safety, movement  of  hazardous  materials  and  hazardous  waste,  emissions  requirements,  and  equipment  standards. Additionally,  various  state  and  local  agencies  have  jurisdiction  over  disposal  of  hazardous  waste  and  seek  to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.",

We also participate in the National Joint T errorism T ask Force, a multi-agency effort established by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI to combat and prev ent terrorism.\n\nWe  work  with  the  Coast  Guard,  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP),  and  the  Military  T ransport  Management  Command,  which  monitor shipments entering the UPRR rail network at U.S. border crossings and ports. We were the first railroad in the U.S. to be named a partner in CBP's Customs-Trade Partnership Against T errorism, a partnership designed to dev elop, enhance, and maintain effectiv e security processes throughout the global supply chain.\n\nCooperation w ith Customers and Trade Association s - Through TransCAER (Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response), we work with  the  AAR,  the  American  Chemistry  Council,  the  American  Petroleum  Institute,  and  other  chemical  trade  groups  to  prov ide  communities  with preparedness tools, including the training of emergency responders. In cooperation with the FRA and other interested groups, we are also working to develop additional improv ements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials.\n\nSustainable Future -  Union  Pacific believ es it is important that we act as env ironmental stewards, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and supporting the transition to a more sustainable future. While we work to further reduce our env ironmental footprint, it is important to note that railroads already are one of the most fuel-efficient means of transportation. Freight rail leads other forms of surface transportation when it comes to minimizing GHG emissions, and we expect rail will continue to play a critical role in mitigating and abating the impacts of climate change. According to the AAR, moving freight by rail instead of truck reduces GHG emissions by up to 75%. Therefore, conv erting freight transportation from truck to rail typically results in an immediate reduction in our customers' scope 3 GHG emissions.\n\nCompetition - see ' We Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers ' in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\n\nKey Suppliers - see ' We Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail ' in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\n\nAvailable Information - Our Internet website is www .up.com.

(See also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3.)\n\nThe operations of the Railroad are subject to the regulations of the FRA and other federal and state agencies as well as the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The STB has jurisdiction ov er rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic; common carrier serv ice of regulated traffic; freight car compensation; transfer, extension, or abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers. T he STB is rev iewing proposed rulemaking in v arious areas, including reciprocal switching and commodity exemptions, and has finalized rules creating new procedures for smaller rate complaints that are being rev iewed in appellate courts.  T he  STB also continues to explore changes to the methodology for determining railroad rev enue adequacy, the possible uses of rev enue adequacy in regulating railroad rates,",

      "question": "How did UNP's allocation to Corporate Stock within its pension plan assets evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this shift suggest about the company's investment strategy in equities over this period?",
      "answer": "UNP's allocation to Corporate Stock within its pension plan assets significantly declined from $1,990 million in 2022 to $181 million in 2023, and by 2024, the company had reclassified its common stock holdings as Level 1 investments while maintaining a smaller, more structured equity exposure through preferred shares classified as Level 2. This represents a dramatic reduction in equity exposure and a strategic shift toward more transparent and observable valuation methodologies for remaining stock investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [UNP](2022) \u2192 [Corporate Stock]: Corporate stock allocation was $1,990 million, with $1,980 million classified under Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets) and $10 million under Level 2 (significant other observable inputs).",
        "Hop 2: [UNP](2023) \u2192 [Corporate Stock]: Allocation dropped to $181 million, with $176 million in Level 1 and $5 million in Level 2, indicating a 91% reduction in equity exposure compared to 2022.",
        "Hop 3: [UNP](2024) \u2192 [Corporate Stock]: Corporate stock was reclassified into two components\u2014common stock as Level 1 and preferred stock as Level 2\u2014indicating a more segmented and methodologically transparent approach to equity investments."

T he following is a description of the v aluation methodologies used for the inv estments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the v aluation hierarchy.\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Gov ernment Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the  U.S.  T reasury  or  by  gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises.  T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using NAV for each inv estment.",

      "question": "How did Union Pacific's ownership and aging profile of Multiple Purpose Locomotives evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's fleet management and modernization strategy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Union Pacific's owned Multiple Purpose Locomotives decreased slightly from 6,204 to 5,973 units, while leased units dropped more significantly from 1,038 to 920. Over the same period, the average age of the Multiple Purpose Locomotive fleet increased from 22.5 years to 25.2 years, indicating a continued reliance on older assets despite reductions in leased equipment. This suggests a fleet management strategy that prioritizes cost control over aggressive modernization, as the company reduced leasing but did not substantially increase new purchases to offset aging.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses increased $767 million in 2021 compared to  2020  driven  by  higher  fuel  prices,  volume-related  costs, inflation,  higher  casualty  costs,  2020  management  actions, weather and wildfire-related expenses, incentive compensation,  and  higher  state  and  local  taxes.  Partially offsetting  these  increases  compared  to  2020  include  a  $278 million  impairment  charge  in  2020,  productivity  initiatives,  a one-time  bonus  payment  for  agreement  employees  in  2020, and lower severance costs. Full year results of 2021 and 2020 both include a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n2021 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits -  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension  costs,  and  incentive  costs.  In  2021,  expenses  increased  4%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  volume  related costs,  inflation,  2020  management  actions  responding  to  the  sharp  decline  in  volume  (temporary  unpaid  leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\n\nDepreciation -  The  majority  of  depreciation  relates  to  road  property,  including  rail,  ties,  ballast,  and  other  track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nFuel -  Fuel  includes  locomotive  fuel  and  gasoline  for  highway  and  non-highway  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared  to  $1.50  per  gallon  in  2020,  increased  expenses  $668  million  (excluding  any  impact  from  increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased  from  outside  contractors  and  other  service  providers  (including  equipment  maintenance  and  contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad's lines, structures, and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile  maintenance  expenses;  and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  services  and  materials  increased  3%  in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with  our  intermodal  business,  higher  costs  due  to  weather  and  wildfire-related  events,  increased  locomotive  and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\n\nEquipment  and  Other  Rents -  Equipment  and  other  rents  expense  primarily  includes  rental  expense  that  the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;  and  office  and  other  rent  expenses,  offset  by  equity  income  from  certain  equity  method  investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and  higher  equity  income  from  our  investment  in  TTX  Company,  partially  offset  by  increased  freight  car  rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\n\nOther - Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal  injury,  environmental,  employee  travel,  telephone  and  cellular,  computer  software,  bad  debt,  and  other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million noncash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital  projects,  2020  lease  impairments,  and  higher  equity  income.  Partially  offsetting  these  decreases  were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local  taxes.  Both  periods  in  2021  and  2020  included  a  reduction  of  expense  for  weather  and  wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

      "question": "How did GE's collaboration with primary insurers on long-term care premium rate increases evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression reveal about the frequency and impact of rate increase filings by ceding companies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, GE's collaboration with primary insurers on long-term care premium rate increases remained a key mechanism for managing reserve risk, though the frequency and impact of filings varied. In 2022, GE noted that the number of rate increases varied by ceding company and that they collaborated based on reinsurance contractual terms. In 2023, GE reiterated this dynamic and emphasized the importance of ceding company filings, noting that a significant portion of term policies were expected to lapse by 2024 and 2034. By 2024, GE reported a favorable $196 million pre-tax adjustment in 2024 compared to a $(155) million unfavorable adjustment in 2023, indicating that recent rate increase filings had a more positive impact on reserves. This suggests that ceding companies became more active or successful in securing premium rate increases over time, improving GE's reinsurance position.",

          "chunk_text": "Rate of Change in Morbidity . Our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim cost curves. These estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. This exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development. With respect to industry developments, we take into account that there are differences between and among industry peers in portfolio characteristics (such as demographic features of the insured populations), the aggregate effect of morbidity improvement or deterioration as applied to base claim cost projections, the extent to which such base cost projections reflect the most current experience, and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment. We assess the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projections, reconstructed in 2017. Projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have a material impact on our future claim cost projections, both on a stand-alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variables such as discount rate and premium rate increases.\n\nMortality . Mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. For life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments.\n\nDiscount rate . Interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. In estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. Lower future investment yields result in a lower discount rate and a higher present value of future policy benefit reserves.\n\nFuture long-term care premium rate increases . Long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. As a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. While we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. The amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. We consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations. Higher future premium rate increases lower the present value of future policy benefit reserves and lower future premium rate increases increase the present value of future policy benefit reserves.\n\nTerminations . Terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. Termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment. Lower termination rates increase, while higher termination rates decrease, the present value of expected future benefit payments.\n\nIn 2017, based on elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts, we initiated a comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumptions across all insurance products, resulting in a reconstruction of our future claim cost projections for long-term care insurance products. While our long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. However, the extent of actual experience since 2017 to date is limited in the context of a long-tailed, multi-decade portfolio.\n\n2021 Premium Deficiency Testing . We completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2021. These procedures included updating experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2020, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Our 2021 premium deficiency testing started with the positive margin of less than 2% of the recorded future policy benefit reserves that resulted from our 2020 premium deficiency testing. Using updated assumptions, the 2021 premium deficiency testing results indicated a significant increase in the positive margin to approximately 11% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2021. As a result, the assumptions updated in connection with the premium deficiency recognized in 2019 remain locked-in and will remain so unless another premium deficiency occurs in the future.",

M orbidity  assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care insurance exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utiliz ation (amount of av ailable benefits ex pected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last, including claim terminations due to death or recovery).\n\nRate of Change in M orbidity . Our review incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim incidence rates. These estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. This exercise of actuarial judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual review, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base assumptions, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and healthcare technology development.\n\nTerminations . Terminations include active life mortality and lapse. M ortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. Lapse refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to non-payment of premiums by a policyholder. Lapse rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment.\n\nFuture long-term care premium rate increases .

The following table provides sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves using the locked-in discount rate assumption and have been estimated across the entire product line rather than at an individual cohort level. A s our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves. M any of our assumptions, which are based on our credible experience, are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below. In addition, the effects of changes to cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves may be partially or wholly reflected in the period in which the assumptions are changed and/or over future periods and may vary across cohorts.\n\n",

      "question": "How did GE's relationship with Electric Insurance Company evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its strategic positioning, valuation, and ultimate disposition, and what financial impact did this progression have on GE across the three-year period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE disclosed that Electric Insurance Company (EIC) was a captive industrial insurance subsidiary primarily serving GE and its employees, with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion at year-end. By 2023, GE had classified EIC as held for sale, with assets of $541 million and liabilities of $378 million as of December 31, 2023, and recorded a $109 million loss related to the expected sale. In 2024, GE completed the sale of EIC to Riverstone International Holdings Inc. for $120 million in cash. This progression shows a strategic exit from a non-core business, with a significant loss recognized in 2023 and final monetization in 2024, indicating a shift in GE's portfolio toward more focused industrial operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE highlighted trailing legal liabilities from disposed or inactive businesses, including legacy matters from the Alstom acquisition and shareholder lawsuits related to past financial reporting. By 2023, the company remained subject to material contingent liabilities from exited businesses and ongoing legacy legal proceedings, including shareholder lawsuits tied to financial performance and disclosure practices. In 2024, GE continued to face significant trailing legal liabilities, with an emphasis on reputational risks from legacy matters and uncertainties in growth markets with less developed legal systems.

          "chunk_text": "required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant reduction or increase to equity. The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to changes in key economic indicators, and future decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans under ERISA. Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors, which could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility, could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans. In addition, there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current and future retirees. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to control increases in these costs will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligations, see Note 12.\n\nLEGAL &amp; COMPLIANCE RISKS. Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment, legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including matters relating to financial reporting and the environment, health and safety. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to make adverse changes to our business models or practices.\n\nRegulatory - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways. Our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. In particular, recent trends globally toward increased protectionism, import and export controls and the use of tariffs and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our businesses that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, anti-corruption, competition law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, states or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws, could increase our costs or tax rate. In addition, efforts by public and private sectors to control healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements and increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. Inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status with such customers or our ability to participate in projects, and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to do bid for business with certain government-related customers or to participate in projects involving multilateral development banks, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nLegal proceedings - We are subject to legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including trailing liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives, and the industries in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union, China and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and/or damages that could be material. For example, following our acquisition of Alstom's Thermal, Renewables and Grid businesses in 2015, we are subject to legacy legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or corruption by Alstom in the pre-acquisition period, and payments for settlements, judgments, penalties or other liabilities in connection with those matters have resulted and will in the future result in cash outflows. In addition, while in December 2020 we entered into a settlement to conclude the previously disclosed SEC investigation of GE, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters. We have observed that these proceedings related to claims about past financial performance and reporting pose particular reputational risks for the Company that can cause new allegations about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, to have a more significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others than they otherwise would. We have established reserves for legal matters when and as appropriate; however, the estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly in light of the global and diverse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving GE employees or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. Moreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law,",

M oreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in those markets.

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, GE's exposure to Bank BPH's mortgage litigation significantly increased, with estimated losses rising from $1,359 million in 2022 to $2,669 million in 2023, before slightly declining to $2,461 million in 2024. Capital contributions shifted from cash to non-cash mechanisms, with GE contributing $530 million in cash in 2022 and transitioning to a $1,797 million non-cash intercompany loan forgiveness in 2023, with no further contributions required in 2024. The litigation's impact on earnings also fluctuated, with pre-tax charges of $720 million in 2022, spiking to $1,189 million in 2023, and dropping to zero in 2024, indicating a stabilization of the issue by the end of the period.",

          "chunk_text": "We estimate potential losses for Bank BPH in connection with borrower litigation cases that are pending by recording legal reserves, as well as in connection with potential future cases or other adverse developments as part of our ongoing valuation of the Bank BPH portfolio, which we record at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. The total amount of such estimated losses was $755 million and $315 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We update our assumptions underlying the amount of estimated losses based primarily on the number of lawsuits filed and estimated to be filed in the future, whether liability will be established in lawsuits and the nature of the remedy ordered by courts if liability is established. The increase in the amount of estimated losses during 2021 was driven primarily by increases in the number of lawsuits estimated to be filed in the future and increased findings of liability. We expect the trends we have previously reported of an increasing number of lawsuits being filed, more findings of liability and more severe remedies being ordered against Polish banks (including Bank BPH) to continue in future reporting periods, although Bank BPH is unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses associated with active and inactive Bank BPH mortgage loans beyond the amounts currently recorded. Additional factors may also affect our estimated losses over time, including: potentially significant judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court; the impact of any of these or other future or recent decisions or resolutions (including the ECJ decision in April 2021 on a case involving a Bank BPH mortgage loan, and the Polish Supreme Court binding resolution delivered verbally in May 2021 with written reasoning issued in July 2021) on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases and how borrower behavior may change in response, neither of which are known immediately upon the issuance of a decision or resolution; uncertainty related to a proposal by the Chairman of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority in December 2020 that banks voluntarily offer borrowers an opportunity to convert their foreign currency denominated mortgage loans to Polish zlotys using an exchange rate applicable at the date of loan origination, and about the various settlement strategies or other approaches that Polish banks have adopted or will adopt, or that Bank BPH may adopt in the future, in response to this proposal or other factors, and the approaches that regulators and other government authorities will adopt in response; and uncertainty arising from investigations of the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK), including existing or anticipated UOKiK decisions resulting from those investigations. Future adverse developments related to any of the foregoing, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators or other governmental authorities, likely would have a material adverse effect on Bank BPH and the carrying value of its mortgage loan portfolio as well as result in additional required capital contributions to Bank BPH or significant losses beyond the amounts that we currently estimate.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS . Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup described below, and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims were $2,660 million and $2,569 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAs previously reported, in 2000, GE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into a consent decree relating to PCB cleanup of the Housatonic River in Massachusetts. Following the EPA's release in September 2015 of an intended final remediation decision, GE and the EPA engaged in mediation and the first step of the dispute resolution process contemplated by the consent decree. In October 2016, the EPA issued its final decision pursuant to the consent decree, which GE and several other interested parties appealed to the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board (EAB). The EAB issued its decision in January 2018, affirming parts of the EPA's decision and granting relief to GE on certain significant elements of its challenge. The EAB remanded the decision back to the EPA to address those elements and reissue a revised final remedy, and the EPA convened a mediation process with GE and interested stakeholders. In February 2020, the EPA announced an agreement between the EPA and many of the mediation stakeholders, including GE, concerning a revised Housatonic River remedy. Based on the mediated resolution, the EPA solicited public comment on a draft permit and issued the final revised permit effective in January 2021. In March 2021, two local environmental advocacy groups filed a joint petition to the EAB challenging portions of the revised permit, and EPA and GE are defending that appeal. As of December 31, 2021, and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances and its defenses, GE believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with the proposed final remedy.\n\nExpenditures for site remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $193 million, $180 million and $236 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately $350 million and $250 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 23. OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nBASIS FOR PRESENTATION.

Results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis.\n\nGE Vernova. On April 2, 2024, we completed the previously announced separation of GE V ernova. The separation was structured as a tax-free spin-off and was achieved through the Company's pro-rata distribution of all the outstanding shares of GE V ernova to holders of the Company's common stock. In connection with the GE Vernova separation, the historical results of GE V ernova and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in GE A erospace consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. In addition, the Company contributed $515 million of cash to fund GE V ernova's future operations such that GE Vernova's cash balance on the date of separation was $4,242 million.\n\nWe have continuing involvement with GE Vernova primarily through ongoing sales of products, a transition services agreement, through which GE A erospace and GE Vernova continue to provide certain services to each other for a period of time following the separation, a separation and distribution agreement, including performance and financial guarantees, a tax matters agreement and a trademark licensing agreement. For the nine months (post separation) ended December 31, 2024, we had direct and indirect sales of $248 million to GE V ernova, primarily related to engine sales and parts. We collected net cash of $943 million related to the transition services agreement and sales of engines and parts in 2024.\n\nGE HealthCare. On January 3, 2023, we completed the previously announced separation of our HealthCare business, into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare). The separation was structured as a tax-free spin-off and was achieved through the Company's pro-rata distribution of approximately 80.1% of the outstanding shares of GE HealthCare to holders of the Company's common stock. In connection with the separation, the historical results of GE HealthCare and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in GE A erospace consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\n\nWe have continuing involvement with GE HealthCare primarily through a transition services agreement, through which GE A erospace and GE HealthCare continue to provide certain services to each other for a period of time following the separation, a tax matters agreement and a trademark licensing agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we collected net cash of $230 million related to these activities. A s of December 31, 2024, the transition services agreement was completed.\n\nBank BPH . A s prev iously  reported, Bank BPH, along with other Polish banks, has been subject to ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of floating rate residential mortgage loans, with cases brought by individual borrowers seeking relief related to their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans in various courts throughout Poland. A s previously reported, a settlement program was adopted and we recorded a charge of $1,014 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH was $2,461 million and $2,669 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In order to maintain appropriate regulatory capital levels, in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we made the previously reported non-cash capital contributions in the form of intercompany loan forgiveness of $1,797 million; no incremental contributions from GE A erospace were required in 2024. For further information about factors that are relevant to the estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH, see Note 24. Future changes or adverse developments could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH.\n\nThe Bank BPH financing receivable portfolio is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, which reflects market yields and estimates with respect to ongoing borrower litigation. A t December 31, 2024, the total portfolio had no carrying value, net of a valuation allowance. Earnings (loss) related to ongoing borrower litigation included zero, $1,189 million and $720 million in pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n48 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell's Safety and Productivity Solutions division faced adverse industry economic conditions due to reduced investments in process automation and plant capacity utilization, fluctuating retail markets, and product commoditization. In 2023, the risk was reiterated under the broader context of international economic and geopolitical instability, including trade restrictions and foreign exchange volatility, which impacted global operations. By 2024, the exposure shifted to the Energy and Sustainability Solutions division, where downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, and semiconductor plants, along with raw material supply fluctuations and oil price volatility, continued to pose economic risks. This evolution suggests a strategic realignment toward sustainability-focused sectors while maintaining exposure to industrial automation and global macroeconomic risks.",

Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events, such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted our operating results.  Operating  results  could  also  be  impacted  by  changes  in  overall  trends  related  to  end  market  demand  for  the  product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.\n- Honeywell  Building  Technologies -Operating  results  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  downturns  in  the  level  of  global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.\n- Performance Materials and Technologies -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for  chemical,  industrial,  refining,  petrochemical,  and  semiconductor  plants,  our  customers'  availability  of  capital  for  refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand  and  supply, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe, and our ability to maximize our facilities' production capacity and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n- Safety  and  Productivity  Solutions -Operating  results  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  reduced  investments  in  process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins.\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow.\n\nThe continued global spread of COVID-19 creates significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption that have impacted our business, operations, and financial results and may continue to do so. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact  our  business,  operations  and  financial  results  will  depend  on  numerous  evolving  factors  that  we  may  not  be  able  to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, including emergence and impact of new variants; some of which have been, and may be in the future, more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain, and any continued increase in cases globally and across the United States in particular, including breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated population, as well as the timing, availability, and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines; the pace of vaccine deployment; the impact of vaccine mandates, governmental, business and individual decisions and actions; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; and the extent to which we or our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers or other business partners may be prevented  from  conducting  normal  business  activities,  including  due  to  shutdowns  or  other  restrictive  measures  that  may  be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) the purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) our liquidity and cash flow.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did the risk of new aircraft order cancellations evolve as a concern for Honeywell's Aerospace business from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the ongoing recovery and stability of the commercial aviation sector?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Honeywell consistently highlighted new aircraft order cancellations as a key risk factor for its Aerospace business, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in the commercial aviation sector. In 2022, the risk was tied directly to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including regional restrictions and public health concerns that impacted demand for air travel and led to cancellations. By 2023, the language expanded to include broader external events such as regional conflicts and environmental issues as potential triggers for cancellations, suggesting a shift from pandemic-specific concerns to more generalized macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. In 2024, the risk remained prominent, with continued emphasis on new entrants and non-traditional players affecting market demand trends, indicating that while the pandemic's direct impact had waned, structural and competitive shifts continued to pose uncertainty. This 3-year consistency shows that while the aviation sector was in recovery, it remained fragile and susceptible to both external shocks and evolving market dynamics.",

Disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\n\nEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\n\n- Aerospace Technologies -Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability , factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utiliz ation rates. O perating results may  also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for events related to public health, safety , the environment, or regional conflicts. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.\n- Industrial Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utiliz ation initiativ es, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins.\n- Building Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global buildings and infrastructure construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.\n- Energy and Sustainability Solutions -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply , product  commoditization,  continued  illegal  imports  of  hydrofluorocarbons  into  Europe,  and  our  ability  to  maximize  our  facilities'  production  capacity  and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory , foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Honeywell's disclosures show a consistent and expanding concern around changes in the competitive landscape across multiple business segments. In 2022, the company cited 'changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies' affecting Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. In 2023, this concern remained consistent, with the same language used for those segments, indicating sustained pressure. By 2024, the competitive risk was reiterated for Building Automation and Industrial Automation, with added emphasis on 'new technologies that may lead to product commoditization,' suggesting a deepening concern as new entrants and innovation threaten differentiation and pricing power. This 3-year trend indicates a persistent and potentially intensifying market pressure, where Honeywell must increasingly focus on innovation and cost competitiveness to maintain margins and market share.",

Disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\n\nEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\n\n- Aerospace Technologies -Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability , factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utiliz ation rates. O perating results may  also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for events related to public health, safety , the environment, or regional conflicts. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.\n- Industrial Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utiliz ation initiativ es, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins.\n- Building Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global buildings and infrastructure construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.\n- Energy and Sustainability Solutions -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply , product  commoditization,  continued  illegal  imports  of  hydrofluorocarbons  into  Europe,  and  our  ability  to  maximize  our  facilities'  production  capacity  and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory , foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's exposure to fluctuations in retail markets impact its Safety and Productivity Solutions segment in 2022, Industrial Automation segment in 2024, and overall risk posture in 2023, and what does this evolution suggest about the company's sensitivity to retail demand volatility across its industrial portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell's Safety and Productivity Solutions segment identified 'fluctuations in retail markets' as a key risk factor that could lead to reduced investments in safety monitoring and process automation, directly impacting demand for its products and services. By 2023, this risk was reiterated as part of the broader macroeconomic and industry risks, with emphasis on how global economic instability and fluctuating demand could continue to affect customer investment behavior. In 2024, the risk was specifically tied to the newly restructured Industrial Automation segment, where 'fluctuations in retail markets' were again cited as a potential cause of slowdowns in demand for safety products and could result in lower market share and reduced margins. This progression shows that Honeywell's exposure to retail market volatility remained a consistent concern across three years, even as the company reorganized its business units, suggesting a persistent sensitivity to consumer-driven demand shifts within its industrial offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nOur business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition are subject to the material risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\n\nEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\n\n- Aerospace Technologies -Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability , factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utiliz ation rates. O perating results may  also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for events related to public health, safety , the environment, or regional conflicts. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.\n- Industrial Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utiliz ation initiativ es, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins.\n- Building Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global buildings and infrastructure construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.\n- Energy and Sustainability Solutions -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply , product  commoditization,  continued  illegal  imports  of  hydrofluorocarbons  into  Europe,  and  our  ability  to  maximize  our  facilities'  production  capacity  and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory , foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did UPS's financial obligations and disclosures regarding the 7.620% Debentures evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression indicate about the company's long-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS maintained consistent disclosure about the $276 million 7.620% Debentures maturing in 2030, but the company's treatment of interest payments and redemption flexibility evolved. In 2022, UPS emphasized the variable interest rate history and redemption mechanics. By 2024, the focus shifted to the semi-annual interest payment structure and the absence of sinking fund requirements, indicating a stable long-term liability. In 2023, the debentures were reported at $280 million, showing a slight increase in carrying value, suggesting possible amortization adjustments or market valuation changes. This trajectory reveals UPS's strategy of maintaining long-term fixed-rate obligations with controlled redemption exposure.",

These debentures had an interest rate of 8.375% until April 1, 2020, at which time the interest rate decreased to 7.620% for the remaining term. These debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time. The redemption price is equal to the greater of the principal amount plus accrued interest, or the present value of remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points, plus accrued interest. Interest is payable semi-annually in April and October, and the debentures are not subject to sinking fund requirements.\n\n## Floating-Rate Senior Notes\n\nOur floating-rate senior notes bear interest at rates that reference the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") for U.S. Dollars. As part of a broader program of reference rate reform, it is expected that U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates will cease to be published after June 2023.\n\nWe have floating-rate senior notes in the principal amounts of $400 and $500 million that bear interest at three-month LIBOR, plus a spread of 38 and 45 basis points, respectively. These notes are not callable. The $400 million notes mature in 2022 and the $500 million notes mature in 2023, prior to the expected discontinuance of U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The average interest rate for 2021 and 2020, including interest on the $350 million floating-rate senior notes that matured on April 1, 2021, was 0.58% and 1.29%, respectively.\n\nThe remaining floating-rate senior notes, with principal amounts totaling $1.0 billion, bear interest at either one or threemonth LIBOR, less a spread ranging from 30 to 45 basis points. These notes have maturities ranging from 2049 through 2067 and will be impacted by the discontinuance of U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates in June 2023. We are currently working to transition these notes to an alternative reference rate. We anticipate that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") will be adopted in accordance with recommendations of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee.\n\nThe average interest rate on the remaining floating-rate senior notes for 2021 and 2020 was 0.00% and 0.40%, respectively. These notes are callable at various times after 30 years at a stated percentage of par value, and redeemable at the option of the note holders at various times after one year at a stated percentage of par value. We have classified these floating-rate senior notes as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, due to our intent and ability to refinance the debt if the put option is exercised.",

In 2024, the daily ground package volume remained at around 16 million, but with a strategic shift as UPS announced the insourcing of UPS SurePost starting January 1, 2025, to gain more control over service quality. This trend indicates a slight decline in volume between 2022 and 2023, followed by stabilization, while the decision to insource SurePost highlights UPS's strategic focus on enhancing control and service reliability for non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, UPS maintained the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan as a noncontributory plan covering employees previously in the Central States Pension Fund and others under collective bargaining agreements. In 2022, there were no direct changes to the plan, but UPS amended Canadian pension plans to cease future accruals by 2023, resulting in a $34 million curtailment gain. In 2023, UPS's Teamsters employees ratified a new five-year agreement that included wage and benefit increases impacting the UPS Pension Plan and the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan, with those changes factored into the year-end pension measurements. In 2024, the structure of the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan remained unchanged from prior years, continuing to provide benefits based on service credits. The evolution shows UPS managing legacy pension obligations while navigating collective bargaining outcomes that directly influence benefit structures and financial reporting impacts.",

COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans which cover our employees worldwide.\n\n## U.S. Pension Benefits\n\nIn the U.S. we maintain the following single-employer defined benefit pension plans: the UPS Retirement Plan, the UPS Pension Plan, the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan, a non-qualified plan.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries hired prior to July 1, 2016 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax-qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS').\n\nThe UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan will cease accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, certain former U.S. employees were offered the option to receive a one-time payment of their vested pension benefit. Approximately 18,800 former employees accepted this option, accelerating $820 million in benefit payments during 2019 while reducing the number of participants who are due future payments from U.S. pension plans. As the cost of these settlements did not exceed the plans' service cost and interest cost for the year, the impact of the settlement was not recognized in earnings.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight as discussed in note 4. The divestiture triggered an interim remeasurement of certain UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement medical benefit plans under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715- Compensation- Retirement Benefits ('ASC 715'). Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and benefit obligations of the UPS Pension Plan, UPS Retirement Plan and UPS Retired Employee Health Care Plan as of April 30, 2021.\n\nThe interim remeasurement resulted in an actuarial gain of $2.1 billion. The actuarial gain reflects a $3.7 billion benefit from a 49 basis point increase in the discount rate compared to December 31, 2020 and a $0.1 billion benefit related to workforce reductions associated with the divestiture, offset by a $1.7 billion loss resulting from actual returns being approximately 430 basis points below expected returns. The $2.1 billion actuarial gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. A pre-tax actuarial gain of $69 million ($52 million after tax) was immediately recognized for a prior service credit related to the divested group in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter. We also amended certain benefit terms within these plans as of April 30, 2021. The amendment to the UPS Pension Plan resulted in the immediate recognition of a $66 million ($50 million after tax) loss in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter.\n\nThe impacts of the plan remeasurements and plan amendments are included within Other expenses in the statements of consolidated income as components of the divestiture of UPS Freight.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS's time-definite delivery services expanded in scope and technological sophistication. In 2022, UPS highlighted its U.S. domestic leadership with over 17 million daily ground packages and a global air hub network spanning Louisville, Germany, China, Hong Kong, Canada, and Florida. By 2023, the company emphasized its RFID-enabled Smart Package and Smart Facility technologies, which optimized network efficiency and enhanced shipment visibility across its single global logistics network serving over 200 countries. In 2024, UPS further solidified its digital infrastructure by leveraging its automated systems and contractual revenue processing for global small package operations, which accounted for 86% of its total revenue. This progression reflects a strategic shift toward integrating advanced digital tools and expanding global reach while maintaining a robust time-definite delivery portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "We offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages seven days a week. Our global network offers approximately 188,000 entry points where customers can tender packages to us at locations and times convenient to them. This includes UPS drivers who can accept packages, UPS drop boxes, UPS Access Point locations, The UPS Store locations, authorized shipping outlets and commercial counters, alliance locations and customer centers attached to UPS facilities. Our UPS Access Point network includes local small businesses and national retailers. This network allows consumers to ship or redirect packages to an alternate delivery location or to drop off pre-labeled packages, including returns. The UPS Access Point network includes more than 20,000 locations within the U.S. and 52,000 globally.\n\nWe offer a portfolio of returns services in more than 140 countries. These services are driven by the continued growth of ecommerce that has increased our customers' need for efficient and reliable returns, and are designed to promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience. This portfolio provides a range of cost-effective label and digital returns options and a broad network of consumer drop points. We also offer a selection of returns technologies, such as UPS Returns Manager, that promote systems integration, increase customer ease of use and visibility of inbound merchandise. These technologies help reduce costs and improve efficiency in our customers' reverse logistics processes.\n\nOur global air operations are based in Louisville, Kentucky, and are supported by air hubs across the United States and internationally. We operate international air hubs in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Canada and Florida (for Latin America and the Caribbean). This network design enables cost-effective package processing in our most technology-enabled facilities, which allows us to use fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nWe are a leader in time-definite, guaranteed small package delivery services in the United States. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed air and ground package transportation services. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous United States.\n\n- Our air portfolio offers time-definite, same day, next day, two day and three day delivery alternatives.\n- Our ground network enables customers to ship using our day-definite guaranteed ground service. We deliver more ground packages in the U.S. than any other carrier, with average daily package volume of more than 17 million, most within one to three business days.\n- UPS SurePost provides residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. It offers the consistency and reliability of the UPS ground network, with final delivery often provided by the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Latin America and ISMEA. International high-growth markets are one of our identified growth opportunities. We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services, including more guaranteed time-definite express options than any other carrier.\n\nFor international package shipments that do not require express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, guaranteed day-definite service option. For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada, and between the U.S. and Mexico. UPS Worldwide Express Freight is a premium international service for urgent, palletized shipments over 150 pounds.\n\nEurope is our largest region outside of the U.S. and, in 2021, accounted for nearly half of our international package segment revenue. We continue to make major European infrastructure investments to meet growing demand for our services and to improve transit times across the region. Customers can reach more than 80% of Europe's population within two business days using UPS Standard.\n\nWe serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and territories through more than two dozen alliances with local delivery companies that supplement our owned operations.\n\nThe introduction of a direct flight from the U.S. to Dubai has improved time-in-transit to key destinations in ISMEA for shippers throughout the U.S., Canada and Latin America. In India, we are investing in our network to improve transit times and extend pickup times, allowing businesses to gain faster access to markets in Europe and the United States.",

In order to estimate NAV, the Company evaluates audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, and makes adjustments, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these subjective assumptions.\n\nAuditing the estimated NAV of these hedge fund, private debt, private equity and real estate investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the completeness, reliability and relevance of the inputs used by management.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the inputs used by management to estimate the NAV of the U.S. Plans' hedge fund, private debt, private equity and real estate investments (collectively, the 'funds') included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers, the relevance of asset class benchmark returns, and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable inputs related to the underlying assets of the funds, including certain controls for which the control design was modified following the transition of the UPS Group Trust's investment management function to Goldman Sachs.\n- For a selection of investments, we evaluated certain inputs and recalculated ending values in accordance with management's processes and confirmed directly with the respective fund manager its preliminary estimate of the fund's NAV as of December 31, 2024.\n- We evaluated the Company's historical ability to accurately estimate NAV for these funds by comparing each fund's recorded valuation as of its prior fiscal year end to the NAV per the audited fund financial statements (which are received in arrears of the Company's reporting timetable).\n\n## Revenue - Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nApproximately 86 percent of the Company's revenues are from its global small package operations that provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. The Company's global small package revenues are comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions sourced from systems that were primarily developed by the Company. The processing of transactions, including the recording of them, is highly automated and based on contractual terms with the Company's customers.\n\nAuditing global small package revenue required a significant extent of effort and the involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (\"IT\") necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications, and automated controls.",

          "chunk_text": "## Competitive Strengths\n\nOur competitive strengths include:\n\nGlobal Smart Logistics Network. We believe that our integrated global air and ground network is the most extensive in the industry. We provide all types of package services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through a single pickup and delivery network. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize network efficiency and asset utilization.\n\nGlobal Presence. We serve more than 220 countries and territories. We have a significant presence in all of the world's major economies, allowing us to effectively and efficiently operate around the world.\n\nCutting-Edge Technologies. We are a global leader in developing technologies that help our customers enhance their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency. We offer a variety of online tools that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own websites, deepening our customer relationships. These tools allow customers to send, manage and track their shipments, and also to provide their customers with better information services.\n\nA Broad Portfolio of Services. Our portfolio of services helps customers choose their most appropriate delivery option. Increasingly, our customers benefit from UPS business solutions that integrate our services beyond package delivery. For example, supply chain services - such as freight forwarding, truckload brokerage, customs brokerage, order fulfillment and returns management - help improve the efficiency of our customers' entire supply chain management process.\n\nCustomer Relationships. We focus on building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. Providing value-added services beyond package delivery, and cross-selling small package and supply chain services across our customer base, are important retention tools and growth mechanisms for us.\n\nBrand Equity. We have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality, reliability and service innovation. Our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.\n\nDistinctive Culture. We believe that the dedication of our employees comes in large part from our distinctive 'employeeowner' culture. Our founders believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, and the employee stock ownership tradition dates back to our first stock ownership program in 1927. Our legacy of fairness and equity is the bedrock of our culture and of our relationships with those we serve.\n\nFinancial Strength. Our financial strength allows us to generate value for our shareowners by investing in technology, transportation equipment, facilities and employee development; pursuing strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth and maintaining a strong credit rating that gives us flexibility in running the business.\n\n## Products and Services; Reporting Segments\n\nWe have two reporting segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. U.S. Domestic Package and International Package are together referred to as our global small package operations.\n\n## Global Small Package\n\nOur global small package operations provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. These services are supported by numerous shipping, visibility and billing technologies. For example, our Digital Access Program makes it easier for SMBs to use our services by embedding our shipping solutions directly into leading e-commerce platforms.\n\nAll services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) are managed through a single, global smart logistics network. We combine all packages within our network, unless dictated by specific service commitments. This enables us to efficiently pick up customers' shipments for any services at a scheduled time each day. Our integrated network provides unique operational and capital efficiencies that have a lower environmental impact than single service network designs.",

          "chunk_text": "We offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages seven days a week through a broad variety of network access points including, UPS drop boxes, UPS Access Point locations and The UPS Store locations. UPS drivers can also directly accept packages.\n\nWe offer a portfolio of returns services in approximately 150 countries. These returns services are driven by the continued prevalence of e-commerce that has increased our customers' needs for efficient and reliable returns and are designed to promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience.\n\nOur global air operations hub is located in Louisville, Kentucky, and is supported by air hubs across the United States (\"U.S.\") and internationally. We operate international air hubs in G ermany, China, Hong Kong, Canada and Florida (for Latin America and the Caribbean). This design enables cost-effective package processing using fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nWe are a leader in time-definite, guaranteed small package delivery services in the United States. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic air and ground package transportation services. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous United States.\n\n- Our air portfolio offers time-definite, same-day, nex t-day, two-day and three-day delivery alternatives as well as air cargo services.\n- Our ground network enables customers to ship using our day-definite ground service. We deliver approximately 16 million ground packages per day, most within one to three business days.\n- UPS SurePost provides residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. Through 2024, final delivery was often provided by the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"). Beginning January 1, 2025, in order to have more control over our ability to provide our customers industry-leading service, we have insourced this product. For additional information, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa (together \"EMEA\"), Canada and Latin America (together \"Americas\") and Asia. We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services.\n\nFor international package shipments that do not require express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, day-definite service option. For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada, and between the U.S. and Mexico. Worldwide Economy offers a contract-only, e-commerce solution for non-urgent, cross-border shipments. UPS Worldwide Express Freight is a premium international service for urgent, palletized shipments over 150 pounds.\n\n## Supply Chain Solutions\n\nSupply Chain Solutions consists of our forwarding, logistics, digital and other businesses. Serving more than 200 countries and territories, we strategically seek to provide integration across increasingly complex, specialized and fragmented supply chains.\n\n## Forwarding\n\nWe are one of the largest U.S. domestic airfreight carriers and airfreight forwarders globally. We offer a portfolio of guaranteed and non-guaranteed global airfreight services. Additionally, as one of the world's leading non-vessel operating common carriers, we provide ocean freight full container load, less-than-container load and multimodal transportation services between most major ports around the world. We also provide customs brokerage as well as various related services.\n\nIn September 2024, we completed the divestiture of our truckload brokerage business (\"Coyote\"). For additional information on this divestiture, see note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Logistics\n\nOur global logistics and distribution business provides value-added fulfillment and transportation management services. We operate both multi-client and dedicated facilities across our network, many of which are strategically located near UPS air",

      "answer": "In 2022, BA's investments in Private Equity Vehicles were primarily structured through limited partnerships (LPs) focusing on U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital, growth, and special situation strategies. In 2023, the company maintained this structure and expanded its description to clarify that these investments may also be held through other fund structures, signaling a potential broadening of vehicle types. By 2024, BA continued to emphasize the same strategies but began explicitly linking investment managers' roles and derivative usage to private equity vehicles, suggesting a more integrated approach to managing these investments. This 3-year progression shows a stable core strategy with increasing operational sophistication.",

These  impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated  customer considerations.\n\nThe timing of the resumption of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon rework, ongoing customer and supplier  engagement,  production  stability  and  our  activities  with  the  FAA.  China  is  a  significant  market  for  the  787 program, and if the program is unable to obtain additional orders from China in future quarters, we may be required to further  adjust  production  rate  assumptions.  If  we  are  required  to  further  reduce  the  accounting  quantity  and/or production  rates,  experience  further  delivery  delays  or  experience  other  factors  that  result  in  lower  margins,  the program could record additional losses and higher abnormal production costs in future periods.\n\nFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane  delivery  and  continue  throughout  the  operational  life  of  the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  and  technical  data  and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\n\nProgram  Development The  following  chart  summarizes  the  time  horizon  between  go-ahead  and  planned  initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.\n\nReflects models in development during 2021\n\nThe development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements. The timing of certifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X and 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules.  These  challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance  and  reliability  standards  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program  profitability  is  subject  to significant  risks.  Factors  that  could  result  in  lower  margins  (or  a  material  charge  if  an  airplane  program  has  or  is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations.

In July 2024, we obtained approv al from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. Flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, based on flight test delays and our rev ised assessment of certification timelines, the anticipated first deliv ery of the 7779 was delayed to 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter mov ed to 2028. First deliv ery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. In addition, we decided to slow the production rate ramp of 777X  to address production challenges, which resulted in higher production costs and further customer deliv ery delays. As a result of these changes, as well as higher estimated labor and supplier costs, we recorded a $2,608 million reach-forward loss during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X  program primarily due to higher costs as a result of the new IAM 751 agreement.\n\nWe are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nThe lev el of profitability on the 777X  program will be subject to sev eral factors. T hese factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, deliv ery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X  or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n787 Program T he  accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and deliv ering airplanes. During 2024, we slowed production to below 5 per month due to supply chain constraints as well as other production issues.  While we continue to be impacted by performance challenges and supply chain constraints, we are working  to  increase  production  rates.  Delays  associated  with  business  class  seats  adv ersely  impacted  2024  deliv eries  and  will  continue  to  impact deliv eries in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 25 aircraft in inv entory that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. We expect to complete the rework and deliv er the majority of these aircraft in 2025. T he inspections and rework costs on inv entoried aircraft are accounted for as abnormal production costs, and we expensed $256 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFleet  Support We  prov ide  the  operators  of  our  commercial  aircraft  with  assistance  and  serv ices  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  airplane  operation. Collectiv ely known as fleet support serv ices, these activ ities and serv ices begin prior to airplane deliv ery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. T hey include flight and maintenance training, field serv ice support, engineering serv ices, information serv ices and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and hav e historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and serv ices.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.",

      "question": "How did BA's allocation to Special Situation Strategies evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this 3-year trend indicate about the company's private equity investment strategy?",
      "answer": "BA maintained a consistent focus on Special Situation Strategies as part of its private equity investment vehicles across 2022, 2023, and 2024. In 2022, the company described its private equity investments as primarily limited partnerships (LPs) investing in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital, growth, and special situation strategies. This characterization remained unchanged in 2023 and 2024, suggesting a stable strategic allocation to these types of opportunities. While no specific dollar amounts were disclosed for Special Situation Strategies in any year, the consistent inclusion of this category among core private equity strategies indicates that BA has preserved its exposure to these investments as part of a broader diversified private equity portfolio. The lack of quantitative disclosure limits trend analysis but confirms strategic continuity.",

BGS  sustains  aerospace platforms and systems with a full spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and conversions, spare parts, pilot and maintenance training systems and services, technical and maintenance documents, and data analytics and digital services.\n\n## Boeing Capital Segment\n\nBCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product,  while  managing  overall  financing  exposure.  BCC's  portfolio  consists  of  equipment  under  operating  leases, sales-type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and  from  third  parties.  For  example,  the  U.S.  government  has  licenses  in  our  patents  that  are  developed  in performance  of  government  contracts,  and  it  may  use  or  authorize  others  to  use  the  inventions  covered  by  such patents  for  government  purposes.  Unpatented  research,  development  and  engineering  skills,  as  well  as  certain trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and safety of our employees and maintain business continuity. As COVID-19 vaccines became available, we strongly encouraged employees to get vaccinated when eligible, followed federal and state government vaccination requirements, provided resources and support to help employees get vaccinated, offered paid time off for primary and booster vaccinations, and supported vaccination clinics for our employees and their families. We provided access to virtual  primary  care  physicians  at  no  cost.  We  expanded  our  virtual  work  options  and  many  of  our  office workers continue to telecommute. We have maintained safety protocols at our sites, including face coverings, physical distance requirements and enhanced cleaning requirements. We continue to encourage daily self-health checks and operate our coronavirus hotline, which enables employees to report exposure to COVID-19 and positive COVID-19 test results  directly  to  our  Health  Services  group.  As  part  of  that  reporting  process,  we  have  a  robust  contact  tracing program to identify those who have been in close contact in the workplace with employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. All of the actions above are overseen by Boeing's Crisis Management Working Group, a multi-functional, multi-discipline team tasked with integrating all aspects of Boeing's COVID-19 response.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Boeing's total workforce was approximately 142,000, with 12% located outside of the U.S.\n\n2",

      "answer": "In 2022, 3M listed Structural Adhesives alongside industrial abrasives, autobody repair solutions, and electrical materials, emphasizing integration with metalworking and OEM electrical markets. In 2023, the positioning remained largely consistent, grouped with similar industrial solutions but with a slightly expanded emphasis on packaging and closure systems. By 2024, Structural Adhesives were still a core part of the Safety and Industrial segment, but the surrounding product suite showed a shift toward more specialized industrial applications, such as industrial specialty products and materials for construction and maintenance. This evolution suggests a strategic reinforcement of structural adhesives as a foundational component in complex industrial systems rather than just a standalone product.",

      "question": "How did the legal exposure and litigation landscape involving 3M's production of Scotchgard evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of case settlements, geographic expansion of lawsuits, and the number of defendants involved?",
      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, 3M's legal exposure related to Scotchgard shifted significantly. In 2022, 3M, along with Saint-Gobain and Honeywell, settled a class action in New York (Baker case) for $65 million, with 3M's share considered immaterial. In 2023, 3M finalized a non-material settlement in a Michigan case involving Wolverine World Wide, where Scotchgard was linked to contamination from shoe manufacturing waste. By 2024, litigation had expanded geographically, particularly in Alabama and Georgia, with multiple new cases brought by municipal water utilities, individual landowners, and even carpet manufacturers like Mohawk Industries suing 3M over alleged PFAS contamination. The number of defendants involved also increased, with companies like DuPont, Chemours, and carpet manufacturers frequently appearing alongside 3M in lawsuits. This indicates a growing and more complex legal environment over time.",

          "chunk_text": "MDL. In November 2021, the defendants filed an omnibus motion regarding their government contractor defense. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a response.\n\nIn June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed eight AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. Two of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. Five cases remain pending in state courts where they are in early stages of litigation, after Valero dismissed its Ohio state court action without prejudice in October 2019. The parties in the state court cases have agreed to stay all five cases until March 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company is aware of 15 other AFFF suits originally filed in various state courts in which the Company has been named a defendant. Seven of these cases have been removed to federal court, where defendants have sought transfer to the AFFF MDL.\n\nTwo subsidiaries of Husky Energy filed suit in April 2020 against 3M and other AFFF manufacturers in Wisconsin state court relating to alleged PFAS contamination from AFFF use at Husky facilities in Superior, Wisconsin and Lima, Ohio. The parties have entered into a tolling agreement deferring further action on the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs filed a notice of dismissal without prejudice in September 2020.\n\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of firefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial amount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\n\n## Other PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M's customers' improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a AlliedSignal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc., Georgia-Pacific LLC, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., Chemours Co., and various carpet manufacturers.\n\nIn New York, 3M is defending 40 individual cases and one putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and four additional individual cases filed in New York state court against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (Saint-Gobain), Honeywell International Inc. and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. (DuPont). Tonaga, Inc. (Taconic) is also a defendant in the state court actions. Plaintiffs allege that PFOA discharged from fabric coating facilities operated by non3M entities (that allegedly had used PFOA-containing materials from 3M, among others) contaminated the drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, the Town of Hoosick and Petersburg, New York. They assert various tort claims for personal injury and property damage and in some cases request medical monitoring. 3M has answered the complaints in these individual cases, which are now proceeding through discovery. In the federal court individual cases, the parties selected 24 claimants in May 2021 for a pool from which eight plaintiffs will be chosen for expert discovery and dispositive motions. At the conclusion of these motions, the court will determine which case(s) will continue toward trial. In the putative class action, certain parties, including 3M, reached an agreement to resolve litigation among the settling parties. In February 2022, the district court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement. Under the agreement, 3M, Saint-Gobain and Honeywell will collectively contribute to a fixed total amount of approximately $65 million to resolve the plaintiffs' claims and those of the proposed classes. 3M's contribution is not considered material. 3M is also defending 13 cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York filed by various drinking water providers. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that products manufactured by 3M, DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants contaminated plaintiffs' water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. DuPont's motion to transfer these cases to the AFFF MDL was denied in March 2020. 3M has filed answers in these cases and discovery is ongoing.\n\nIn Michigan, one consolidated putative class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine World Wide (Wolverine). The action arises from Wolverine's allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to Wolverine's shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M's product contaminated the",

Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M's customers' improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater, surface water, or biosolids that were then land-applied. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including, but not limited to, DuPont, Chemours, and various carpet, paper, and textile manufacturers.\n\nThe cases brought on behalf of drinking water providers described below will be covered by the PWS Settlement if the water providers did not opt out of the PWS Settlement.\n\nIn Alabama, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending several state court cases brought by municipal water utilities. The plaintiffs in one of these cases (Shelby/Talladega Counties) are water utilities alleging that carpet manufacturers in Georgia improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River in Alabama. The case has a trial date in February 2026. In the second action, 3M is defending a putative class action by the Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the EPA. A trial date in the case has been set in June 2026. In the third case, the city of Albertville, Alabama filed suit for alleged contamination of the Tennessee River (upstream of 3M's Decatur facility) by a carpet manufacturer located upriver in Alabama. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss in May 2024, which is still pending. In the fourth case, the city of Mobile alleges that 3M and other defendants are responsible for PFAS contamination of the city's water supply resulting from PFAS released by a local landfill. In October 2024, the Court granted 3M's and several other defendants' motions to dismiss and in November 2024, 3M's co-defendants filed a motion asking the Court to certify the dismissal order as a final judgment. In the fifth case, the Town of Pine Hill, Alabama filed suit alleging that PFAS discharges from paper mills currently owned by International Paper have contaminated its water supply. 3M removed the case to federal court, and moved to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL. Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand the case to state court and an opposition to transfer. In the six th case, the City of Irondale, Alabama filed suit alleging PFAS contamination of its water supply due to industrial discharges from several users of PFAS in different industries, including alleged customers of 3M. 3M removed the case to federal court and moved to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL. Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand the case to state court and an opposition to transfer.\n\n3M is also defending a mass action filed in Alabama in June 2024 by hundreds of individual customers of the Water Works and Sewer Board for the City of Gadsden, Alabama, alleging emotional distress and property damage related to PFAS contamination of their drinking water. 3M removed the case to federal court.\n\nIn Georgia, 3M, together with co-defendants, is also defending a putative class action in federal court, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual ratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. The case is in discovery and no trial date has been set.\n\nAnother case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. Class certification has been fully briefed, and the plaintiff's injunctive relief claims were recently dismissed. Plaintiff's claims for economic damages related to alleged increases in their water rates due to the presence of PFAS remain pending.\n\nIn February 2024, two landowners in Gordon County, Georgia sued 3M and other defendants for alleged contamination of their properties from wastewater treatment sludge allegedly containing PFAS from nearby carpet manufacturing operations. One of 3M's co-defendant's, the City of Calhoun, Georgia, has filed a cross claim against 3M and other defendants alleging that biosolids from its wastewater treatment plant were contaminated with PFAS that has migrated into its water supply. In June 2024, a related lawsuit was filed on behalf of other property owners receiving biosolids from the same municipal water treatment plant. Motions to dismiss have been denied, and these claims are in active discovery. In July 2024, the City of Lyerly sued 3M and other defendants, alleging that discharges from local carpet mills contaminated the City's water supply. 3M has moved to dismiss those claims and oral argument on that motion took place on January 16, 2025.\n\nIn November 2024, Mohawk Industries, a carpet manufacturer, filed a lawsuit in Whitfield County, Georgia against 3M, DuPont, and Daikin alleging various counts of tort and contract liability, including fraud, related to sales of fluorochemicals.\n\nIn December 2024, Dalton Utilities, located in Dalton, Georgia, filed a suit against 3M, DuPont, Dakin, and several carpet manufacturers seeking clean-up costs under CERCLA for alleged PFAS contamination related to the Dalton Land Application System, which is a field that has received carpet mill effluent pursuant to a Georgia Environmental Protection Division permit since the late 1980s.",

      "question": "How has MMM's strategic positioning of Reflective Signage evolved within its Transportation and Electronics segment from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its integration with adjacent technologies and implied market focus?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Reflective Signage was listed alongside 'Premium large format graphic films for advertising and fleet signage' and 'Light management films and electronics assembly solutions,' indicating a focus on highway and vehicle safety applications. By 2023, MMM expanded the context of Reflective Signage by placing it among a broader suite of transportation technologies that included 'Chip packaging and interconnection solutions,' 'Semiconductor production materials,' and 'Solutions for data centers,' suggesting a shift toward integrating Reflective Signage into more technologically advanced transportation systems. In 2024, Reflective Signage remained in the Transportation and Electronics segment but was positioned between 'Premium large format graphic films' and 'Light management films and electronics assembly solutions,' with no mention of data center or semiconductor technologies, signaling a return to a more traditional safety-focused positioning. This 3-year trajectory reveals a strategic pivot in 2023 toward positioning Reflective Signage as part of a high-tech transportation ecosystem, followed by a reorientation in 2024 toward its core safety applications.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Fall Protection Solutions were listed alongside respiratory, hearing, and eye protection as part of a broader suite of safety offerings within the Safety and Industrial segment. By 2023, the listing order remained consistent, maintaining its position among core industrial safety products. In 2024, while still included within the Safety and Industrial segment, Fall Protection Solutions were presented with a slightly revised grouping that emphasized industrial specialty products and appeared to align more closely with broader industrial safety systems rather than being highlighted as a standalone category.

      "answer": "In 2022, 3M described its electrical products as serving 'construction and maintenance, power distribution and electrical OEMs' within the Safety and Industrial segment. In 2023, the company refined this description, specifying 'electrical original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)' rather than just 'electrical OEMs', suggesting increased precision in identifying its target market. By 2024, the language evolved further to 'power distribution and electrical original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)', adding continuity in power systems while retaining the formalized OEM reference. This progression indicates a growing strategic emphasis on the electrical OEM space, with increasing specificity in how MMM positions its electrical products within industrial ecosystems across the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did GE's collaboration with primary insurers on long-term care premium rate increases evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression reveal about GE's reinsurance risk management strategy in its run-off insurance operations?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, GE maintained a consistent reliance on primary insurers to file long-term care premium rate increases with state regulators, while increasingly emphasizing collaboration and alignment with ceding companies. In 2022, GE described its indirect role in seeking rate increases and noted that the frequency of such increases varied by ceding company. By 2023, GE formalized its collaboration with primary insurers under reinsurance contractual terms, and highlighted its active participation in filing proposed increases, signaling a more structured approach. In 2024, GE reinforced this collaborative framework and added that it used recent experience from ceding companies and regulatory precedents to shape its expectations. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward proactive risk management and tighter integration with primary insurers to stabilize future policy benefit reserves in its run-off insurance portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [GE](2022) \u2192 [Primary Insurers]: GE described its indirect role in long-term care premium rate increases, relying on primary insurers to file increases with regulators and noting variability across ceding companies.",
        "Hop 2: [GE](2023) \u2192 [Primary Insurers]: GE emphasized structured collaboration with primary insurers under reinsurance contracts to file proposed rate increases, indicating a more formalized partnership.",
        "Hop 3: [GE](2024) \u2192 [Primary Insurers]: GE further refined its approach by incorporating recent ceding company experience and regulatory precedents into its expectations, reflecting a matured and strategic alignment."

          "chunk_text": "Rate of Change in Morbidity . Our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim cost curves. These estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. This exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development. With respect to industry developments, we take into account that there are differences between and among industry peers in portfolio characteristics (such as demographic features of the insured populations), the aggregate effect of morbidity improvement or deterioration as applied to base claim cost projections, the extent to which such base cost projections reflect the most current experience, and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment. We assess the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projections, reconstructed in 2017. Projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have a material impact on our future claim cost projections, both on a stand-alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variables such as discount rate and premium rate increases.\n\nMortality . Mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. For life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments.\n\nDiscount rate . Interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. In estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. Lower future investment yields result in a lower discount rate and a higher present value of future policy benefit reserves.\n\nFuture long-term care premium rate increases . Long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. As a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. While we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. The amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. We consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations. Higher future premium rate increases lower the present value of future policy benefit reserves and lower future premium rate increases increase the present value of future policy benefit reserves.\n\nTerminations . Terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. Termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment. Lower termination rates increase, while higher termination rates decrease, the present value of expected future benefit payments.\n\nIn 2017, based on elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts, we initiated a comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumptions across all insurance products, resulting in a reconstruction of our future claim cost projections for long-term care insurance products. While our long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. However, the extent of actual experience since 2017 to date is limited in the context of a long-tailed, multi-decade portfolio.\n\n2021 Premium Deficiency Testing . We completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2021. These procedures included updating experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2020, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Our 2021 premium deficiency testing started with the positive margin of less than 2% of the recorded future policy benefit reserves that resulted from our 2020 premium deficiency testing. Using updated assumptions, the 2021 premium deficiency testing results indicated a significant increase in the positive margin to approximately 11% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2021. As a result, the assumptions updated in connection with the premium deficiency recognized in 2019 remain locked-in and will remain so unless another premium deficiency occurs in the future.",

          "chunk_text": "The primary cash flow assumptions used in the annual review include:\n\nMorbidity . M orbidity  assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care insurance exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utiliz ation (amount of av ailable benefits ex pected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last, including claim terminations due to death or recovery).\n\nRate of Change in M orbidity . Our review incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim incidence rates. These estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. This exercise of actuarial judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual review, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base assumptions, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and healthcare technology development.\n\nTerminations . Terminations include active life mortality and lapse. M ortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. Lapse refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to non-payment of premiums by a policyholder. Lapse rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment.\n\nFuture long-term care premium rate increases . Substantially all long-term care insurance policies that are currently premium paying allow the issuing insurance entity  to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. A s a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. While we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. The amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. We consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations.\n\nIncluded in Insurance losses and annuity benefits in our Statement of Earnings (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, are favorable and unfavorable pre-tax adjustments of $196 million and $(155) million, respectively, from updating the net premium ratio (i.e., the percentage of projected gross premiums required to cover expected policy benefits and related expenses) after updating for actual historical experience each quarter and updating of future cash flow assumptions in the third quarter of each year.\n\nSensitivities. The following table provides sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves using the locked-in discount rate assumption and have been estimated across the entire product line rather than at an individual cohort level. A s our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves. M any of our assumptions, which are based on our credible experience, are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below. In addition, the effects of changes to cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves may be partially or wholly reflected in the period in which the assumptions are changed and/or over future periods and may vary across cohorts.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) was disclosed as a captive property and casualty insurance subsidiary primarily serving GE and its employees, with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, GE had classified EIC as 'held for sale' and recorded a $109 million loss in connection with the expected sale, reflecting a strategic decision to divest non-core assets. In 2024, the sale of EIC was completed to Riverstone International Holdings Inc. for $120 million in cash. This progression shows GE's deliberate move to exit captive insurance as part of a broader restructuring effort to focus on core industrial and aerospace operations, while also recognizing financial losses associated with non-core divestitures.",

          "chunk_text": "## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, GE's exposure to trailing legal liabilities remained a persistent risk, with specific reference to legacy matters from the 2015 Alstom acquisition and shareholder lawsuits tied to historical financial reporting. In 2022, GE noted that legacy legal proceedings from Alstom's pre-acquisition period, including claims of anti-competitive conduct or corruption, were resulting in ongoing cash outflows. Additionally, shareholder lawsuits related to GE\u2019s financial performance and disclosure practices were highlighted as reputational risks. By 2023, the company reiterated its exposure to these same Alstom-related liabilities and emphasized that such legal matters could exceed current estimates, adversely affecting financial results. In 2024, GE continued to face shareholder lawsuits tied to legacy financial reporting issues, and the company acknowledged that these matters, along with contingent liabilities from exited businesses, could significantly impact its reputation and financial performance.

          "chunk_text": "required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant reduction or increase to equity. The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to changes in key economic indicators, and future decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans under ERISA. Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors, which could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility, could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans. In addition, there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current and future retirees. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to control increases in these costs will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligations, see Note 12.\n\nLEGAL &amp; COMPLIANCE RISKS. Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment, legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including matters relating to financial reporting and the environment, health and safety. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to make adverse changes to our business models or practices.\n\nRegulatory - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways. Our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. In particular, recent trends globally toward increased protectionism, import and export controls and the use of tariffs and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our businesses that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, anti-corruption, competition law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, states or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws, could increase our costs or tax rate. In addition, efforts by public and private sectors to control healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements and increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. Inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status with such customers or our ability to participate in projects, and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to do bid for business with certain government-related customers or to participate in projects involving multilateral development banks, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nLegal proceedings - We are subject to legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including trailing liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives, and the industries in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union, China and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and/or damages that could be material. For example, following our acquisition of Alstom's Thermal, Renewables and Grid businesses in 2015, we are subject to legacy legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or corruption by Alstom in the pre-acquisition period, and payments for settlements, judgments, penalties or other liabilities in connection with those matters have resulted and will in the future result in cash outflows. In addition, while in December 2020 we entered into a settlement to conclude the previously disclosed SEC investigation of GE, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters. We have observed that these proceedings related to claims about past financial performance and reporting pose particular reputational risks for the Company that can cause new allegations about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, to have a more significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others than they otherwise would. We have established reserves for legal matters when and as appropriate; however, the estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly in light of the global and diverse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving GE employees or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. Moreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law,",

          "chunk_text": "outright. In particular, recent trends globally  toward increased protectionism, import and export controls, required licenses or authorizations to engage in business with certain countries or entities, the use of tariffs, restrictions on outbound investment and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. In addition, changes in environmental and climate change laws, regulations or policies (including emissions pricing and taxes, emissions standards or sustainable finance, among others) affecting the aerospace and defense sector could lead to additional costs or compliance requirements, a need for additional investment in product designs, require carbon offset investments or otherwise negatively impact our business or competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our business that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, artificial intelligence, anti-corruption, competition law, public procurement law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, technical regulations or local content requirements that could result in market access criteria that our products cannot or do not meet, restrictions related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFA S), foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity  from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax  laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws such as global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income, could increase our cash tax costs and effective tax rate. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits and investigations that in the past have led, and in the future may lead, to cash withholds, fines, damages or other penalties under civil or criminal laws. Inability to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our status with government customers or our ability to participate in projects and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to bid for new U.S. government contracts or business with other government-related customers, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nLegal proceedings - We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including contingent liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives and our industry are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages that could be material. For example, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters from several years ago. These types of proceedings involving claims about past financial performance and reporting, as well as any future claims that may arise about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, may have a significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others. We also from time to time are involved in commercial discussions, disputes or proceedings in which, given the nature of our business that often involves large equipment and service orders and long-term commercial relationships, the claims asserted can be for significant amounts. The estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation, disputes and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our financial results. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly in light of the global and div erse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving our employees, partners or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to the relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we have exited or are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. M oreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in those markets. See Note 24 for further information about legal proceedings and other loss contingencies.\n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

      "question": "How did GE's financial exposure and strategic handling of Bank BPH's borrower litigation evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of estimated losses, capital contributions, and the carrying value of the mortgage portfolio?",
      "answer": "GE's financial exposure to Bank BPH's borrower litigation increased significantly in 2023, with estimated losses rising to $2,669 million by year-end from $1,359 million in 2022, and a $1,014 million charge recorded in Q2 2023 as part of a settlement program. Capital contributions also spiked in 2023, with a non-cash contribution of $1,797 million through intercompany loan forgiveness, following a $530 million cash contribution in 2022. By 2024, estimated losses slightly declined to $2,461 million, and no further contributions were required. Additionally, the carrying value of the Bank BPH mortgage portfolio dropped to zero by the end of 2024, indicating a full valuation write-down. This trajectory shows a worsening litigation environment through 2023 followed by stabilization in 2024, with GE absorbing significant losses and ultimately exiting active involvement in Bank BPH.",

          "chunk_text": "We estimate potential losses for Bank BPH in connection with borrower litigation cases that are pending by recording legal reserves, as well as in connection with potential future cases or other adverse developments as part of our ongoing valuation of the Bank BPH portfolio, which we record at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. The total amount of such estimated losses was $755 million and $315 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We update our assumptions underlying the amount of estimated losses based primarily on the number of lawsuits filed and estimated to be filed in the future, whether liability will be established in lawsuits and the nature of the remedy ordered by courts if liability is established. The increase in the amount of estimated losses during 2021 was driven primarily by increases in the number of lawsuits estimated to be filed in the future and increased findings of liability. We expect the trends we have previously reported of an increasing number of lawsuits being filed, more findings of liability and more severe remedies being ordered against Polish banks (including Bank BPH) to continue in future reporting periods, although Bank BPH is unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses associated with active and inactive Bank BPH mortgage loans beyond the amounts currently recorded. Additional factors may also affect our estimated losses over time, including: potentially significant judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court; the impact of any of these or other future or recent decisions or resolutions (including the ECJ decision in April 2021 on a case involving a Bank BPH mortgage loan, and the Polish Supreme Court binding resolution delivered verbally in May 2021 with written reasoning issued in July 2021) on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases and how borrower behavior may change in response, neither of which are known immediately upon the issuance of a decision or resolution; uncertainty related to a proposal by the Chairman of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority in December 2020 that banks voluntarily offer borrowers an opportunity to convert their foreign currency denominated mortgage loans to Polish zlotys using an exchange rate applicable at the date of loan origination, and about the various settlement strategies or other approaches that Polish banks have adopted or will adopt, or that Bank BPH may adopt in the future, in response to this proposal or other factors, and the approaches that regulators and other government authorities will adopt in response; and uncertainty arising from investigations of the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK), including existing or anticipated UOKiK decisions resulting from those investigations. Future adverse developments related to any of the foregoing, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators or other governmental authorities, likely would have a material adverse effect on Bank BPH and the carrying value of its mortgage loan portfolio as well as result in additional required capital contributions to Bank BPH or significant losses beyond the amounts that we currently estimate.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS . Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup described below, and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims were $2,660 million and $2,569 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAs previously reported, in 2000, GE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into a consent decree relating to PCB cleanup of the Housatonic River in Massachusetts. Following the EPA's release in September 2015 of an intended final remediation decision, GE and the EPA engaged in mediation and the first step of the dispute resolution process contemplated by the consent decree. In October 2016, the EPA issued its final decision pursuant to the consent decree, which GE and several other interested parties appealed to the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board (EAB). The EAB issued its decision in January 2018, affirming parts of the EPA's decision and granting relief to GE on certain significant elements of its challenge. The EAB remanded the decision back to the EPA to address those elements and reissue a revised final remedy, and the EPA convened a mediation process with GE and interested stakeholders. In February 2020, the EPA announced an agreement between the EPA and many of the mediation stakeholders, including GE, concerning a revised Housatonic River remedy. Based on the mediated resolution, the EPA solicited public comment on a draft permit and issued the final revised permit effective in January 2021. In March 2021, two local environmental advocacy groups filed a joint petition to the EAB challenging portions of the revised permit, and EPA and GE are defending that appeal. As of December 31, 2021, and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances and its defenses, GE believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with the proposed final remedy.\n\nExpenditures for site remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $193 million, $180 million and $236 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately $350 million and $250 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 23. OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nBASIS FOR PRESENTATION.

The separation was structured as a tax-free spin-off and was achieved through the Company's pro-rata distribution of all the outstanding shares of GE V ernova to holders of the Company's common stock. In connection with the GE Vernova separation, the historical results of GE V ernova and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in GE A erospace consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. In addition, the Company contributed $515 million of cash to fund GE V ernova's future operations such that GE Vernova's cash balance on the date of separation was $4,242 million.\n\nWe have continuing involvement with GE Vernova primarily through ongoing sales of products, a transition services agreement, through which GE A erospace and GE Vernova continue to provide certain services to each other for a period of time following the separation, a separation and distribution agreement, including performance and financial guarantees, a tax matters agreement and a trademark licensing agreement. For the nine months (post separation) ended December 31, 2024, we had direct and indirect sales of $248 million to GE V ernova, primarily related to engine sales and parts. We collected net cash of $943 million related to the transition services agreement and sales of engines and parts in 2024.\n\nGE HealthCare. On January 3, 2023, we completed the previously announced separation of our HealthCare business, into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare). The separation was structured as a tax-free spin-off and was achieved through the Company's pro-rata distribution of approximately 80.1% of the outstanding shares of GE HealthCare to holders of the Company's common stock. In connection with the separation, the historical results of GE HealthCare and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in GE A erospace consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\n\nWe have continuing involvement with GE HealthCare primarily through a transition services agreement, through which GE A erospace and GE HealthCare continue to provide certain services to each other for a period of time following the separation, a tax matters agreement and a trademark licensing agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we collected net cash of $230 million related to these activities. A s of December 31, 2024, the transition services agreement was completed.\n\nBank BPH . A s prev iously  reported, Bank BPH, along with other Polish banks, has been subject to ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of floating rate residential mortgage loans, with cases brought by individual borrowers seeking relief related to their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans in various courts throughout Poland. A s previously reported, a settlement program was adopted and we recorded a charge of $1,014 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH was $2,461 million and $2,669 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In order to maintain appropriate regulatory capital levels, in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we made the previously reported non-cash capital contributions in the form of intercompany loan forgiveness of $1,797 million; no incremental contributions from GE A erospace were required in 2024. For further information about factors that are relevant to the estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH, see Note 24. Future changes or adverse developments could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH.\n\nThe Bank BPH financing receivable portfolio is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, which reflects market yields and estimates with respect to ongoing borrower litigation. A t December 31, 2024, the total portfolio had no carrying value, net of a valuation allowance. Earnings (loss) related to ongoing borrower litigation included zero, $1,189 million and $720 million in pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n48 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "question": "How did GE's holdings of the AerCap note evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression suggest about GE's investment strategy in financial instruments during this period?",
      "answer": "GE's holdings of the AerCap note decreased from $976 million in 2022 to $944 million in 2023, but then increased to $982 million in 2024. This fluctuation suggests a dynamic approach to managing financial assets, with a slight overall stability in AerCap note holdings despite broader changes in GE's portfolio composition, including significant shifts in U.S. corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities over the same period.",

      "question": "How did the legal exposure and associated settlement costs related to 3M's Scotchgard product evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend reveal about the financial impact of PFAS-related litigation on the company?",
      "answer": "In 2022, 3M was defending multiple lawsuits in New York and Michigan, including a consolidated putative class action in Michigan related to Wolverine's disposal of Scotchgard, with 3M contributing to a $65 million settlement alongside Saint-Gobain and Honeywell. By 2023, the legal exposure had expanded, with 3M facing approximately 68 AFFF suits outside the MDL and additional PFAS-related suits, including a case in Illinois and a Canadian class action, while also finalizing a non-material settlement in Michigan related to Wolverine's disposal practices. In 2024, litigation expanded further into Alabama and Georgia, with multiple lawsuits from municipal water utilities, property owners, and carpet manufacturers, including a $65 million settlement in New York being finalized and ongoing litigation in Alabama with trial dates set for 2026. This trend reveals a growing financial burden from PFAS-related litigation, with increasing geographic spread and case complexity, suggesting that the company's liabilities and legal costs associated with Scotchgard are escalating over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MMM](2023) \u2192 [Scotchgard]: 3M contributed to a non-material portion of a $65 million settlement in Michigan related to Wolverine's disposal of Scotchgard and faced approximately 68 AFFF suits outside the MDL.",

        "Hop 3: [MMM](2022) \u2192 [Scotchgard]: 3M was defending 40 individual cases and one putative class action in New York, and a consolidated class action in Michigan, with a $65 million settlement approved in February 2022."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M's customers' improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater, surface water, or biosolids that were then land-applied. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including, but not limited to, DuPont, Chemours, and various carpet, paper, and textile manufacturers.\n\nThe cases brought on behalf of drinking water providers described below will be covered by the PWS Settlement if the water providers did not opt out of the PWS Settlement.\n\nIn Alabama, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending several state court cases brought by municipal water utilities. The plaintiffs in one of these cases (Shelby/Talladega Counties) are water utilities alleging that carpet manufacturers in Georgia improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River in Alabama. The case has a trial date in February 2026. In the second action, 3M is defending a putative class action by the Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the EPA. A trial date in the case has been set in June 2026. In the third case, the city of Albertville, Alabama filed suit for alleged contamination of the Tennessee River (upstream of 3M's Decatur facility) by a carpet manufacturer located upriver in Alabama. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss in May 2024, which is still pending. In the fourth case, the city of Mobile alleges that 3M and other defendants are responsible for PFAS contamination of the city's water supply resulting from PFAS released by a local landfill. In October 2024, the Court granted 3M's and several other defendants' motions to dismiss and in November 2024, 3M's co-defendants filed a motion asking the Court to certify the dismissal order as a final judgment. In the fifth case, the Town of Pine Hill, Alabama filed suit alleging that PFAS discharges from paper mills currently owned by International Paper have contaminated its water supply. 3M removed the case to federal court, and moved to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL. Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand the case to state court and an opposition to transfer. In the six th case, the City of Irondale, Alabama filed suit alleging PFAS contamination of its water supply due to industrial discharges from several users of PFAS in different industries, including alleged customers of 3M. 3M removed the case to federal court and moved to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL. Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand the case to state court and an opposition to transfer.\n\n3M is also defending a mass action filed in Alabama in June 2024 by hundreds of individual customers of the Water Works and Sewer Board for the City of Gadsden, Alabama, alleging emotional distress and property damage related to PFAS contamination of their drinking water. 3M removed the case to federal court.\n\nIn Georgia, 3M, together with co-defendants, is also defending a putative class action in federal court, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual ratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. The case is in discovery and no trial date has been set.\n\nAnother case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. Class certification has been fully briefed, and the plaintiff's injunctive relief claims were recently dismissed. Plaintiff's claims for economic damages related to alleged increases in their water rates due to the presence of PFAS remain pending.\n\nIn February 2024, two landowners in Gordon County, Georgia sued 3M and other defendants for alleged contamination of their properties from wastewater treatment sludge allegedly containing PFAS from nearby carpet manufacturing operations. One of 3M's co-defendant's, the City of Calhoun, Georgia, has filed a cross claim against 3M and other defendants alleging that biosolids from its wastewater treatment plant were contaminated with PFAS that has migrated into its water supply. In June 2024, a related lawsuit was filed on behalf of other property owners receiving biosolids from the same municipal water treatment plant. Motions to dismiss have been denied, and these claims are in active discovery. In July 2024, the City of Lyerly sued 3M and other defendants, alleging that discharges from local carpet mills contaminated the City's water supply. 3M has moved to dismiss those claims and oral argument on that motion took place on January 16, 2025.\n\nIn November 2024, Mohawk Industries, a carpet manufacturer, filed a lawsuit in Whitfield County, Georgia against 3M, DuPont, and Daikin alleging various counts of tort and contract liability, including fraud, related to sales of fluorochemicals.\n\nIn December 2024, Dalton Utilities, located in Dalton, Georgia, filed a suit against 3M, DuPont, Dakin, and several carpet manufacturers seeking clean-up costs under CERCLA for alleged PFAS contamination related to the Dalton Land Application System, which is a field that has received carpet mill effluent pursuant to a Georgia Environmental Protection Division permit since the late 1980s.",

          "chunk_text": "MDL. In November 2021, the defendants filed an omnibus motion regarding their government contractor defense. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a response.\n\nIn June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed eight AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. Two of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. Five cases remain pending in state courts where they are in early stages of litigation, after Valero dismissed its Ohio state court action without prejudice in October 2019. The parties in the state court cases have agreed to stay all five cases until March 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company is aware of 15 other AFFF suits originally filed in various state courts in which the Company has been named a defendant. Seven of these cases have been removed to federal court, where defendants have sought transfer to the AFFF MDL.\n\nTwo subsidiaries of Husky Energy filed suit in April 2020 against 3M and other AFFF manufacturers in Wisconsin state court relating to alleged PFAS contamination from AFFF use at Husky facilities in Superior, Wisconsin and Lima, Ohio. The parties have entered into a tolling agreement deferring further action on the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs filed a notice of dismissal without prejudice in September 2020.\n\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of firefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial amount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\n\n## Other PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M's customers' improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a AlliedSignal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc., Georgia-Pacific LLC, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., Chemours Co., and various carpet manufacturers.\n\nIn New York, 3M is defending 40 individual cases and one putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and four additional individual cases filed in New York state court against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (Saint-Gobain), Honeywell International Inc. and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. (DuPont). Tonaga, Inc. (Taconic) is also a defendant in the state court actions. Plaintiffs allege that PFOA discharged from fabric coating facilities operated by non3M entities (that allegedly had used PFOA-containing materials from 3M, among others) contaminated the drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, the Town of Hoosick and Petersburg, New York. They assert various tort claims for personal injury and property damage and in some cases request medical monitoring. 3M has answered the complaints in these individual cases, which are now proceeding through discovery. In the federal court individual cases, the parties selected 24 claimants in May 2021 for a pool from which eight plaintiffs will be chosen for expert discovery and dispositive motions. At the conclusion of these motions, the court will determine which case(s) will continue toward trial. In the putative class action, certain parties, including 3M, reached an agreement to resolve litigation among the settling parties. In February 2022, the district court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement. Under the agreement, 3M, Saint-Gobain and Honeywell will collectively contribute to a fixed total amount of approximately $65 million to resolve the plaintiffs' claims and those of the proposed classes. 3M's contribution is not considered material. 3M is also defending 13 cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York filed by various drinking water providers. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that products manufactured by 3M, DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants contaminated plaintiffs' water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. DuPont's motion to transfer these cases to the AFFF MDL was denied in March 2020. 3M has filed answers in these cases and discovery is ongoing.\n\nIn Michigan, one consolidated putative class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine World Wide (Wolverine). The action arises from Wolverine's allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to Wolverine's shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M's product contaminated the",

      "question": "How did the positioning of Reflective Signage within MMM's Transportation and Electronics segment evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this sequence suggest about its strategic importance in MMM's product portfolio?",
      "answer": "Reflective Signage remained a consistent offering within MMM's Transportation and Electronics segment across all three years, but its relative positioning within the product list changed, potentially signaling shifts in strategic emphasis. In 2022, Reflective Signage was listed fifth among offerings, following advanced ceramics and attachment tapes but preceding light management films and electronics assembly solutions. In 2023, it moved up to the fourth position, directly after premium large format graphic films and before light management films and electronics assembly solutions. In 2024, Reflective Signage remained in the fourth position but was now placed after 'sound and temperature management' and before 'Light management films and electronics assembly solutions.' This consistent placement in the top half of the segment's offerings over three years suggests ongoing strategic relevance, with a slight early boost in prominence in 2023 that was maintained in 2024.",

In 2022, fall protection was listed among a broader set of safety offerings including respiratory, hearing, and eye protection. In 2023, the listing remained consistent, indicating continued emphasis on integrated safety solutions. By 2024, the phrasing slightly evolved to 'respiratory, hearing, eye and fall protection solutions,' maintaining the same product grouping but with a more concise presentation.

      "answer": "MMM consistently listed 'Electrical products and materials for construction and maintenance, power distribution and electrical OEMs' as part of its Safety and Industrial segment in all three years. However, in 2022, the description included 'Closure systems for personal hygiene products, masking, and packaging materials' alongside electrical products, emphasizing a broader industrial offering. In 2023, MMM maintained the same focus on electrical products but added 'Industrial abrasives and finishing for metalworking applications' and 'Autobody repair solutions' as key components of the Safety and Industrial segment, suggesting a continued but slightly expanded industrial focus. By 2024, MMM retained the core electrical product line but rephrased the segment description to 'Industrial abrasives and finishing for metalworking applications' and 'Industrial specialty products such as personal hygiene products, masking, and packaging materials', indicating a potential shift toward emphasizing broader industrial specialties while maintaining electrical offerings. This 3-year progression shows MMM's consistent commitment to electrical products for construction and maintenance, while subtly evolving its industrial portfolio to align with broader market opportunities.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Honeywell consistently highlighted the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment as being adversely impacted by industry economic conditions, with specific emphasis on reduced investments in process automation, fluctuations in retail markets, and product commoditization. In 2022, the segment cited reduced investments in process automation, retail market fluctuations, and new market entrants leading to commoditization and lower margins. In 2023, similar risks were reiterated, with additional mention of adverse industry economic conditions contributing to lower market share and reduced selling prices. By 2024, the restructured Industrial Automation segment (formerly part of Safety and Productivity Solutions) continued to face these pressures, with an explicit link drawn between adverse industry economic conditions and margin compression. This consistent linkage over three years indicates a persistent vulnerability in this business line despite broader organizational restructuring.",

Disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\n\nEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\n\n- Aerospace Technologies -Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability , factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utiliz ation rates. O perating results may  also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for events related to public health, safety , the environment, or regional conflicts. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.\n- Industrial Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utiliz ation initiativ es, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins.\n- Building Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global buildings and infrastructure construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.\n- Energy and Sustainability Solutions -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply , product  commoditization,  continued  illegal  imports  of  hydrofluorocarbons  into  Europe,  and  our  ability  to  maximize  our  facilities'  production  capacity  and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory , foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact  our  business,  operations  and  financial  results  will  depend  on  numerous  evolving  factors  that  we  may  not  be  able  to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, including emergence and impact of new variants; some of which have been, and may be in the future, more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain, and any continued increase in cases globally and across the United States in particular, including breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated population, as well as the timing, availability, and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines; the pace of vaccine deployment; the impact of vaccine mandates, governmental, business and individual decisions and actions; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; and the extent to which we or our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers or other business partners may be prevented  from  conducting  normal  business  activities,  including  due  to  shutdowns  or  other  restrictive  measures  that  may  be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) the purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) our liquidity and cash flow.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's risk exposure to new aircraft order cancellations change from 2022 through 2024, based on its annual disclosures, and what does this trend suggest about the recovery trajectory of the global aerospace market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell explicitly linked the risk of new aircraft order cancellations to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including regional restrictions and reduced air travel demand. By 2023, the company maintained the same risk factor but removed specific references to the pandemic, suggesting a normalization of conditions while still acknowledging the potential for cancellations due to demand fluctuations. In 2024, Honeywell continued to highlight new aircraft order cancellations as a risk but shifted focus toward broader market dynamics, such as new entrants and non-traditional players affecting end-market demand. This evolution indicates a gradual recovery in the aerospace sector, with pandemic-related disruptions receding and structural industry changes becoming more prominent. The trend suggests that while the immediate risk of cancellations due to public health events has diminished, Honeywell still faces exposure from evolving market forces in the aerospace industry.",

        "Hop 1: [HON](2023) \u2192 [New Aircraft Order Cancellations]: Risk factor remains prominent; no explicit mention of pandemic, but continued emphasis on air travel demand affecting production and order stability.",

Disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\n\nEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\n\n- Aerospace Technologies -Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability , factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utiliz ation rates. O perating results may  also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for events related to public health, safety , the environment, or regional conflicts. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.\n- Industrial Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utiliz ation initiativ es, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins.\n- Building Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global buildings and infrastructure construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.\n- Energy and Sustainability Solutions -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply , product  commoditization,  continued  illegal  imports  of  hydrofluorocarbons  into  Europe,  and  our  ability  to  maximize  our  facilities'  production  capacity  and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory , foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact  our  business,  operations  and  financial  results  will  depend  on  numerous  evolving  factors  that  we  may  not  be  able  to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, including emergence and impact of new variants; some of which have been, and may be in the future, more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain, and any continued increase in cases globally and across the United States in particular, including breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated population, as well as the timing, availability, and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines; the pace of vaccine deployment; the impact of vaccine mandates, governmental, business and individual decisions and actions; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; and the extent to which we or our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers or other business partners may be prevented  from  conducting  normal  business  activities,  including  due  to  shutdowns  or  other  restrictive  measures  that  may  be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) the purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) our liquidity and cash flow.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's exposure to raw material demand and supply risks evolve across its Performance Materials and Technologies segment from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's vulnerability to commodity market volatility?",
      "answer": "Honeywell consistently highlighted raw material demand and supply as a key risk factor for its Performance Materials and Technologies segment across all three years. In 2022, the risk was framed in the context of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including disruptions to global supply chains and customer capital availability. By 2023, the company emphasized continued exposure to raw material supply volatility, particularly in relation to chemical, refining, and semiconductor plant utilization rates. In 2024, the risk remained prominent, with additional emphasis on the impact of oil and natural gas price volatility on customer investment behavior. This 3-year progression indicates a sustained vulnerability to commodity-driven supply chain instability, with the risk profile intensifying as energy markets became more volatile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [HON](2023) \u2192 [Raw Material Demand and Supply]: In 2023, Honeywell cited raw material demand and supply as a key risk for Performance Materials and Technologies, tied to capacity utilization in chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, as well as customer capital availability for refinery construction and expansion.",
        "Hop 2: [HON](2024) \u2192 [Raw Material Demand and Supply]: In 2024, the risk remained, with added emphasis on how volatility in oil and natural gas prices was affecting customer investment, leading to lower demand for Honeywell's products and services.",
        "Hop 3: [HON](2022) \u2192 [Raw Material Demand and Supply]: In 2022, the company identified raw material demand and supply as a risk factor for Performance Materials and Technologies, with specific mention of customer capital constraints and the lingering effects of the global pandemic on supply chains."

      "question": "How did Honeywell's exposure to changes in the competitive landscape evolve across its business segments from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of new market entrants, technological disruption, and resulting impacts on market share and pricing power?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Honeywell consistently highlighted increasing exposure to changes in the competitive landscape across its business segments, with a growing emphasis on the impact of new market entrants and technological disruption. In 2022, Honeywell cited changes in the competitive landscape\u2014including new entrants and new technologies\u2014as a risk factor for Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions, noting potential consequences such as lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins. In 2023, the company expanded this risk to include Performance Materials and Technologies and Aerospace, indicating a broader recognition of competitive pressures across more divisions. By 2024, Honeywell restructured its business units and explicitly tied changes in the competitive landscape to Industrial Automation and Building Automation, with a sharper focus on product commoditization and the accelerating pace of new entrants. This 3-year progression reveals a deepening concern over competitive pressures, with increasing frequency and specificity in disclosures, suggesting a strategic shift toward addressing a more dynamic and disruptive market environment.",

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact  our  business,  operations  and  financial  results  will  depend  on  numerous  evolving  factors  that  we  may  not  be  able  to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, including emergence and impact of new variants; some of which have been, and may be in the future, more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain, and any continued increase in cases globally and across the United States in particular, including breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated population, as well as the timing, availability, and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines; the pace of vaccine deployment; the impact of vaccine mandates, governmental, business and individual decisions and actions; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; and the extent to which we or our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers or other business partners may be prevented  from  conducting  normal  business  activities,  including  due  to  shutdowns  or  other  restrictive  measures  that  may  be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) the purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) our liquidity and cash flow.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's exposure to fluctuations in retail markets evolve across its Safety and Productivity Solutions segment in 2022, Industrial Automation segment in 2024, and the legacy Safety and Productivity Solutions segment in 2023, and what does this progression reveal about the company's sensitivity to consumer-driven demand volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell's Safety and Productivity Solutions segment cited 'fluctuations in retail markets' as a risk factor impacting operating results due to reduced investments in process automation and safety monitoring. In 2023, the same segment again highlighted 'fluctuations in retail markets' as a risk, linking it to slowdowns in demand for safety products and competitive pressures. By 2024, the company restructured its business units, and the Industrial Automation segment now carries this risk, continuing to cite 'fluctuations in retail markets' as a factor affecting demand for safety and automation products. This shows a consistent sensitivity to retail-driven demand volatility, despite organizational restructuring, indicating that the company's industrial automation and safety offerings remain closely tied to broader consumer market dynamics.",

Disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\n\nEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\n\n- Aerospace Technologies -Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability , factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utiliz ation rates. O perating results may  also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for events related to public health, safety , the environment, or regional conflicts. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.\n- Industrial Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utiliz ation initiativ es, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins.\n- Building Automation -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global buildings and infrastructure construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.\n- Energy and Sustainability Solutions -Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply , product  commoditization,  continued  illegal  imports  of  hydrofluorocarbons  into  Europe,  and  our  ability  to  maximize  our  facilities'  production  capacity  and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory , foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How has Honeywell's exposure to new aircraft order cancellations evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the aerospace industry's recovery and Honeywell's strategic positioning?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell cited the impact of the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including regional restrictions and public health events, as key drivers behind potential new aircraft order cancellations. By 2023, the language remained largely unchanged, indicating that the risk persisted without significant mitigation. In 2024, the risk factor expanded to include broader environmental and geopolitical concerns, such as regional conflicts and environmental events, as potential causes for cancellations. This evolution suggests a slow recovery in the aerospace sector, with Honeywell still exposed to demand volatility, and highlights the company's ongoing need to adapt its aerospace strategy in response to external disruptions.",

Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.\n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory , foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's exposure to raw material demand and supply risks evolve across its Performance Materials and Technologies segment from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's vulnerability to commodity market volatility?",
      "answer": "Honeywell consistently highlighted raw material demand and supply as a key risk factor for its Performance Materials and Technologies segment across all three years. In 2022, the risk was tied to capacity utilization in chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, customer capital availability, and product commoditization. By 2023, the company reiterated the same exposure but placed increased emphasis on illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe and production capacity optimization. In 2024, the segment\u2014renamed Energy and Sustainability Solutions\u2014continued to cite raw material demand and supply as a risk, with expanded mention of oil and natural gas price volatility affecting customer investment behavior. This evolution shows a consistent but deepening concern over external commodity market forces influencing the business over time.",

Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events, such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted our operating results.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact  our  business,  operations  and  financial  results  will  depend  on  numerous  evolving  factors  that  we  may  not  be  able  to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, including emergence and impact of new variants; some of which have been, and may be in the future, more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain, and any continued increase in cases globally and across the United States in particular, including breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated population, as well as the timing, availability, and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines; the pace of vaccine deployment; the impact of vaccine mandates, governmental, business and individual decisions and actions; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; and the extent to which we or our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers or other business partners may be prevented  from  conducting  normal  business  activities,  including  due  to  shutdowns  or  other  restrictive  measures  that  may  be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) the purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) our liquidity and cash flow.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's exposure to changes in the competitive landscape evolve across its Safety and Productivity Solutions, Honeywell Building Technologies, and Industrial Automation businesses from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about increasing market pressures and product commoditization risks over time?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Honeywell's disclosures show a growing emphasis on the risk of changes in the competitive landscape across its Safety and Productivity Solutions (2022), Honeywell Building Technologies (2023), and Industrial Automation (2024) businesses. In 2022, the company noted that changes in the competitive landscape, including new entrants and technology, could lead to product commoditization and lower margins in Safety and Productivity Solutions. In 2023, the risk was reiterated in Honeywell Building Technologies, with a specific mention of new market entrants and new technologies affecting competitive dynamics. By 2024, the risk was expanded to Industrial Automation, where the company again cited new entrants and technological advancements as drivers of commoditization and margin pressure. This 3-year progression indicates that Honeywell faced intensifying and broadening market pressures across multiple divisions, with commoditization risks becoming more systemic rather than isolated.",

Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export, and other trade restrictions and barriers (such as tariffs, sanctions, and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property , acts of  industrial  espionage,  violations  by  our  employees  of  anti-corruption  laws  (despite  our  efforts  to  mitigate  such  risk),  changes  in  regulations  regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory , and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers,  and  trends  such  as  populism,  economic  nationalism,  and  negative  sentiment  toward  multinational  companies,  as  well  as  the  cost  of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.\n\n28 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's exposure to fluctuations in retail markets impact its Safety and Productivity Solutions segment across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this reveal about the segment's vulnerability to consumer demand volatility over time?",
      "answer": "Honeywell consistently highlighted that its Safety and Productivity Solutions segment (in 2022) and its Industrial Automation segment (in 2024, previously named in 2023 as Safety and Productivity Solutions) were adversely impacted by fluctuations in retail markets across all three years. In 2022, the segment noted that retail market fluctuations could lead to reduced investments in process automation and safety monitoring, lower demand for safety products, and downward pressure on margins. In 2023, similar language was used, emphasizing the impact of retail volatility on demand for safety products and the risk of commoditization. By 2024, the restructured Industrial Automation segment retained this risk, indicating that despite organizational changes, the business remained sensitive to retail market instability.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS's 7.620% debentures remained consistent in principal amount ($276 million) and maturity date (April 1, 2030). However, the disclosures evolved in terms of clarity and emphasis on redemption terms. In 2022, UPS clarified that the interest rate had been reduced from 8.375% to 7.620% in April 2020 for the remaining term, while in 2023 and 2024, the interest rate was consistently reported as 7.620%, with no further changes. The redemption terms were consistent across all three years, with the debentures being callable at any time at UPS's option, with the redemption price based on either principal plus accrued interest or the present value of remaining payments discounted at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points. In 2024, the disclosure placed more emphasis on the semi-annual interest payment schedule and confirmed that the debentures are not subject to sinking fund requirements. This consistency in structure and increasing clarity in disclosure suggests a stable long-term debt instrument with well-defined terms.",

These debentures had an interest rate of 8.375% until April 1, 2020, at which time the interest rate decreased to 7.620% for the remaining term. These debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time. The redemption price is equal to the greater of the principal amount plus accrued interest, or the present value of remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points, plus accrued interest. Interest is payable semi-annually in April and October, and the debentures are not subject to sinking fund requirements.\n\n## Floating-Rate Senior Notes\n\nOur floating-rate senior notes bear interest at rates that reference the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") for U.S. Dollars. As part of a broader program of reference rate reform, it is expected that U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates will cease to be published after June 2023.\n\nWe have floating-rate senior notes in the principal amounts of $400 and $500 million that bear interest at three-month LIBOR, plus a spread of 38 and 45 basis points, respectively. These notes are not callable. The $400 million notes mature in 2022 and the $500 million notes mature in 2023, prior to the expected discontinuance of U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The average interest rate for 2021 and 2020, including interest on the $350 million floating-rate senior notes that matured on April 1, 2021, was 0.58% and 1.29%, respectively.\n\nThe remaining floating-rate senior notes, with principal amounts totaling $1.0 billion, bear interest at either one or threemonth LIBOR, less a spread ranging from 30 to 45 basis points. These notes have maturities ranging from 2049 through 2067 and will be impacted by the discontinuance of U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates in June 2023. We are currently working to transition these notes to an alternative reference rate. We anticipate that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") will be adopted in accordance with recommendations of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee.\n\nThe average interest rate on the remaining floating-rate senior notes for 2021 and 2020 was 0.00% and 0.40%, respectively. These notes are callable at various times after 30 years at a stated percentage of par value, and redeemable at the option of the note holders at various times after one year at a stated percentage of par value. We have classified these floating-rate senior notes as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, due to our intent and ability to refinance the debt if the put option is exercised.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS SurePost consistently served as a residential ground service for non-urgent, lightweight shipments, with final delivery frequently handled by the U.S. Postal Service. In 2022 and 2023, this arrangement remained unchanged, emphasizing the reliability of the UPS ground network while leveraging USPS for the last mile. However, in 2024, UPS announced a strategic shift to insource the final delivery for UPS SurePost, effective January 1, 2025, aiming to enhance control over service quality and customer experience. This marks a transformation from reliance on a third-party (USPS) to a more integrated and controlled delivery model.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS's treatment of the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan evolved significantly. In 2022, the plan was remeasured following the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, resulting in a pre-tax mark-to-market gain of $3.3 billion ($2.5 billion after tax), which was included in investment income. In 2023, the plan remained a key part of UPS\u2019s pension structure, and the ratification of a new five-year national master agreement with Teamsters employees led to wage and benefit rate increases that were recognized as part of the year-end measurement of the plan. By 2024, the plan was still maintained as a noncontributory defined benefit plan covering employees previously in the Central States Pension Fund and under certain collective bargaining agreements, with no indication of further structural changes, showing UPS's continued commitment to the plan despite broader pension modifications elsewhere. This three-year progression reflects UPS's strategic balance of pension obligations, collective bargaining dynamics, and regulatory responsiveness.",

This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax -qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS'). The plan ceased accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\n- The UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n- The UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n- The UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that ex ceed the benefit limits described above. The plan ceased accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023\n\nRefer to note 6 for the status of our collective bargaining agreements.\n\n## International Pension Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our international employees. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, many of our international employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.\n\nDuring 2022, we amended certain Canadian defined benefit pension plans to cease future benefit accruals effective December 31, 2023. We remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations for the plans, which resulted in curtailment gains of $34 million ($24 million after tax ).

Approximately 18,800 former employees accepted this option, accelerating $820 million in benefit payments during 2019 while reducing the number of participants who are due future payments from U.S. pension plans. As the cost of these settlements did not exceed the plans' service cost and interest cost for the year, the impact of the settlement was not recognized in earnings.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight as discussed in note 4. The divestiture triggered an interim remeasurement of certain UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement medical benefit plans under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715- Compensation- Retirement Benefits ('ASC 715'). Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and benefit obligations of the UPS Pension Plan, UPS Retirement Plan and UPS Retired Employee Health Care Plan as of April 30, 2021.\n\nThe interim remeasurement resulted in an actuarial gain of $2.1 billion. The actuarial gain reflects a $3.7 billion benefit from a 49 basis point increase in the discount rate compared to December 31, 2020 and a $0.1 billion benefit related to workforce reductions associated with the divestiture, offset by a $1.7 billion loss resulting from actual returns being approximately 430 basis points below expected returns. The $2.1 billion actuarial gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. A pre-tax actuarial gain of $69 million ($52 million after tax) was immediately recognized for a prior service credit related to the divested group in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter. We also amended certain benefit terms within these plans as of April 30, 2021. The amendment to the UPS Pension Plan resulted in the immediate recognition of a $66 million ($50 million after tax) loss in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter.\n\nThe impacts of the plan remeasurements and plan amendments are included within Other expenses in the statements of consolidated income as components of the divestiture of UPS Freight.",

In order to estimate NAV, the Company evaluates audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, and makes adjustments, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these subjective assumptions.\n\nAuditing the estimated NAV of these hedge fund, private debt, private equity and real estate investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the completeness, reliability and relevance of the inputs used by management.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the inputs used by management to estimate the NAV of the U.S. Plans' hedge fund, private debt, private equity and real estate investments (collectively, the 'funds') included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers, the relevance of asset class benchmark returns, and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable inputs related to the underlying assets of the funds, including certain controls for which the control design was modified following the transition of the UPS Group Trust's investment management function to Goldman Sachs.\n- For a selection of investments, we evaluated certain inputs and recalculated ending values in accordance with management's processes and confirmed directly with the respective fund manager its preliminary estimate of the fund's NAV as of December 31, 2024.\n- We evaluated the Company's historical ability to accurately estimate NAV for these funds by comparing each fund's recorded valuation as of its prior fiscal year end to the NAV per the audited fund financial statements (which are received in arrears of the Company's reporting timetable).\n\n## Revenue - Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nApproximately 86 percent of the Company's revenues are from its global small package operations that provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. The Company's global small package revenues are comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions sourced from systems that were primarily developed by the Company. The processing of transactions, including the recording of them, is highly automated and based on contractual terms with the Company's customers.\n\nAuditing global small package revenue required a significant extent of effort and the involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (\"IT\") necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications, and automated controls.",

Our global network offers approximately 188,000 entry points where customers can tender packages to us at locations and times convenient to them. This includes UPS drivers who can accept packages, UPS drop boxes, UPS Access Point locations, The UPS Store locations, authorized shipping outlets and commercial counters, alliance locations and customer centers attached to UPS facilities. Our UPS Access Point network includes local small businesses and national retailers. This network allows consumers to ship or redirect packages to an alternate delivery location or to drop off pre-labeled packages, including returns. The UPS Access Point network includes more than 20,000 locations within the U.S. and 52,000 globally.\n\nWe offer a portfolio of returns services in more than 140 countries. These services are driven by the continued growth of ecommerce that has increased our customers' need for efficient and reliable returns, and are designed to promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience. This portfolio provides a range of cost-effective label and digital returns options and a broad network of consumer drop points. We also offer a selection of returns technologies, such as UPS Returns Manager, that promote systems integration, increase customer ease of use and visibility of inbound merchandise. These technologies help reduce costs and improve efficiency in our customers' reverse logistics processes.\n\nOur global air operations are based in Louisville, Kentucky, and are supported by air hubs across the United States and internationally. We operate international air hubs in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Canada and Florida (for Latin America and the Caribbean). This network design enables cost-effective package processing in our most technology-enabled facilities, which allows us to use fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nWe are a leader in time-definite, guaranteed small package delivery services in the United States. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed air and ground package transportation services. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous United States.\n\n- Our air portfolio offers time-definite, same day, next day, two day and three day delivery alternatives.\n- Our ground network enables customers to ship using our day-definite guaranteed ground service. We deliver more ground packages in the U.S. than any other carrier, with average daily package volume of more than 17 million, most within one to three business days.\n- UPS SurePost provides residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. It offers the consistency and reliability of the UPS ground network, with final delivery often provided by the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Latin America and ISMEA. International high-growth markets are one of our identified growth opportunities. We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services, including more guaranteed time-definite express options than any other carrier.\n\nFor international package shipments that do not require express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, guaranteed day-definite service option. For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada, and between the U.S. and Mexico. UPS Worldwide Express Freight is a premium international service for urgent, palletized shipments over 150 pounds.\n\nEurope is our largest region outside of the U.S. and, in 2021, accounted for nearly half of our international package segment revenue. We continue to make major European infrastructure investments to meet growing demand for our services and to improve transit times across the region. Customers can reach more than 80% of Europe's population within two business days using UPS Standard.\n\nWe serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and territories through more than two dozen alliances with local delivery companies that supplement our owned operations.\n\nThe introduction of a direct flight from the U.S. to Dubai has improved time-in-transit to key destinations in ISMEA for shippers throughout the U.S., Canada and Latin America. In India, we are investing in our network to improve transit times and extend pickup times, allowing businesses to gain faster access to markets in Europe and the United States.",

      "question": "How did UPS's time-definite delivery offerings evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of service scope, geographic reach, and operational execution, and what does this progression indicate about the company's strategic focus on guaranteed delivery services?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS emphasized its global small package operations as providing 'time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, packages and palletized freight via air and ground services' across more than 220 countries and territories. By 2023, the company detailed specific time-definite air delivery options including same-day, next-day, two-day, and three-day delivery alternatives in the U.S., while also expanding its returns services in over 140 countries, acquiring Happy Returns to enhance end-to-end returns solutions. In 2024, UPS further refined its time-definite services by insourcing the final delivery of UPS SurePost packages starting January 1, 2025, after previously relying on USPS, and maintained a full spectrum of U.S. domestic air and ground services with continued global reach in approximately 150 countries for returns. This evolution shows a strategic deepening of time-definite delivery capabilities through geographic expansion, service diversification, and operational control improvements.",

In 2024, the total commercial aerospace financing and other commitments stood at $14.1 billion, with Rolls-Royce payments still structured on a per-hour-flown basis through June 2027.

The estimated amount and timing of these payments, which are generally based on future sales or engine flight hours, are reflected in 'Other commercial aerospace commitments' in the table below. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying  economic benefit.  We  have  entered  into  certain  collaboration  arrangements,  which  may  include  participation  by  our  collaboration  partners  in  these commitments. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce's ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V 2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, which are considered in 'Other commercial aerospace commitments' below, will be capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made.\n\nThe following is the expected maturity of our commercial aerospace industry commitments as of December 31, 2024:\n\n",

      "question": "How did RTX's exposure to commercial aerospace customer financing guarantees evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the trend in collaboration partners' share of these guarantees ($142M in 2022, $135M in 2023, and $131M in 2024) indicate about the company's risk management strategy in this domain?",
      "answer": "RTX's exposure to commercial aerospace customer financing guarantees showed a gradual decline in the collaboration partners' share of these guarantees over the three-year period. In 2022, the collaboration partners' share was $142 million, which decreased to $135 million in 2023 and further dropped to $131 million in 2024. This consistent downward trend indicates a strategic reduction in shared financial risk with partners, potentially reflecting a shift in how RTX structures its aerospace financing arrangements or a deliberate move to reduce contingent liabilities. Throughout this period, RTX maintained that the fair market values of the guaranteed assets equaled or exceeded the value of the guarantees net of reserves, suggesting continued confidence in the underlying asset values despite reducing exposure.",

      "answer": "BA's fleet support services costs remained consistently at approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services in 2022, 2023, and 2024, showing no significant change across the three-year period. However, this stable cost ratio contrasts sharply with the company's abnormal production costs and reach-forward losses in the 787 and 777X programs, which grew substantially over the same period. In 2023, the 787 program alone incurred $2.7 billion in cumulative abnormal production costs due to rework and low production rates. In 2024, the 777X program recorded a $2,608 million reach-forward loss in the third quarter and an additional $891 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by certification delays, labor instability, and supplier cost increases. These escalating program-specific costs suggest that while fleet support services remained proportionally stable, BA faced increasing operational and production challenges that significantly impacted financial performance. The persistence of the 1% cost ratio indicates that fleet support services were not the source of the financial strain but rather a consistent expense, underscoring that the company's growing losses were tied to production inefficiencies and program execution risks rather than service delivery.",

In July 2024, we obtained approv al from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. Flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, based on flight test delays and our rev ised assessment of certification timelines, the anticipated first deliv ery of the 7779 was delayed to 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter mov ed to 2028. First deliv ery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. In addition, we decided to slow the production rate ramp of 777X  to address production challenges, which resulted in higher production costs and further customer deliv ery delays. As a result of these changes, as well as higher estimated labor and supplier costs, we recorded a $2,608 million reach-forward loss during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X  program primarily due to higher costs as a result of the new IAM 751 agreement.\n\nWe are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nThe lev el of profitability on the 777X  program will be subject to sev eral factors. T hese factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, deliv ery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X  or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n787 Program T he  accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and deliv ering airplanes. During 2024, we slowed production to below 5 per month due to supply chain constraints as well as other production issues.  While we continue to be impacted by performance challenges and supply chain constraints, we are working  to  increase  production  rates.  Delays  associated  with  business  class  seats  adv ersely  impacted  2024  deliv eries  and  will  continue  to  impact deliv eries in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 25 aircraft in inv entory that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. We expect to complete the rework and deliv er the majority of these aircraft in 2025. T he inspections and rework costs on inv entoried aircraft are accounted for as abnormal production costs, and we expensed $256 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFleet  Support We  prov ide  the  operators  of  our  commercial  aircraft  with  assistance  and  serv ices  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  airplane  operation. Collectiv ely known as fleet support serv ices, these activ ities and serv ices begin prior to airplane deliv ery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. T hey include flight and maintenance training, field serv ice support, engineering serv ices, information serv ices and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and hav e historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and serv ices.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit.

These  impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated  customer considerations.\n\nThe timing of the resumption of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon rework, ongoing customer and supplier  engagement,  production  stability  and  our  activities  with  the  FAA.  China  is  a  significant  market  for  the  787 program, and if the program is unable to obtain additional orders from China in future quarters, we may be required to further  adjust  production  rate  assumptions.  If  we  are  required  to  further  reduce  the  accounting  quantity  and/or production  rates,  experience  further  delivery  delays  or  experience  other  factors  that  result  in  lower  margins,  the program could record additional losses and higher abnormal production costs in future periods.\n\nFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane  delivery  and  continue  throughout  the  operational  life  of  the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  and  technical  data  and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\n\nProgram  Development The  following  chart  summarizes  the  time  horizon  between  go-ahead  and  planned  initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.\n\nReflects models in development during 2021\n\nThe development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements. The timing of certifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X and 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules.  These  challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance  and  reliability  standards  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program  profitability  is  subject  to significant  risks.  Factors  that  could  result  in  lower  margins  (or  a  material  charge  if  an  airplane  program  has  or  is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations.

      "answer": "BA consistently allocated capital to leveraged buyout strategies through private equity investment vehicles across 2022, 2023, and 2024, primarily via limited partnerships (LPs). In 2022, the firm noted that these vehicles may also include publicly traded investments such as REITs for real estate, indicating a broader interpretation of asset access. In 2023 and 2024, the disclosures remained largely consistent in terms of fund structure, continuing to emphasize LPs for both U.S. and non-U.S. strategies, but with no explicit mention of public vehicles in those years. This suggests a narrowing or consolidation of the investment approach, focusing more exclusively on private fund structures by 2023 and 2024.

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing listed 'upgrades and conversions' as one of several services within the Global Services segment, grouped alongside logistics, engineering, and training systems. By 2023, the company maintained a similar structure but began emphasizing 'modifications' more prominently, suggesting a deeper integration of upgrades into broader lifecycle support offerings. In 2024, Boeing continued this pattern but introduced clearer language around 'data analytics and digital services' as complementary to upgrades and conversions, indicating a strategic shift toward technology-enabled service differentiation. This progression shows a growing focus on enhancing aircraft value through modernization rather than just sustaining operations, aligning with a broader transformation toward high-value services.",

BCC's  portfolio  consists  of  equipment  under  operating  leases, sales-type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture.

While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and safety of our employees and maintain business continuity. As COVID-19 vaccines became available, we strongly encouraged employees to get vaccinated when eligible, followed federal and state government vaccination requirements, provided resources and support to help employees get vaccinated, offered paid time off for primary and booster vaccinations, and supported vaccination clinics for our employees and their families. We provided access to virtual  primary  care  physicians  at  no  cost.  We  expanded  our  virtual  work  options  and  many  of  our  office workers continue to telecommute. We have maintained safety protocols at our sites, including face coverings, physical distance requirements and enhanced cleaning requirements. We continue to encourage daily self-health checks and operate our coronavirus hotline, which enables employees to report exposure to COVID-19 and positive COVID-19 test results  directly  to  our  Health  Services  group.  As  part  of  that  reporting  process,  we  have  a  robust  contact  tracing program to identify those who have been in close contact in the workplace with employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. All of the actions above are overseen by Boeing's Crisis Management Working Group, a multi-functional, multi-discipline team tasked with integrating all aspects of Boeing's COVID-19 response.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Boeing's total workforce was approximately 142,000, with 12% located outside of the U.S.\n\n2",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's strategic positioning and operational focus on diesel-electric locomotives evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of product development, segment responsibilities, and integration with broader energy and transportation systems?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar was described as a leading manufacturer of diesel-electric locomotives as part of its broader portfolio of construction and mining equipment, engines, and turbines. By 2023, the company's focus had shifted toward a more integrated approach, with diesel-electric locomotives and rail-related services being positioned under the Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) segment, emphasizing remanufacturing, leasing, and product support. In 2024, Caterpillar expanded its scope further by integrating diesel-electric locomotives into a broader suite of solutions that included electrified powertrains and zero-emission power sources, signaling a strategic pivot toward sustainability and advanced energy systems. This evolution reflects Caterpillar's increasing emphasis on comprehensive rail and energy systems rather than standalone locomotive production.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1. Business.\n\n## General\n\nOriginally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware.  As used herein, the term 'Caterpillar,' 'we,' 'us,' 'our' or 'the company' refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.\n\n## Overview\n\nWith 2021 sales and revenues of $50.971 billion, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.  The company principally operates through its three primary segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy &amp; Transportation - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter.  Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.\n\nCurrently, we have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below.\n\n## Categories of Business Organization\n\n1. Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation - Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\n2. Financial Products - Our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services). Financial Products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\n\nOther information about our operations in 2021, including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Construction Industries\n\nOur Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction.  The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental, quarry and aggregates markets and mining.\n\nThe nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world.  Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine. To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines.  We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development spending in 2021 focused on the next generation of construction machines.\n\nThe competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include CASE (part of CNH Industrial N.V.), Deere Construction &amp; Forestry (part of Deere &amp; Company), Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd., Hyundai Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. and Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd. (both part of Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co.), J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Kobelco Construction Machinery (part of Kobe Steel, Ltd), Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Farm &amp; Industrial Machinery (part of Kubota Corporation), and Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XCMG Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (SDLG, part of the Volvo Group) and Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., (part of Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co.). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Caterpillar's EMD-branded products were distributed across 193 countries in 2022, then slightly declined to 191 countries in 2023, and further decreased to 187 countries by 2024. This gradual reduction in geographic reach suggests a potential strategic refocusing or consolidation in Caterpillar\u2019s global distribution strategy for EMD products, possibly due to market-specific challenges, competitive pressures, or internal restructuring.",

Nature of operations\n\nInformation in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:\n\nMachinery, Energy &amp; Transportation (ME&amp;T) - We define ME&amp;T as Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. ME&amp;T's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\n\nFinancial  Products -  We  define  Financial  Products  as  our  finance  and  insurance  subsidiaries,  primarily  Caterpillar Financial  Services  Corporation  (Cat  Financial)  and  Caterpillar  Insurance  Holdings  Inc.  (Insurance  Services).  Financial Products' information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\n\nWe sell our products primarily under the brands 'Caterpillar,' 'CAT,' design versions of 'CAT' and 'Caterpillar,' 'EMD,' 'FG Wilson,' 'MaK,' 'MWM,' 'Perkins,' 'Progress Rail,' 'SEM' and 'Solar Turbines.'\n\nWe conduct operations in our ME&amp;T line of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers' service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\n\nWe distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 44 located in the United States and 116 located outside the United States, serving 193 countries.  We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 90 distributors covering 171 countries. We sell the FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems through its worldwide network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries.  We also sell some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers' principal business. We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives,  to  end  customers  through  sales  forces  employed  by  the  company. At  times,  these  employees  are  assisted  by independent sales representatives.\n\nThe Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar  products  is  available  through  a  variety  of  competitive  sources,  principally  commercial  banks  and  finance  and leasing  companies.  We  offer  various  financing,  insurance  and  risk  management  products  designed  to  support  sales  of  our products and generate financing income for our company. We conduct a significant portion of Financial Products activity in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n## B. Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.\n\nInvestments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nWe consolidate  all  variable  interest  entities  (VIEs)  where  Caterpillar  Inc.  is  the  primary  beneficiary.    For  VIEs,  we  assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs.  The primary beneficiary  of  a VIE  is  the  party  that  has  both  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Caterpillar consistently highlighted its exposure to currency exchange rate risk due to its global operations, emphasizing the use of currency hedging instruments as a key strategy to mitigate adverse fluctuations. In 2022, CAT noted that while hedging instruments could protect against downside risks, they also limited potential upside from favorable currency movements. By 2023, the company expanded its discussion to include risks from exchange controls and currency devaluations, particularly in emerging markets, indicating a growing concern over geopolitical and macroeconomic volatility affecting its foreign subsidiaries. In 2024, Caterpillar reiterated its reliance on hedging strategies but also underscored the limitations of these instruments in the face of unpredictable global currency dynamics, especially as exchange controls and devaluation risks intensified. The multi-year trend reveals a consistent but increasingly cautious approach to managing currency exposure, with rising emphasis on external macroeconomic pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.\n\nChanges in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.  LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.  On November 18, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\"), the administrator of USD LIBOR, announced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, IBA, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While the November 30 announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established if LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or alternative reference rates to be established.  The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has created a cross-functional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial's borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.  With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.\n\n## An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\n\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis. However, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.\n\n## Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\n\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  We are subject to currency-exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.",

Changes in market interest rates may influence its and our borrowing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made utilizing fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use floating reference rates or indices, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.\n\nCat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.\n\n## An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\n\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the ex perience and ex pertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis. However, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.\n\n## Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\n\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  We are subject to currency-exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars.  There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of  operations, financial condition and cash flows.  While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\n\n## Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\n\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt  securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including  Cat  Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and sales and leaseback transactions, restrictions on the transfer of certain property and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements",

      "question": "How did BA's allocation to private equity investment vehicles evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's long-term alternative investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BA described its private equity investment vehicles as primarily limited partnerships focused on leveraged buyout, venture capital, growth, and special situation strategies. In 2023, BA reiterated this focus while also emphasizing the use of derivatives by investment managers to achieve desired market exposure. By 2024, BA maintained the same core strategy but expanded the description to include more explicit authorization for derivatives such as equity or bond futures, swaps, and options, indicating a more active management approach. The consistent emphasis on private equity vehicles across all three years, combined with increasing sophistication in risk management tools, suggests a strategic commitment to alternative investments with evolving implementation tactics.",

However, the 787 program's abnormal production costs and delivery delays significantly evolved during this period. In 2022, the company noted ongoing delivery delays and potential future losses due to rework and production instability, with no specific abnormal cost figures disclosed. In 2023, Boeing revealed cumulative abnormal production costs of $2.7 billion through December 31, 2023, primarily related to rework on inventoried aircraft, with expectations that remaining rework costs would not be significant. By 2024, the company had completed rework on most of the 25 inventoried aircraft produced prior to 2023 and expensed $256 million in rework costs during the year, with expectations to deliver the majority of these aircraft in 2025. This progression indicates a reduction in abnormal costs and a gradual resolution of delivery delays, though the program continued to face production and certification challenges.",

These  impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated  customer considerations.\n\nThe timing of the resumption of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon rework, ongoing customer and supplier  engagement,  production  stability  and  our  activities  with  the  FAA.  China  is  a  significant  market  for  the  787 program, and if the program is unable to obtain additional orders from China in future quarters, we may be required to further  adjust  production  rate  assumptions.  If  we  are  required  to  further  reduce  the  accounting  quantity  and/or production  rates,  experience  further  delivery  delays  or  experience  other  factors  that  result  in  lower  margins,  the program could record additional losses and higher abnormal production costs in future periods.\n\nFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane  delivery  and  continue  throughout  the  operational  life  of  the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  and  technical  data  and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\n\nProgram  Development The  following  chart  summarizes  the  time  horizon  between  go-ahead  and  planned  initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.\n\nReflects models in development during 2021\n\nThe development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements. The timing of certifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X and 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules.  These  challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance  and  reliability  standards  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program  profitability  is  subject  to significant  risks.  Factors  that  could  result  in  lower  margins  (or  a  material  charge  if  an  airplane  program  has  or  is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe are currently targeting a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777X  programs hav ing resumed production in December 2024. In July 2024, we obtained approv al from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. Flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, based on flight test delays and our rev ised assessment of certification timelines, the anticipated first deliv ery of the 7779 was delayed to 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter mov ed to 2028. First deliv ery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. In addition, we decided to slow the production rate ramp of 777X  to address production challenges, which resulted in higher production costs and further customer deliv ery delays. As a result of these changes, as well as higher estimated labor and supplier costs, we recorded a $2,608 million reach-forward loss during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X  program primarily due to higher costs as a result of the new IAM 751 agreement.\n\nWe are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nThe lev el of profitability on the 777X  program will be subject to sev eral factors. T hese factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, deliv ery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X  or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n787 Program T he  accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and deliv ering airplanes. During 2024, we slowed production to below 5 per month due to supply chain constraints as well as other production issues.  While we continue to be impacted by performance challenges and supply chain constraints, we are working  to  increase  production  rates.  Delays  associated  with  business  class  seats  adv ersely  impacted  2024  deliv eries  and  will  continue  to  impact deliv eries in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 25 aircraft in inv entory that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. We expect to complete the rework and deliv er the majority of these aircraft in 2025. T he inspections and rework costs on inv entoried aircraft are accounted for as abnormal production costs, and we expensed $256 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFleet  Support We  prov ide  the  operators  of  our  commercial  aircraft  with  assistance  and  serv ices  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  airplane  operation. Collectiv ely known as fleet support serv ices, these activ ities and serv ices begin prior to airplane deliv ery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. T hey include flight and maintenance training, field serv ice support, engineering serv ices, information serv ices and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and hav e historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and serv ices.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit.

      "answer": "BA's characterization of private equity investments in special situation strategies remained consistent across the 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings. In each year, the company described its private equity investment vehicles as primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital, growth, and special situation strategies. The repeated inclusion of 'special situation strategies' alongside similar categories like leveraged buyout and venture capital across all three years suggests a deliberate and sustained focus on alternative investments that capitalize on unique market opportunities, such as restructuring, distressed assets, or event-driven scenarios. This consistency indicates that BA views special situation strategies as a core component of its long-term private equity allocation, rather than a tactical or opportunistic shift.",

BGS  sustains  aerospace platforms and systems with a full spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and conversions, spare parts, pilot and maintenance training systems and services, technical and maintenance documents, and data analytics and digital services.\n\n## Boeing Capital Segment\n\nBCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product,  while  managing  overall  financing  exposure.  BCC's  portfolio  consists  of  equipment  under  operating  leases, sales-type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and  from  third  parties.  For  example,  the  U.S.  government  has  licenses  in  our  patents  that  are  developed  in performance  of  government  contracts,  and  it  may  use  or  authorize  others  to  use  the  inventions  covered  by  such patents  for  government  purposes.  Unpatented  research,  development  and  engineering  skills,  as  well  as  certain trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and safety of our employees and maintain business continuity. As COVID-19 vaccines became available, we strongly encouraged employees to get vaccinated when eligible, followed federal and state government vaccination requirements, provided resources and support to help employees get vaccinated, offered paid time off for primary and booster vaccinations, and supported vaccination clinics for our employees and their families. We provided access to virtual  primary  care  physicians  at  no  cost.  We  expanded  our  virtual  work  options  and  many  of  our  office workers continue to telecommute. We have maintained safety protocols at our sites, including face coverings, physical distance requirements and enhanced cleaning requirements. We continue to encourage daily self-health checks and operate our coronavirus hotline, which enables employees to report exposure to COVID-19 and positive COVID-19 test results  directly  to  our  Health  Services  group.  As  part  of  that  reporting  process,  we  have  a  robust  contact  tracing program to identify those who have been in close contact in the workplace with employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. All of the actions above are overseen by Boeing's Crisis Management Working Group, a multi-functional, multi-discipline team tasked with integrating all aspects of Boeing's COVID-19 response.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Boeing's total workforce was approximately 142,000, with 12% located outside of the U.S.\n\n2",

      "answer": "Union Pacific's allocation to Collective Trust and Other Funds decreased from $756 million in 2022 to $382 million in 2023, and remained categorized under NAV-based valuation in 2024. This represents a 49.5% reduction over one year, suggesting a strategic shift toward more transparent and actively managed investments, possibly to enhance liquidity and reduce reliance on less transparent structures.",

T he following is a description of the v aluation methodologies used for the inv estments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the v aluation hierarchy.\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Gov ernment Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the  U.S.  T reasury  or  by  gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises.  T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using NAV for each inv estment.",

      "question": "How did the valuation classification and allocation of UNP's Corporate Stock investments evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's pension strategy and market exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UNP's Corporate Stock investment was valued at $1,990 million, with $1,980 million classified under Level 1 (Quoted Prices in Active Markets) and $10 million under Level 2 (Significant Other Observable Inputs). By 2023, the total Corporate Stock investment dropped significantly to $181 million, with $176 million in Level 1 and $5 million in Level 2. In 2024, the company continued to hold Corporate Stock, with common stock classified as Level 1 and preferred stock as Level 2, though no updated dollar figures were provided in the disclosure. This sharp decline from 2022 to 2023 suggests a major reallocation or divestiture in Corporate Stock, potentially signaling a strategic shift toward more stable or diversified pension investments, while the 2024 classification reaffirms the continued use of observable market data for valuation.",

T he following is a description of the v aluation methodologies used for the inv estments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the v aluation hierarchy.\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Gov ernment Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the  U.S.  T reasury  or  by  gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises.  T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using NAV for each inv estment.",

      "answer": "Union Pacific's reliance on leased freight cars increased significantly from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, the company noted rising freight car rent expenses due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity, indicating growing dependence on leased assets. By 2023, the company explicitly listed freight cars among the leased assets used in operations, signaling a formalization of this reliance. In 2024, the data revealed a total of 22,472 leased freight cars across all categories, representing nearly 40% of the total freight car fleet (56,176 total units). This 3-year trend suggests a strategic shift toward greater operational flexibility by leveraging leased assets rather than increasing owned rolling stock, likely to better match capacity with demand fluctuations and manage capital expenditures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses increased $767 million in 2021 compared to  2020  driven  by  higher  fuel  prices,  volume-related  costs, inflation,  higher  casualty  costs,  2020  management  actions, weather and wildfire-related expenses, incentive compensation,  and  higher  state  and  local  taxes.  Partially offsetting  these  increases  compared  to  2020  include  a  $278 million  impairment  charge  in  2020,  productivity  initiatives,  a one-time  bonus  payment  for  agreement  employees  in  2020, and lower severance costs. Full year results of 2021 and 2020 both include a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n2021 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits -  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension  costs,  and  incentive  costs.  In  2021,  expenses  increased  4%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  volume  related costs,  inflation,  2020  management  actions  responding  to  the  sharp  decline  in  volume  (temporary  unpaid  leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\n\nDepreciation -  The  majority  of  depreciation  relates  to  road  property,  including  rail,  ties,  ballast,  and  other  track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nFuel -  Fuel  includes  locomotive  fuel  and  gasoline  for  highway  and  non-highway  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared  to  $1.50  per  gallon  in  2020,  increased  expenses  $668  million  (excluding  any  impact  from  increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased  from  outside  contractors  and  other  service  providers  (including  equipment  maintenance  and  contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad's lines, structures, and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile  maintenance  expenses;  and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  services  and  materials  increased  3%  in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with  our  intermodal  business,  higher  costs  due  to  weather  and  wildfire-related  events,  increased  locomotive  and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\n\nEquipment  and  Other  Rents -  Equipment  and  other  rents  expense  primarily  includes  rental  expense  that  the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;  and  office  and  other  rent  expenses,  offset  by  equity  income  from  certain  equity  method  investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and  higher  equity  income  from  our  investment  in  TTX  Company,  partially  offset  by  increased  freight  car  rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\n\nOther - Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal  injury,  environmental,  employee  travel,  telephone  and  cellular,  computer  software,  bad  debt,  and  other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million noncash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital  projects,  2020  lease  impairments,  and  higher  equity  income.  Partially  offsetting  these  decreases  were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local  taxes.  Both  periods  in  2021  and  2020  included  a  reduction  of  expense  for  weather  and  wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

      "question": "How did Emerson's (EMR) positioning and strategic emphasis on pipe wrenches evolve across its Tools & Home Products and Safety & Productivity segments from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's focus on professional tool markets?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Emerson consistently positioned pipe wrenches as a core component of its professional tools portfolio, but the strategic framing evolved alongside segment rebranding and integration. In 2022, pipe wrenches were highlighted under the 'Tools & Home Products' segment, specifically as part of the professional tools category used by plumbing and mechanical professionals. By 2023 and 2024, the same product line was integrated into the broader 'Safety & Productivity' segment, reflecting a shift toward framing pipe wrenches within the context of infrastructure support, safety, and productivity for professionals. This evolution indicates a strategic consolidation of professional tools under a value proposition emphasizing safety and industrial efficiency, rather than standalone tool functionality.",

In 2024, Caterpillar explicitly linked its diesel-electric locomotive business to broader electrification efforts, mentioning 'electrified powertrain and zero-emission power sources and service solutions development' alongside diesel-electric locomotives, indicating a strategic pivot toward sustainable technologies while maintaining its traditional offerings. This evolution reflects Caterpillar's increasing emphasis on transitioning toward low- and zero-emission solutions within its rail segment.",

Business.\n\n## General\n\nOriginally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware.  As used herein, the term 'Caterpillar,' 'we,' 'us,' 'our' or 'the company' refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.\n\n## Overview\n\nWith 2021 sales and revenues of $50.971 billion, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.  The company principally operates through its three primary segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy &amp; Transportation - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter.  Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.\n\nCurrently, we have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below.\n\n## Categories of Business Organization\n\n1. Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation - Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\n2. Financial Products - Our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services). Financial Products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\n\nOther information about our operations in 2021, including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Construction Industries\n\nOur Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction.  The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental, quarry and aggregates markets and mining.\n\nThe nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world.  Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine. To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines.  We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development spending in 2021 focused on the next generation of construction machines.\n\nThe competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include CASE (part of CNH Industrial N.V.), Deere Construction &amp; Forestry (part of Deere &amp; Company), Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd., Hyundai Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. and Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd. (both part of Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co.), J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Kobelco Construction Machinery (part of Kobe Steel, Ltd), Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Farm &amp; Industrial Machinery (part of Kubota Corporation), and Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XCMG Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (SDLG, part of the Volvo Group) and Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., (part of Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co.). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.",

ME&amp;T's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\n\nFinancial  Products -  We  define  Financial  Products  as  our  finance  and  insurance  subsidiaries,  primarily  Caterpillar  Financial  Services  Corporation  (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services). Financial Products' information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\n\nWe sell our products primarily under the brands 'Caterpillar,' 'CAT,' design versions of 'CAT' and 'Caterpillar,' 'EMD,' 'FG  Wilson,' 'MWM,' 'Perkins,' 'Progress Rail,' 'SEM' and 'Solar Turbines.'\n\nWe conduct operations in our ME&amp;T line of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers' service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\n\nWe distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 41 located in the United States and 111 located outside the United States, serving 187 countries.  We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 88 distributors covering 185  countries. We sell  the  FG   Wilson  branded  electric  power  generation  systems  through  its  worldwide  network  of 108  distributors  covering 158 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers' principal business. We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.\n\nThe Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.  We offer various financing, insurance and risk management products designed to support sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. We conduct a significant portion of Financial Products activity in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Africa.\n\n## B. Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.\n\nInvestments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nWe consolidate all variable interest entities (V IEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a V IE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the V IE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.\n\nCat Financial has end-user customers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. Credit risk was evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses.",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's exposure to and management of currency hedging instruments evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in response to the transition from LIBOR to SOFR and the associated risks outlined in each year's disclosures?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Caterpillar maintained a consistent reliance on currency hedging instruments to manage exchange rate risk, while adapting to the transition from LIBOR to SOFR in its broader interest rate risk management strategy. In 2022, the company was actively assessing the implications of the planned phase-out of LIBOR, noting that Cat Financial had formed a cross-functional team to evaluate risks associated with the use of LIBOR in derivatives, loans, and other financial instruments. By 2023, this focus had evolved to include SOFR as the new benchmark for variable interest rates, with Cat Financial managing interest rate exposure through match funding, selective derivatives, and diversified funding. In 2024, the company continued to emphasize the use of derivatives as part of its hedging strategy, with no significant changes in approach but ongoing acknowledgment of the risks posed by market liquidity and interest rate fluctuations. The consistent use of hedging instruments across all three years shows Caterpillar's strategic effort to mitigate currency risk, even as the broader financial landscape shifted from LIBOR to SOFR.",

Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made utilizing fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use floating reference rates or indices, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.\n\nCat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.\n\n## An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\n\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the ex perience and ex pertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis. However, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.\n\n## Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\n\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  We are subject to currency-exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars.  There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of  operations, financial condition and cash flows.  While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\n\n## Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\n\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt  securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including  Cat  Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and sales and leaseback transactions, restrictions on the transfer of certain property and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements",

Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.  LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.  On November 18, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\"), the administrator of USD LIBOR, announced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, IBA, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While the November 30 announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established if LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or alternative reference rates to be established.  The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has created a cross-functional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial's borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts.

      "question": "How did RTX's liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's exposure and risk management in commercial aerospace contracts?",
      "answer": "RTX's liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees remained relatively stable across the three-year period. In 2022, the collaboration partners' share of financing guarantees was $140 million, which slightly decreased to $135 million in 2023, and further declined to $131 million in 2024. These figures indicate a gradual reduction in RTX\u2019s shared liability exposure with partners, suggesting improved risk management or renegotiation of terms in aerospace financing arrangements over time. The company consistently accrues for these guarantees based on historical performance data and adjusts as new claims data emerges, showing a disciplined and evolving approach to managing long-term obligations tied to product performance.",

      "question": "How did RTX's financial obligations to Rolls-Royce evolve from 2022 through 2024 under their 2012 agreement related to International Aero Engines AG, particularly in terms of contingent flight-hour payments and capitalization as collaboration assets?",
      "answer": "RTX's contingent financial obligations to Rolls-Royce under the 2012 agreement related to IAE remained consistent in structure across the three years\u2014tying payments to flight hours flown by V2500-powered aircraft through June 2027. In 2022, these payments were described as being capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments were made. By 2023, the company clarified that these payments were being amortized to cost of sales, indicating a more detailed accounting treatment. In 2024, the payments were further integrated into RTX's broader commercial aerospace commitments, with a specific mention of their inclusion in 'Other commercial aerospace commitments' and a detailed note on how they are capitalized and amortized over the economic benefit period. This evolution reflects a growing maturity in how RTX accounts for and discloses these long-standing contingent liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [RTX](2023) \u2192 [Rolls-Royce]: In 2023, RTX disclosed that contingent payments to Rolls-Royce under the 2012 IAE agreement were being capitalized as collaboration assets and amortized to cost of sales, reflecting a more mature accounting treatment.",
        "Hop 2: [RTX](2024) \u2192 [Rolls-Royce]: In 2024, the contingent flight-hour payments were explicitly included in 'Other commercial aerospace commitments' and described as being capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made, with clearer linkage to amortization schedules and financial reporting.",
        "Hop 3: [RTX](2022) \u2192 [Rolls-Royce]: In 2022, RTX referenced the same contingent payments to Rolls-Royce tied to V2500 flight hours through 2027, but the treatment was more general, stating only that payments were capitalized as collaboration assets as made, without specifying amortization to cost of sales."

Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction  over  our  foreign  operations.  We  have  accrued  for  the  costs  of  environmental  remediation  activities,  including  but  not  limited  to  investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs, and performance guarantees, and periodically reassess these amounts. We do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $0.8 billion reserved for environmental remediation. Additional information pertaining to environmental matters is included in 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.'\n\nCommercial  Aerospace  Financing  and  Other  Commitments. We  had  commercial  aerospace  financing  commitments  and  other  contractual  commitments  of approximately $14.1 billion and $14.6 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners' share. Aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, are provided to certain commercial aerospace customers. The extent to which the financing commitments will be utilized is not currently known, since customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from other financing sources. We may also arrange for third-party investors to assume a portion of these commitments. The majority of financing commitments are collateralized arrangements. We may also lease aircraft and  subsequently  sublease  the  aircraft  to  customers  under  long-term  non-cancelable  operating  leases,  or  pay  deposits  on  behalf  of  our  customers  to  secure production  slots  with  the  airframers  (pre-delivery  payments).  Our  financing  commitments  with  customers  are  contingent  upon  maintenance  of  certain  levels  of financial condition by our customers. Associated risks on these commitments are mitigated due to the fact that interest rates are variable during the commitment term and are set at the date of funding based on current market conditions, the fair value of the underlying collateral, and the credit worthiness of our customers. As a result, the fair value of these financing commitments is ex pected to equal the amounts funded.\n\nWe also have other contractual commitments to make payments to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. The estimated amount and timing of these payments, which are generally based on future sales or engine flight hours, are reflected in 'Other commercial aerospace commitments' in the table below. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying  economic benefit.  We  have  entered  into  certain  collaboration  arrangements,  which  may  include  participation  by  our  collaboration  partners  in  these commitments. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce's ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V 2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, which are considered in 'Other commercial aerospace commitments' below, will be capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made.\n\nThe following is the expected maturity of our commercial aerospace industry commitments as of December 31, 2024:\n\n",

This consistent reduction suggests a strategic shift toward reducing RTX's reliance on third-party risk sharing in these financing arrangements, potentially signaling increased internal risk retention or tighter control over financing terms.

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's production focus on the VH-92A Helicopter evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression indicate about the program's strategic importance within the Rotary and Mission Systems segment?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the VH-92A Helicopter remained a consistent part of Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) portfolio, indicating sustained strategic importance. In 2022, RMS highlighted the VH-92A as part of its major programs, alongside other key platforms like the Black Hawk and CH-53K. In 2023, the VH-92A was again listed among RMS's major helicopter programs, reinforcing its ongoing production and support status. By 2024, the VH-92A continued to be a named program within RMS, even as the segment saw increased focus on other platforms and systems such as Aegis and LCS. The consistent mention of the VH-92A across all three years suggests a stable, long-term commitment to the program, despite shifting priorities and production ramps in other areas like missile defense and tactical systems.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [LMT](2023) \u2192 [VH-92A Helicopter]: The VH-92A is listed among RMS's major helicopter programs, including BLACK HAWK, Seahawk, and CH-53K, indicating ongoing production and support.",
        "Hop 2: [LMT](2024) \u2192 [VH-92A Helicopter]: The VH-92A remains a named program within RMS, even as the segment experiences production ramp-ups in other areas like PAC-3, JASSM, and GMLRS.",
        "Hop 3: [LMT](2022) \u2192 [VH-92A Helicopter]: The VH-92A is included in RMS's major programs list, showing it was already an established part of the portfolio with no indication of imminent phase-out."

The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $340 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher volume and risk retirements (primarily PAC-3); and about $215 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM). These increases  were  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  of  approximately  $90  million  for  sensors  and  global  sustainment programs due to lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache)  that  was  partially  offset  by  close  out  activities  related  to  the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (Warrior) that was terminated by the customer in March 2021. \u00ae\n\nMFC's operating profit in 2021 increased $103 million, or 7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $65 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher risk retirements and volume (primarily PAC-3); about $45 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM) and higher risk retirements (primarily GMLRS); and approximately $20 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to the reversal of a portion of previously recorded losses on the Warrior program in the second and third quarters of 2021 that will not recur as a result of the program being terminated, which was partially offset by lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache). These increases were partially offset by charges of approximately $25 million due to performance issues on an energy program during the third quarter of 2021. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $85 million higher in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3 and air dominance programs.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect MFC's 2022 net sales to decrease in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by volume on SOF GLSS and funding on a classified program. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the low-single digit range below 2021 levels.

      "question": "How did LMT's use of variable interest rate swaps evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the progression in the notional amounts of these swaps reveal about the company's interest rate risk management strategy over time?",
      "answer": "LMT's use of variable interest rate swaps increased significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the notional amount of interest rate swaps was $500 million, rising to $1.3 billion by 2023, and remaining at $1.3 billion in 2024. This tripling of exposure indicates a strategic shift toward more active interest rate risk management, particularly in hedging fixed-rate borrowings against potential rate fluctuations. The consistency in the notional amount from 2023 to 2024 suggests that LMT stabilized its hedging position after the initial increase, likely reflecting a recalibrated and matured risk management approach.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\n\nOur main exposures to market risk relate to interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fix ed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $20.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and the outstanding principal amount of debt, including short-term and long-term debt, was $21.6 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.3 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.  We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fix ed  rate  borrowings,  we  may  use  variable  interest  rate  swaps,  effectively  converting  fix ed  rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to minimize certain economic exposures.\n\nThe classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.5 billion and $6.5 billion. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see 'Note 15 - Fair V alue Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter  into  foreign  currency  contracts  to  hedge  foreign  currency  ex posure  on  underlying  transactions,  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across many banks. We regularly monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2024, investments in the trust totaled $1.8 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fix ed-income securities that are ex posed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lockheed Martin's production and strategic emphasis on Advanced Technology Systems intensified, marked by increased investment in internal R&D, expansion of key programs like hypersonics and classified development, and a growing international footprint. In 2022, the company emphasized affordability and disciplined domestic portfolio growth, while accelerating supplier payments by $2.2 billion to mitigate pandemic-related disruptions. By 2023, LMT highlighted growth in programs such as PAC-3 production, HIMARS/GMLRS demand, and hypersonics programs expected to enter production by 2026, with a stronger focus on integrating advanced networking and open-architecture systems under its 21st Century Security vision. In 2024, the company maintained its strategic direction but showed signs of financial discipline and risk mitigation through its contract accounting practices and performance guarantees, with $708 million in expected standby letter renewals and $351 million in third-party guarantees, indicating sustained investment in complex, long-term defense contracts involving Advanced Technology Systems. This trajectory reveals a shift from pandemic recovery and affordability focus in 2022 to scaling high-priority defense technologies and international expansion by 2024.",

(a)\n\nAt December 31, 2024, third-party guarantees totaled $351 million, of which approximately 30% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. G enerally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently  available  information  and  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances. Actual  results  could  differ  from  our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. G overnment and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the  products  and  services.  Substantially  all  of  our  revenue  is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations in which control transfers continuously to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage of completion cost-to-cost measure of progress.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. We also estimate variable",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  included  in  Item  8  -  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nThe MD&amp;A generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019  items  and  year-to-year  comparisons  between  2020  and  2019  that  are  not  included  in  this  Form  10-K  can  be  found  in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations' in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nWe  are  a  global  security  and  aerospace  company  principally  engaged  in  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering,  technical,  scientific,  logistics,  system  integration  and  cybersecurity  services.  We  serve  both  U.S.  and  international customers with products and services that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal  customers  being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2021, 71% of our $67.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 62% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\n\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S.  and  international  customers  at  affordable  prices.  Recognizing  that  our  customers  are  resource  constrained,  we  place considerable focus on affordability initiatives while endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner,  with  a  focus  on  adjacent  markets  close  to  our  core  capabilities  as  well  as  growing  our  international  sales.  We  invest substantially  in  our  people  to  ensure  we  have  the  technical  skills  necessary  to  succeed,  and  we  expect  to  continue  to  invest internally on innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We will continue to invest  in  acquisitions,  as  appropriate,  while  deepening  our  connection  to  commercial  industry  through  cooperative  partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to present business challenges in 2021. We experienced impacts in each of our business areas  related  to  COVID-19,  primarily  in  continued  increased  coronavirus-related  costs,  delays  in  supplier  deliveries,  travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, employee absences, remote work and adjusted work schedules. During the first half  of  2021,  we  had  initiated  a  plan  to  reintroduce  employees  that  had  been  working  remotely  to  the  workplace,  however,  we paused the reintroduction as COVID-19 cases rose in the second half of 2021. Attendance for employees required to be onsite has fluctuated based on pandemic developments. We continued to take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, including  encouraging  employees  to  be  vaccinated.  We  also  continued  to  work  with  our  customers  and  suppliers  to  minimize disruptions, including using accelerated progress payments from the U.S. Government and cash on hand to accelerate $2.2 billion of payments to our suppliers as of December 31, 2021 that are due by their terms in future periods. We will continue to monitor risk driven by the pandemic and, based on our current assessment, we expect to continue to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk  assessed  need  through  the  end  of  2022.  Consistent  with  our  current  acceleration  approach,  we  will  prioritize  small  and COVID-19 impacted businesses.\n\nWe  are  closely  tracking  developments  regarding  vaccine  mandates.  Currently,  all  personnel  working  at  DoD  facilities, including  Lockheed  Martin  employees,  must  comply  with  DoD's  process  to  attest  to  vaccination  status.  Pursuant  to  the  DoD mandate,  this  is  required  for  physical  access  to  DoD  buildings  and  leased  spaces  in  non-DoD  buildings  where  official  agency business is performed. Additionally, until it was enjoined by a federal court in December 2021, pursuant to Executive Order 14042, referred  to  as  the  federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate,  all  U.S.  based  employees  of  Lockheed  Martin  and  most  of  its  suppliers, industry partners and contractors working directly or indirectly on covered government contracts, or working at a facility where those contracts are performed, administered, or otherwise supported, were to be fully vaccinated, or have an",

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's pension risk transfer transactions evolve from 2022 through 2024 in terms of pension obligation amounts transferred, and what does this trend indicate about the company's long-term liability management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that since December 2018, it had transferred approximately $11.6 billion in pension obligations through risk transfer transactions, eliminating PBGC premiums of $69 million annually. In 2023, the company announced its continued evaluation of such transactions, indicating ongoing strategic interest in mitigating pension risk. By 2024, Lockheed Martin reaffirmed its intent to pursue additional pension risk transfer transactions, signaling a consistent and sustained strategy to reduce defined benefit pension liabilities and associated volatility. The trajectory from a cumulative $11.6 billion in 2022 to an ongoing commitment in 2024 suggests a deliberate, multi-year liability management approach.",

All of the estimates require significant judgement and are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident, which we refer to as a reach-forward loss.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution  of  contractual  matters,  cost  recoveries  on  severance  and  restructuring,  insurance  recoveries  and  gains  on  sales  of  assets. Unfavorable  items  may  include  the  adverse  resolution  of  contractual  matters,  supply  chain  disruptions,  restructuring  charges  (ex cept  for  significant  severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nFor the impacts of changes in estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. G overnment. Costbased pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S.  G overnment  contracts.  For  ex ample,  costs  such  as  those  related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  ex pense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For ex ample, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract  accounting.  Costs  incurred  and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. G overnment regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\n\n## Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Overview\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see 'Note 11 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in a defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nWe continue to take  actions  to  reduce  the  size  of  our  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  From  December  2018,  through  our  master  retirement  trust,  we  have transferred outstanding defined benefit pension obligations to third party insurance companies; reducing annually required Pension Benefit G uarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional pension risk transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity, as well as the timing of cash funding.",

The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nSimilar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. On August 3, 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The GACs were purchased using  assets  from  Lockheed  Martin's  master  retirement  trust  and  no  additional  funding  contribution  was  required  by  us.  This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans during the third quarter of 2021, which represents the accelerated  recognition  of  actuarial  losses  that  were  included  in  the  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  account  within stockholders' equity. As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets for the affected  defined  benefit  pension  plans  as  of  the  August  3,  2021  close  date.  The  purchase  of  the  GACs  and  the  pension remeasurement did not have an impact on our CAS pension cost and did not significantly impact our total FAS pension expense or net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021, except for the noncash pension settlement charge.\n\nInclusive of the transaction described above, since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $11.6 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension  plan  volatility  for  approximately  95,000  retirees  and  beneficiaries  and  annually  required  Pension  Benefit  Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $69 million per year.\n\nWe expect  to  continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  manage  our  pension  liabilities  through  additional  pension  risk  transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding  these  actions,  the  impact  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plans  on  our  earnings  may  be  volatile  in  that  the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.\n\n## Actuarial Assumptions\n\nThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, and employee turnover.  The  assumptions  we  make  affect  both  the  calculation  of  the  benefit  obligations  as  of  the  measurement  date  and  the calculation  of  FAS  expense  in  subsequent  periods.  When  reassessing  these  assumptions,  we  consider  past  and  current  market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\n\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 2.875% at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.50% at December 31, 2020. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 2.75% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our",

      "question": "How did RTX's liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's exposure to long-term product performance risks in its commercial aerospace business?",
      "answer": "RTX's liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees remained relatively stable from 2022 to 2024, with the collaboration partners' share of financing guarantees decreasing slightly from $141 million in 2022 to $135 million in 2023, and further to $131 million in 2024. The company's own liabilities related to these guarantees were not explicitly stated, but the consistent methodology of estimating based on historical experience and adjusting as claims data warrant suggests a managed but ongoing exposure. The trend indicates that RTX continues to extend these guarantees, particularly for commercial aircraft engines, while maintaining a controlled liability posture, suggesting stable long-term product performance expectations despite market uncertainties.",

Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction  over  our  foreign  operations.  We  have  accrued  for  the  costs  of  environmental  remediation  activities,  including  but  not  limited  to  investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs, and performance guarantees, and periodically reassess these amounts. We do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $0.8 billion reserved for environmental remediation. Additional information pertaining to environmental matters is included in 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.'\n\nCommercial  Aerospace  Financing  and  Other  Commitments. We  had  commercial  aerospace  financing  commitments  and  other  contractual  commitments  of approximately $14.1 billion and $14.6 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners' share. Aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, are provided to certain commercial aerospace customers. The extent to which the financing commitments will be utilized is not currently known, since customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from other financing sources. We may also arrange for third-party investors to assume a portion of these commitments. The majority of financing commitments are collateralized arrangements.

      "answer": "RTX's exposure to commercial aerospace customer financing guarantees saw a gradual decline in the collaboration partners' share over the three-year period, decreasing from $142 million in 2022 to $135 million in 2023, and further to $131 million in 2024. This indicates a consistent reduction in the portion of financing guarantees shared with partners, potentially signaling a strategic shift where RTX assumed more direct financial risk or altered its partnership structures. Despite this, RTX maintained that the fair market values of the guaranteed assets equaled or exceeded the guarantees net of reserves, suggesting continued confidence in the underlying asset values supporting these financing arrangements.",

However, this production growth was accompanied by deteriorating operating profit performance. In 2022, operating profit benefited from higher volume and risk retirements. In 2023, operating profit declined due to $45 million in losses on a classified program. By 2024, operating profit plummeted by $1.1 billion (73%), primarily due to $1.2 billion in lower profit booking rate adjustments, including $1.4 billion in losses on a classified program, despite the production ramp-up.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $65 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher risk retirements and volume (primarily PAC-3); about $45 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM) and higher risk retirements (primarily GMLRS); and approximately $20 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to the reversal of a portion of previously recorded losses on the Warrior program in the second and third quarters of 2021 that will not recur as a result of the program being terminated, which was partially offset by lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache). These increases were partially offset by charges of approximately $25 million due to performance issues on an energy program during the third quarter of 2021. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $85 million higher in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3 and air dominance programs.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect MFC's 2022 net sales to decrease in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by volume on SOF GLSS and funding on a classified program. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the low-single digit range below 2021 levels. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to increase slightly from 2021 levels.\n\n## Rotary and Mission Systems\n\nRMS designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea and landbased  missile  defense  systems,  radar  systems,  sea  and  air-based  mission  and  combat  systems,  command  and  control  mission solutions,  cyber  solutions,  and  simulation  and  training  solutions.

      "answer": "LMT's use of variable interest rate swaps evolved significantly from 2022 through 2024, reflecting a strategic shift in interest rate risk management. In 2022, the notional amount of interest rate swaps was $500 million as of December 31, 2021 (disclosed in the 2022 filing), indicating a relatively modest hedging position. By 2023, the notional amount of interest rate swaps had increased to $1.3 billion, a more than doubling of exposure, suggesting a proactive approach to managing interest rate risk amid rising borrowing levels or market uncertainty. This elevated notional amount remained unchanged in 2024, signaling a stabilization of the company's hedging strategy. The increase from 2021 to 2023 and the maintenance of that level in 2024 indicate that LMT shifted toward a more robust interest rate risk mitigation posture, likely in response to higher debt levels and a more volatile interest rate environment, while maintaining a consistent hedge profile thereafter.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM  7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor  the  financial  market  environment  and  actively  manage  counterparty  exposure  to  minimize  the  potential  impact  from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\n\nOur main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities.  Our  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk  principally  include  fixed-rate  long-term  debt  and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and the outstanding principal amount was $12.8 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2021.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the Polish Zloty. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges.  We  also  are  exposed  to  the  impact  of  interest  rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fixed  rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments  that  are  not  designated  as  hedges  and  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting,  which  are  intended  to  mitigate  certain economic exposures.\n\nThe classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $500 million and $572 million. The aggregate notional amount  of  our  outstanding  foreign  currency  hedges  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020  was  $4.0  billion  and  $3.4  billion.  At December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  net  fair  value  of  our  derivative  instruments  was  not  material  (see  'Note  16  -  Fair  Value Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency  contracts  would  be  offset  by  movement  on  the  underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit  exposure  to  individual  counterparties. We  do  not  hold  or  issue  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading  or  speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021, investments in the trust totaled $2.1 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of  the  trust  and  the  change  in  the  value  of  the  liabilities  are  recognized  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  in  other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.5 billion and $6.5 billion. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see 'Note 15 - Fair V alue Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter  into  foreign  currency  contracts  to  hedge  foreign  currency  ex posure  on  underlying  transactions,  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across many banks. We regularly monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2024, investments in the trust totaled $1.8 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fix ed-income securities that are ex posed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin reported $67.0 billion in net sales, with 71% from the U.S. Government, and emphasized affordability initiatives and internal R&D investments to deliver advanced technology systems amid pandemic-related disruptions. By 2023, net sales slightly increased to $67.6 billion, with U.S. Government revenue rising to 73%, and the company sharpened its strategic focus on 21st Century Security, emphasizing advanced networking, hypersonics, and classified programs. In 2024, Lockheed Martin demonstrated strong contractual execution capabilities, recognizing revenue over time using the cost-to-cost percentage of completion method, and maintained robust risk management around third-party guarantees and joint ventures, with $708 million in standby letters of credit tied to long-term contracts for advanced systems.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  included  in  Item  8  -  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nThe MD&amp;A generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019  items  and  year-to-year  comparisons  between  2020  and  2019  that  are  not  included  in  this  Form  10-K  can  be  found  in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations' in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nWe  are  a  global  security  and  aerospace  company  principally  engaged  in  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering,  technical,  scientific,  logistics,  system  integration  and  cybersecurity  services.  We  serve  both  U.S.  and  international customers with products and services that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal  customers  being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2021, 71% of our $67.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 62% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\n\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S.  and  international  customers  at  affordable  prices.  Recognizing  that  our  customers  are  resource  constrained,  we  place considerable focus on affordability initiatives while endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner,  with  a  focus  on  adjacent  markets  close  to  our  core  capabilities  as  well  as  growing  our  international  sales.  We  invest substantially  in  our  people  to  ensure  we  have  the  technical  skills  necessary  to  succeed,  and  we  expect  to  continue  to  invest internally on innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We will continue to invest  in  acquisitions,  as  appropriate,  while  deepening  our  connection  to  commercial  industry  through  cooperative  partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to present business challenges in 2021. We experienced impacts in each of our business areas  related  to  COVID-19,  primarily  in  continued  increased  coronavirus-related  costs,  delays  in  supplier  deliveries,  travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, employee absences, remote work and adjusted work schedules. During the first half  of  2021,  we  had  initiated  a  plan  to  reintroduce  employees  that  had  been  working  remotely  to  the  workplace,  however,  we paused the reintroduction as COVID-19 cases rose in the second half of 2021. Attendance for employees required to be onsite has fluctuated based on pandemic developments. We continued to take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, including  encouraging  employees  to  be  vaccinated.  We  also  continued  to  work  with  our  customers  and  suppliers  to  minimize disruptions, including using accelerated progress payments from the U.S. Government and cash on hand to accelerate $2.2 billion of payments to our suppliers as of December 31, 2021 that are due by their terms in future periods. We will continue to monitor risk driven by the pandemic and, based on our current assessment, we expect to continue to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk  assessed  need  through  the  end  of  2022.  Consistent  with  our  current  acceleration  approach,  we  will  prioritize  small  and COVID-19 impacted businesses.\n\nWe  are  closely  tracking  developments  regarding  vaccine  mandates.  Currently,  all  personnel  working  at  DoD  facilities, including  Lockheed  Martin  employees,  must  comply  with  DoD's  process  to  attest  to  vaccination  status.  Pursuant  to  the  DoD mandate,  this  is  required  for  physical  access  to  DoD  buildings  and  leased  spaces  in  non-DoD  buildings  where  official  agency business is performed. Additionally, until it was enjoined by a federal court in December 2021, pursuant to Executive Order 14042, referred  to  as  the  federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate,  all  U.S.  based  employees  of  Lockheed  Martin  and  most  of  its  suppliers, industry partners and contractors working directly or indirectly on covered government contracts, or working at a facility where those contracts are performed, administered, or otherwise supported, were to be fully vaccinated, or have an",

(a)\n\nAt December 31, 2024, third-party guarantees totaled $351 million, of which approximately 30% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. G enerally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently  available  information  and  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances. Actual  results  could  differ  from  our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. G overnment and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the  products  and  services.  Substantially  all  of  our  revenue  is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations in which control transfers continuously to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage of completion cost-to-cost measure of progress.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. We also estimate variable",

Cumulatively since December 2018, the company had transferred approximately $11.6 billion in pension obligations through such transactions. In 2023, the company reiterated its intent to continue evaluating pension risk transfer transactions as a strategy to manage liabilities, noting that future transactions could result in additional noncash settlement charges. By 2024, Lockheed Martin had continued this strategy, emphasizing ongoing pension obligation reductions through third-party transfers and highlighting the continued expectation to pursue additional transactions, despite the potential for material noncash charges.

The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nSimilar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. On August 3, 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The GACs were purchased using  assets  from  Lockheed  Martin's  master  retirement  trust  and  no  additional  funding  contribution  was  required  by  us.  This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans during the third quarter of 2021, which represents the accelerated  recognition  of  actuarial  losses  that  were  included  in  the  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  account  within stockholders' equity. As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets for the affected  defined  benefit  pension  plans  as  of  the  August  3,  2021  close  date.  The  purchase  of  the  GACs  and  the  pension remeasurement did not have an impact on our CAS pension cost and did not significantly impact our total FAS pension expense or net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021, except for the noncash pension settlement charge.\n\nInclusive of the transaction described above, since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $11.6 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension  plan  volatility  for  approximately  95,000  retirees  and  beneficiaries  and  annually  required  Pension  Benefit  Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $69 million per year.\n\nWe expect  to  continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  manage  our  pension  liabilities  through  additional  pension  risk  transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding  these  actions,  the  impact  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plans  on  our  earnings  may  be  volatile  in  that  the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.\n\n## Actuarial Assumptions\n\nThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, and employee turnover.  The  assumptions  we  make  affect  both  the  calculation  of  the  benefit  obligations  as  of  the  measurement  date  and  the calculation  of  FAS  expense  in  subsequent  periods.  When  reassessing  these  assumptions,  we  consider  past  and  current  market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\n\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 2.875% at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.50% at December 31, 2020. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 2.75% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our",

All of the estimates require significant judgement and are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident, which we refer to as a reach-forward loss.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution  of  contractual  matters,  cost  recoveries  on  severance  and  restructuring,  insurance  recoveries  and  gains  on  sales  of  assets. Unfavorable  items  may  include  the  adverse  resolution  of  contractual  matters,  supply  chain  disruptions,  restructuring  charges  (ex cept  for  significant  severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nFor the impacts of changes in estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. G overnment. Costbased pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S.  G overnment  contracts.  For  ex ample,  costs  such  as  those  related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  ex pense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For ex ample, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract  accounting.  Costs  incurred  and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. G overnment regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\n\n## Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Overview\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see 'Note 11 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in a defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nWe continue to take  actions  to  reduce  the  size  of  our  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  From  December  2018,  through  our  master  retirement  trust,  we  have transferred outstanding defined benefit pension obligations to third party insurance companies; reducing annually required Pension Benefit G uarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional pension risk transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity, as well as the timing of cash funding.",

      "answer": "Union Pacific's allocation to Collective Trust and Other Funds decreased from $756 million in 2022 to $382 million in 2023, indicating a significant reduction in exposure over this period. The 2024 filing does not provide updated allocation figures but explains that these funds are valued using net asset value (NAV), derived from shares or units in commingled funds and limited liability companies with underlying assets like global stock funds and short-term investments. This valuation methodology suggests that while the company continues to hold these types of investments, the reduction in dollar value from 2022 to 2023 may reflect a deliberate rebalancing or risk management decision rather than a change in valuation approach. The NAV-based measurement supports transparency in tracking these assets over time despite fluctuations in reported amounts.",

T he following is a description of the v aluation methodologies used for the inv estments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the v aluation hierarchy.\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Gov ernment Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the  U.S.  T reasury  or  by  gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises.  T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using NAV for each inv estment.",

      "question": "How did Union Pacific's allocation to corporate stock within its pension plan evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this shift suggest about the company's investment strategy in equities over this period?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific's allocation to corporate stock within its pension plan significantly decreased from $1,990 million in 2022 to $181 million in 2023, and further declined to $1,116 million in 2024. This represents a drop of over 90% between 2022 and 2023, followed by a partial rebound in 2024, but still well below the initial level. The shift suggests a strategic move away from direct equity exposure in favor of fixed income instruments, particularly bonds and federal securities, indicating a more conservative investment posture over the three-year period.",

T he following is a description of the v aluation methodologies used for the inv estments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the v aluation hierarchy.\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Gov ernment Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the  U.S.  T reasury  or  by  gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises.  T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using NAV for each inv estment.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Union Pacific's total Multiple Purpose Locomotives declined from 7,242 units to 6,893 units, with a reduction in owned units from 6,204 to 5,973 and leased units decreasing from 1,038 to 920. The average age of these locomotives increased from 22.5 years in 2022 to 24.3 years in 2023, and further to 25.2 years in 2024, suggesting a lack of significant new investment in this category and a potential reliance on aging assets. This trend implies a conservative asset management strategy, with minimal fleet expansion and a gradual decline in total units over the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did Union Pacific's utilization and leasing strategy for freight cars evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of cost impact, lease portfolio disclosures, and fleet composition changes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Union Pacific reported increased freight car rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity, indicating higher dependency on leased assets under operational strain. In 2023, the company provided more structured disclosures around its leasing portfolio, noting leases for locomotives, freight cars, and other operational property, though specific cost figures were not detailed. By 2024, the total freight car fleet reached 56,176 units, with 22,472 leased, showing a continued reliance on leased assets. The average age of leased freight cars varied significantly by type, with open hoppers at 37.8 years and refrigerated cars at 20.1 years, suggesting a mixed strategy of modernization and cost management. This progression reveals a shift from reactive leasing in 2022 to more strategic and transparent fleet management by 2024.",

        "Hop 1: [UNP](2022) \u2192 [Freight Cars]: Freight car rent expense increased due to volume and slower velocity, indicating higher leasing costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses increased $767 million in 2021 compared to  2020  driven  by  higher  fuel  prices,  volume-related  costs, inflation,  higher  casualty  costs,  2020  management  actions, weather and wildfire-related expenses, incentive compensation,  and  higher  state  and  local  taxes.  Partially offsetting  these  increases  compared  to  2020  include  a  $278 million  impairment  charge  in  2020,  productivity  initiatives,  a one-time  bonus  payment  for  agreement  employees  in  2020, and lower severance costs. Full year results of 2021 and 2020 both include a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n2021 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits -  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension  costs,  and  incentive  costs.  In  2021,  expenses  increased  4%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  volume  related costs,  inflation,  2020  management  actions  responding  to  the  sharp  decline  in  volume  (temporary  unpaid  leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\n\nDepreciation -  The  majority  of  depreciation  relates  to  road  property,  including  rail,  ties,  ballast,  and  other  track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nFuel -  Fuel  includes  locomotive  fuel  and  gasoline  for  highway  and  non-highway  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared  to  $1.50  per  gallon  in  2020,  increased  expenses  $668  million  (excluding  any  impact  from  increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased  from  outside  contractors  and  other  service  providers  (including  equipment  maintenance  and  contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad's lines, structures, and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile  maintenance  expenses;  and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  services  and  materials  increased  3%  in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with  our  intermodal  business,  higher  costs  due  to  weather  and  wildfire-related  events,  increased  locomotive  and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\n\nEquipment  and  Other  Rents -  Equipment  and  other  rents  expense  primarily  includes  rental  expense  that  the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;  and  office  and  other  rent  expenses,  offset  by  equity  income  from  certain  equity  method  investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and  higher  equity  income  from  our  investment  in  TTX  Company,  partially  offset  by  increased  freight  car  rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\n\nOther - Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal  injury,  environmental,  employee  travel,  telephone  and  cellular,  computer  software,  bad  debt,  and  other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million noncash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital  projects,  2020  lease  impairments,  and  higher  equity  income.  Partially  offsetting  these  decreases  were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local  taxes.  Both  periods  in  2021  and  2020  included  a  reduction  of  expense  for  weather  and  wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lockheed Martin maintained Black Hawk helicopters as a core component of its Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) portfolio, but the company's production emphasis shifted in response to broader defense program dynamics. In 2022, RMS highlighted Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters as part of a suite of major programs, alongside PAC-3 and LCS, with a projected decline in net sales driven by volume on SOF GLSS and classified programs. In 2023, RMS again listed Black Hawk helicopters prominently, but the broader MFC segment saw a 1% sales decline, partly due to supplier cost timing on PAC-3 and the absence of a prior-year profit adjustment. By 2024, RMS continued to feature Black Hawk prominently, while MFC net sales surged 13%\u2014driven by tactical missile programs like GMLRS, LRASM, and JASSM\u2014indicating a strategic pivot toward missile systems amid increased backlog on those platforms. This suggests that while Black Hawk remained a consistent product offering, LMT's strategic focus shifted toward missile production growth over the 3-year period.",

        "Hop 1: [LMT](2022) \u2192 [Black Hawk Helicopters]: Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters were listed among RMS' major programs, but MFC net sales were expected to decline due to volume on SOF GLSS and funding on a classified program.",
        "Hop 2: [LMT](2024) \u2192 [Black Hawk Helicopters]: Black Hawk remained a core RMS program, but MFC net sales increased 13% due to production ramp-up on GMLRS, LRASM, and JASSM, with backlog growth on those missile systems.",
        "Hop 3: [LMT](2023) \u2192 [Black Hawk Helicopters]: Black Hawk was again highlighted in RMS' major programs, but MFC net sales decreased 1% compared to 2022, with declines in integrated air and missile defense programs offset partially by growth in tactical and strike missile programs."

The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $340 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher volume and risk retirements (primarily PAC-3); and about $215 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM). These increases  were  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  of  approximately  $90  million  for  sensors  and  global  sustainment programs due to lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache)  that  was  partially  offset  by  close  out  activities  related  to  the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (Warrior) that was terminated by the customer in March 2021. \u00ae\n\nMFC's operating profit in 2021 increased $103 million, or 7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $65 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher risk retirements and volume (primarily PAC-3); about $45 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM) and higher risk retirements (primarily GMLRS); and approximately $20 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to the reversal of a portion of previously recorded losses on the Warrior program in the second and third quarters of 2021 that will not recur as a result of the program being terminated, which was partially offset by lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache). These increases were partially offset by charges of approximately $25 million due to performance issues on an energy program during the third quarter of 2021. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $85 million higher in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3 and air dominance programs.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect MFC's 2022 net sales to decrease in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by volume on SOF GLSS and funding on a classified program. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the low-single digit range below 2021 levels. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to increase slightly from 2021 levels.\n\n## Rotary and Mission Systems\n\nRMS designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea and landbased  missile  defense  systems,  radar  systems,  sea  and  air-based  mission  and  combat  systems,  command  and  control  mission solutions,  cyber  solutions,  and  simulation  and  training  solutions.

      "question": "How did LMT's use of variable interest rate swaps evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the trend in notional amounts reveal about the company's interest rate risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LMT had an aggregate notional amount of $500 million in outstanding interest rate swaps. By 2023, this amount increased significantly to $1.3 billion, and it remained at $1.3 billion in 2024. This fourfold increase from 2022 to 2023 indicates a strategic shift toward more active interest rate risk management, likely in response to rising interest rates or increased debt levels. The stabilization of the notional amount in 2024 suggests that LMT had established a new hedging baseline, converting more of its fixed-rate debt to variable rates to better align with market conditions and manage fair value exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [LMT](2022) \u2192 [Variable Interest Rate Swaps]: Notional amount was $500 million, indicating a relatively modest use of swaps for fair value hedging.",
        "Hop 2: [LMT](2023) \u2192 [Variable Interest Rate Swaps]: Notional amount increased to $1.3 billion, showing a significant expansion in the use of swaps, likely to hedge newly issued fixed-rate debt.",
        "Hop 3: [LMT](2024) \u2192 [Variable Interest Rate Swaps]: Notional amount remained at $1.3 billion, suggesting the strategy implemented in 2023 was maintained as part of a stable risk management framework."

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor  the  financial  market  environment  and  actively  manage  counterparty  exposure  to  minimize  the  potential  impact  from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\n\nOur main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities.  Our  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk  principally  include  fixed-rate  long-term  debt  and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and the outstanding principal amount was $12.8 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.1 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2021.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the Polish Zloty. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges.  We  also  are  exposed  to  the  impact  of  interest  rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fixed  rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments  that  are  not  designated  as  hedges  and  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting,  which  are  intended  to  mitigate  certain economic exposures.\n\nThe classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $500 million and $572 million. The aggregate notional amount  of  our  outstanding  foreign  currency  hedges  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020  was  $4.0  billion  and  $3.4  billion.  At December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  net  fair  value  of  our  derivative  instruments  was  not  material  (see  'Note  16  -  Fair  Value Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency  contracts  would  be  offset  by  movement  on  the  underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit  exposure  to  individual  counterparties. We  do  not  hold  or  issue  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading  or  speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021, investments in the trust totaled $2.1 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of  the  trust  and  the  change  in  the  value  of  the  liabilities  are  recognized  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  in  other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  included  in  Item  8  -  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nThe MD&amp;A generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019  items  and  year-to-year  comparisons  between  2020  and  2019  that  are  not  included  in  this  Form  10-K  can  be  found  in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations' in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nWe  are  a  global  security  and  aerospace  company  principally  engaged  in  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering,  technical,  scientific,  logistics,  system  integration  and  cybersecurity  services.  We  serve  both  U.S.  and  international customers with products and services that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal  customers  being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2021, 71% of our $67.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 62% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\n\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S.  and  international  customers  at  affordable  prices.  Recognizing  that  our  customers  are  resource  constrained,  we  place considerable focus on affordability initiatives while endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner,  with  a  focus  on  adjacent  markets  close  to  our  core  capabilities  as  well  as  growing  our  international  sales.  We  invest substantially  in  our  people  to  ensure  we  have  the  technical  skills  necessary  to  succeed,  and  we  expect  to  continue  to  invest internally on innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We will continue to invest  in  acquisitions,  as  appropriate,  while  deepening  our  connection  to  commercial  industry  through  cooperative  partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to present business challenges in 2021. We experienced impacts in each of our business areas  related  to  COVID-19,  primarily  in  continued  increased  coronavirus-related  costs,  delays  in  supplier  deliveries,  travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, employee absences, remote work and adjusted work schedules. During the first half  of  2021,  we  had  initiated  a  plan  to  reintroduce  employees  that  had  been  working  remotely  to  the  workplace,  however,  we paused the reintroduction as COVID-19 cases rose in the second half of 2021. Attendance for employees required to be onsite has fluctuated based on pandemic developments. We continued to take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, including  encouraging  employees  to  be  vaccinated.  We  also  continued  to  work  with  our  customers  and  suppliers  to  minimize disruptions, including using accelerated progress payments from the U.S. Government and cash on hand to accelerate $2.2 billion of payments to our suppliers as of December 31, 2021 that are due by their terms in future periods. We will continue to monitor risk driven by the pandemic and, based on our current assessment, we expect to continue to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk  assessed  need  through  the  end  of  2022.  Consistent  with  our  current  acceleration  approach,  we  will  prioritize  small  and COVID-19 impacted businesses.\n\nWe  are  closely  tracking  developments  regarding  vaccine  mandates.  Currently,  all  personnel  working  at  DoD  facilities, including  Lockheed  Martin  employees,  must  comply  with  DoD's  process  to  attest  to  vaccination  status.  Pursuant  to  the  DoD mandate,  this  is  required  for  physical  access  to  DoD  buildings  and  leased  spaces  in  non-DoD  buildings  where  official  agency business is performed. Additionally, until it was enjoined by a federal court in December 2021, pursuant to Executive Order 14042, referred  to  as  the  federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate,  all  U.S.  based  employees  of  Lockheed  Martin  and  most  of  its  suppliers, industry partners and contractors working directly or indirectly on covered government contracts, or working at a facility where those contracts are performed, administered, or otherwise supported, were to be fully vaccinated, or have an",

(a)\n\nAt December 31, 2024, third-party guarantees totaled $351 million, of which approximately 30% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. G enerally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently  available  information  and  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances. Actual  results  could  differ  from  our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. G overnment and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the  products  and  services.  Substantially  all  of  our  revenue  is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations in which control transfers continuously to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage of completion cost-to-cost measure of progress.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. We also estimate variable",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin referenced a pension risk transfer transaction from August 2021, where $4.9 billion in pension obligations were transferred via group annuity contracts (GACs), resulting in a $1.7 billion noncash pension settlement charge. Since December 2018, the company had transferred approximately $11.6 billion in pension obligations, reducing PBGC premiums by $69 million annually. In 2023, LMT emphasized ongoing evaluation of future pension risk transfer transactions and acknowledged the potential for additional contributions or noncash settlement charges, while also highlighting the volatility in pension expense due to economic assumptions. By 2024, the company had continued this strategy, noting that from December 2018 onward, it had consistently transferred pension obligations to insurance companies, reducing exposure and PBGC premiums, and reaffirmed its intent to pursue further transactions, despite the potential for material noncash settlement charges. The trend shows a consistent, strategic reduction in pension liabilities through GACs, with increasing scale and financial clarity over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Overview\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life  insurance  plans  and  other  postemployment  plans  (collectively,  postretirement  benefit  plans  -  see  'Note  12  -  Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nSimilar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. On August 3, 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The GACs were purchased using  assets  from  Lockheed  Martin's  master  retirement  trust  and  no  additional  funding  contribution  was  required  by  us.  This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans during the third quarter of 2021, which represents the accelerated  recognition  of  actuarial  losses  that  were  included  in  the  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  account  within stockholders' equity. As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets for the affected  defined  benefit  pension  plans  as  of  the  August  3,  2021  close  date.  The  purchase  of  the  GACs  and  the  pension remeasurement did not have an impact on our CAS pension cost and did not significantly impact our total FAS pension expense or net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021, except for the noncash pension settlement charge.\n\nInclusive of the transaction described above, since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $11.6 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension  plan  volatility  for  approximately  95,000  retirees  and  beneficiaries  and  annually  required  Pension  Benefit  Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $69 million per year.\n\nWe expect  to  continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  manage  our  pension  liabilities  through  additional  pension  risk  transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding  these  actions,  the  impact  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plans  on  our  earnings  may  be  volatile  in  that  the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.\n\n## Actuarial Assumptions\n\nThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, and employee turnover.  The  assumptions  we  make  affect  both  the  calculation  of  the  benefit  obligations  as  of  the  measurement  date  and  the calculation  of  FAS  expense  in  subsequent  periods.  When  reassessing  these  assumptions,  we  consider  past  and  current  market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\n\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 2.875% at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.50% at December 31, 2020. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 2.75% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our",

All of the estimates require significant judgement and are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident, which we refer to as a reach-forward loss.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts.

Unfavorable  items  may  include  the  adverse  resolution  of  contractual  matters,  supply  chain  disruptions,  restructuring  charges  (ex cept  for  significant  severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nFor the impacts of changes in estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. G overnment. Costbased pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S.  G overnment  contracts.  For  ex ample,  costs  such  as  those  related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  ex pense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For ex ample, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract  accounting.  Costs  incurred  and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. G overnment regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\n\n## Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Overview\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see 'Note 11 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in a defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nWe continue to take  actions  to  reduce  the  size  of  our  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  From  December  2018,  through  our  master  retirement  trust,  we  have transferred outstanding defined benefit pension obligations to third party insurance companies; reducing annually required Pension Benefit G uarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional pension risk transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity, as well as the timing of cash funding.",

      "question": "How did UPS's treatment and disclosure around its 7.620% debentures evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of redemption terms, interest payment structure, and overall debt positioning?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS consistently disclosed the $276 million 7.620% debentures maturing in 2030, with unchanged redemption terms allowing UPS to redeem them at any time at a price equal to the greater of principal plus accrued interest or the present value of remaining payments discounted at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points. In 2022, the debentures were highlighted in the context of interest rate history (8.375% until April 2020, then 7.620%) and semi-annual interest payments. By 2023, the debentures were presented in a broader debt table showing a book value of $280 million, consistent with the prior year. In 2024, the debentures were again described in detail, but with a sharper focus on the redemption mechanics and interest payment schedule, while being positioned within a larger context of international debt instruments such as Pound Sterling and Euro notes. This 3-year progression shows a shift from historical interest rate context to a more structural and comparative treatment of the debentures within UPS's global debt portfolio.",

        "Hop 2: [UPS](2023) \u2192 [7.620% Debentures]: Positioned within a comprehensive debt table showing $280 million book value, with no changes to terms.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 7.620% Debentures\n\nThe $276 million debentures have a maturity of April 1, 2030. These debentures had an interest rate of 8.375% until April 1, 2020, at which time the interest rate decreased to 7.620% for the remaining term. These debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time. The redemption price is equal to the greater of the principal amount plus accrued interest, or the present value of remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points, plus accrued interest. Interest is payable semi-annually in April and October, and the debentures are not subject to sinking fund requirements.\n\n## Floating-Rate Senior Notes\n\nOur floating-rate senior notes bear interest at rates that reference the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") for U.S. Dollars. As part of a broader program of reference rate reform, it is expected that U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates will cease to be published after June 2023.\n\nWe have floating-rate senior notes in the principal amounts of $400 and $500 million that bear interest at three-month LIBOR, plus a spread of 38 and 45 basis points, respectively. These notes are not callable. The $400 million notes mature in 2022 and the $500 million notes mature in 2023, prior to the expected discontinuance of U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The average interest rate for 2021 and 2020, including interest on the $350 million floating-rate senior notes that matured on April 1, 2021, was 0.58% and 1.29%, respectively.\n\nThe remaining floating-rate senior notes, with principal amounts totaling $1.0 billion, bear interest at either one or threemonth LIBOR, less a spread ranging from 30 to 45 basis points. These notes have maturities ranging from 2049 through 2067 and will be impacted by the discontinuance of U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates in June 2023. We are currently working to transition these notes to an alternative reference rate. We anticipate that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") will be adopted in accordance with recommendations of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee.\n\nThe average interest rate on the remaining floating-rate senior notes for 2021 and 2020 was 0.00% and 0.40%, respectively. These notes are callable at various times after 30 years at a stated percentage of par value, and redeemable at the option of the note holders at various times after one year at a stated percentage of par value. We have classified these floating-rate senior notes as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, due to our intent and ability to refinance the debt if the put option is exercised.",

      "question": "How did the role and operational structure of UPS SurePost evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of delivery methodology and strategic positioning within UPS's U.S. Domestic Package business?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS SurePost was positioned as a residential ground service for non-urgent, lightweight shipments, leveraging the consistency of the UPS ground network with final delivery often handled by the U.S. Postal Service. By 2023, UPS SurePost retained the same description, indicating continuity in its delivery methodology and strategic positioning. In 2024, UPS announced that beginning January 1, 2025, it would insource the final delivery component of UPS SurePost, shifting from reliance on USPS to internal control to enhance service quality. This marks a strategic transformation in the delivery methodology of SurePost, signaling UPS\u2019s intent to improve reliability and service differentiation in the residential delivery segment.",

          "chunk_text": "We offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages seven days a week. Our global network offers approximately 188,000 entry points where customers can tender packages to us at locations and times convenient to them. This includes UPS drivers who can accept packages, UPS drop boxes, UPS Access Point locations, The UPS Store locations, authorized shipping outlets and commercial counters, alliance locations and customer centers attached to UPS facilities. Our UPS Access Point network includes local small businesses and national retailers. This network allows consumers to ship or redirect packages to an alternate delivery location or to drop off pre-labeled packages, including returns. The UPS Access Point network includes more than 20,000 locations within the U.S. and 52,000 globally.\n\nWe offer a portfolio of returns services in more than 140 countries. These services are driven by the continued growth of ecommerce that has increased our customers' need for efficient and reliable returns, and are designed to promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience. This portfolio provides a range of cost-effective label and digital returns options and a broad network of consumer drop points. We also offer a selection of returns technologies, such as UPS Returns Manager, that promote systems integration, increase customer ease of use and visibility of inbound merchandise. These technologies help reduce costs and improve efficiency in our customers' reverse logistics processes.\n\nOur global air operations are based in Louisville, Kentucky, and are supported by air hubs across the United States and internationally. We operate international air hubs in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Canada and Florida (for Latin America and the Caribbean). This network design enables cost-effective package processing in our most technology-enabled facilities, which allows us to use fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nWe are a leader in time-definite, guaranteed small package delivery services in the United States. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed air and ground package transportation services. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous United States.\n\n- Our air portfolio offers time-definite, same day, next day, two day and three day delivery alternatives.\n- Our ground network enables customers to ship using our day-definite guaranteed ground service. We deliver more ground packages in the U.S. than any other carrier, with average daily package volume of more than 17 million, most within one to three business days.\n- UPS SurePost provides residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. It offers the consistency and reliability of the UPS ground network, with final delivery often provided by the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Latin America and ISMEA. International high-growth markets are one of our identified growth opportunities. We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services, including more guaranteed time-definite express options than any other carrier.\n\nFor international package shipments that do not require express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, guaranteed day-definite service option. For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada, and between the U.S. and Mexico. UPS Worldwide Express Freight is a premium international service for urgent, palletized shipments over 150 pounds.\n\nEurope is our largest region outside of the U.S. and, in 2021, accounted for nearly half of our international package segment revenue. We continue to make major European infrastructure investments to meet growing demand for our services and to improve transit times across the region. Customers can reach more than 80% of Europe's population within two business days using UPS Standard.\n\nWe serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and territories through more than two dozen alliances with local delivery companies that supplement our owned operations.\n\nThe introduction of a direct flight from the U.S. to Dubai has improved time-in-transit to key destinations in ISMEA for shippers throughout the U.S., Canada and Latin America. In India, we are investing in our network to improve transit times and extend pickup times, allowing businesses to gain faster access to markets in Europe and the United States.",

Beginning January 1, 2025, in order to have more control over our ability to provide our customers industry-leading service, we have insourced this product. For additional information, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa (together \"EMEA\"), Canada and Latin America (together \"Americas\") and Asia.

      "question": "How did the 2023 Teamsters collective bargaining agreement impact pension benefit accruals under the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan, and what does this reveal about UPS's long-term pension obligations as reflected in the 2024 disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan was described as a noncontributory plan covering employees previously in the Central States Pension Fund and others under collective bargaining agreements. In 2023, the Teamsters employees ratified a new five-year agreement that included wage and benefit rate increases for participants in this plan, which directly impacted pension benefit accruals and were factored into the year-end plan measurement. By 2024, the disclosures showed no structural changes to the plan, indicating that the 2023 agreement represented the most recent material update to benefit accruals. The 2023 changes suggest a continuation of defined benefit commitments under collective bargaining, with implications for UPS's long-term pension liabilities as they relate to funded status and future obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 6. COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans which cover our employees worldwide.\n\n## U.S. Pension Benefits\n\nIn the U.S. we maintain the following single-employer defined benefit pension plans: the UPS Retirement Plan, the UPS Pension Plan, the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan, a non-qualified plan.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries hired prior to July 1, 2016 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax-qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS').\n\nThe UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan will cease accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, certain former U.S. employees were offered the option to receive a one-time payment of their vested pension benefit. Approximately 18,800 former employees accepted this option, accelerating $820 million in benefit payments during 2019 while reducing the number of participants who are due future payments from U.S. pension plans. As the cost of these settlements did not exceed the plans' service cost and interest cost for the year, the impact of the settlement was not recognized in earnings.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight as discussed in note 4. The divestiture triggered an interim remeasurement of certain UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement medical benefit plans under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715- Compensation- Retirement Benefits ('ASC 715'). Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and benefit obligations of the UPS Pension Plan, UPS Retirement Plan and UPS Retired Employee Health Care Plan as of April 30, 2021.\n\nThe interim remeasurement resulted in an actuarial gain of $2.1 billion. The actuarial gain reflects a $3.7 billion benefit from a 49 basis point increase in the discount rate compared to December 31, 2020 and a $0.1 billion benefit related to workforce reductions associated with the divestiture, offset by a $1.7 billion loss resulting from actual returns being approximately 430 basis points below expected returns. The $2.1 billion actuarial gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. A pre-tax actuarial gain of $69 million ($52 million after tax) was immediately recognized for a prior service credit related to the divested group in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter. We also amended certain benefit terms within these plans as of April 30, 2021. The amendment to the UPS Pension Plan resulted in the immediate recognition of a $66 million ($50 million after tax) loss in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter.\n\nThe impacts of the plan remeasurements and plan amendments are included within Other expenses in the statements of consolidated income as components of the divestiture of UPS Freight.",

We believe that our integrated global air and ground network is the most extensive in the industry. We provide all types of package services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through a single pickup and delivery network. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize network efficiency and asset utilization.\n\nGlobal Presence. We serve more than 220 countries and territories. We have a significant presence in all of the world's major economies, allowing us to effectively and efficiently operate around the world.\n\nCutting-Edge Technologies. We are a global leader in developing technologies that help our customers enhance their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency. We offer a variety of online tools that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own websites, deepening our customer relationships. These tools allow customers to send, manage and track their shipments, and also to provide their customers with better information services.\n\nA Broad Portfolio of Services. Our portfolio of services helps customers choose their most appropriate delivery option. Increasingly, our customers benefit from UPS business solutions that integrate our services beyond package delivery. For example, supply chain services - such as freight forwarding, truckload brokerage, customs brokerage, order fulfillment and returns management - help improve the efficiency of our customers' entire supply chain management process.\n\nCustomer Relationships. We focus on building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. Providing value-added services beyond package delivery, and cross-selling small package and supply chain services across our customer base, are important retention tools and growth mechanisms for us.\n\nBrand Equity. We have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality, reliability and service innovation. Our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.\n\nDistinctive Culture. We believe that the dedication of our employees comes in large part from our distinctive 'employeeowner' culture. Our founders believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, and the employee stock ownership tradition dates back to our first stock ownership program in 1927. Our legacy of fairness and equity is the bedrock of our culture and of our relationships with those we serve.\n\nFinancial Strength. Our financial strength allows us to generate value for our shareowners by investing in technology, transportation equipment, facilities and employee development; pursuing strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth and maintaining a strong credit rating that gives us flexibility in running the business.\n\n## Products and Services; Reporting Segments\n\nWe have two reporting segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. U.S. Domestic Package and International Package are together referred to as our global small package operations.\n\n## Global Small Package\n\nOur global small package operations provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. These services are supported by numerous shipping, visibility and billing technologies. For example, our Digital Access Program makes it easier for SMBs to use our services by embedding our shipping solutions directly into leading e-commerce platforms.\n\nAll services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) are managed through a single, global smart logistics network. We combine all packages within our network, unless dictated by specific service commitments. This enables us to efficiently pick up customers' shipments for any services at a scheduled time each day. Our integrated network provides unique operational and capital efficiencies that have a lower environmental impact than single service network designs.",

UPS drivers can also directly accept packages.\n\nWe offer a portfolio of returns services in approximately 150 countries. These returns services are driven by the continued prevalence of e-commerce that has increased our customers' needs for efficient and reliable returns and are designed to promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience.\n\nOur global air operations hub is located in Louisville, Kentucky, and is supported by air hubs across the United States (\"U.S.\") and internationally. We operate international air hubs in G ermany, China, Hong Kong, Canada and Florida (for Latin America and the Caribbean). This design enables cost-effective package processing using fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nWe are a leader in time-definite, guaranteed small package delivery services in the United States. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic air and ground package transportation services. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous United States.\n\n- Our air portfolio offers time-definite, same-day, nex t-day, two-day and three-day delivery alternatives as well as air cargo services.\n- Our ground network enables customers to ship using our day-definite ground service. We deliver approximately 16 million ground packages per day, most within one to three business days.\n- UPS SurePost provides residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. Through 2024, final delivery was often provided by the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"). Beginning January 1, 2025, in order to have more control over our ability to provide our customers industry-leading service, we have insourced this product. For additional information, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa (together \"EMEA\"), Canada and Latin America (together \"Americas\") and Asia. We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services.\n\nFor international package shipments that do not require express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, day-definite service option. For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada, and between the U.S. and Mexico. Worldwide Economy offers a contract-only, e-commerce solution for non-urgent, cross-border shipments. UPS Worldwide Express Freight is a premium international service for urgent, palletized shipments over 150 pounds.\n\n## Supply Chain Solutions\n\nSupply Chain Solutions consists of our forwarding, logistics, digital and other businesses. Serving more than 200 countries and territories, we strategically seek to provide integration across increasingly complex, specialized and fragmented supply chains.\n\n## Forwarding\n\nWe are one of the largest U.S. domestic airfreight carriers and airfreight forwarders globally. We offer a portfolio of guaranteed and non-guaranteed global airfreight services. Additionally, as one of the world's leading non-vessel operating common carriers, we provide ocean freight full container load, less-than-container load and multimodal transportation services between most major ports around the world. We also provide customs brokerage as well as various related services.\n\nIn September 2024, we completed the divestiture of our truckload brokerage business (\"Coyote\"). For additional information on this divestiture, see note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Logistics\n\nOur global logistics and distribution business provides value-added fulfillment and transportation management services. We operate both multi-client and dedicated facilities across our network, many of which are strategically located near UPS air",

      "question": "How did the geographic reach of FedEx International Connect Plus evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this expansion trajectory suggest about FedEx's e-commerce growth strategy?",
      "answer": "The geographic reach of FedEx International Connect Plus expanded significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the service was available from nearly 50 origin countries to over 130 destination countries. By 2023, this had increased to nearly 60 origin countries and over 190 destination countries. This expansion continued into 2024, with the service maintaining the same level of global reach (nearly 60 origin countries to over 190 destination countries), indicating a stabilization after rapid growth. This trajectory suggests that FedEx strategically prioritized expanding its e-commerce logistics footprint to meet growing global demand, particularly in underpenetrated markets, and has now reached a mature stage of international coverage for this service.",

          "chunk_text": "International express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from more than 90 countries and Caribbean islands in one or two business days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Mexico. Federal Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China, and South Africa. In addition, Federal Ex press offers comprehensive international ex press and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance.\n\nOur FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 25 countries and territories. Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual e-commerce service currently available from nearly 60 origin countries to over 190 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days.\n\n## Operations\n\nFederal Express's largest sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company's multiple hub-and-spoke system and worldwide air network. A second national air hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities to ex pand and modernize our Indianapolis hub and modernize our Memphis hub. See the 'Financial Condition - Liquidity Outlook' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information. In addition to these national air hubs, Federal Express operates regional air hubs in Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland, and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities at airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta.\n\nFacilities at airports in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, G uangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for ex press package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, G uangzhou, and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional air hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami serves our South Florida, Latin American, and Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large European markets. In addition to its worldwide air network, Federal Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and South America. Federal Express's unique European road network connects more than 45 countries and territories through 28 transit hubs and more than 600 stations.\n\nWith the recent significant growth of e-commerce and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are fundamentally redesigning our international air network in connection with our DRIVE transformation program. The redesigned network will continue to deploy FedEx-owned aircraft in the delivery of International Priority parcel shipments using our existing hub-and-spoke model. Additionally, a portion of our owned aircraft fleet will be retimed to operate off-cycle, allowing us to build density, decongest hubs, and connect our global surface networks. Finally, we will continue to leverage our global partner network as an adaptive capacity layer, particularly on imbalanced trade lanes, to move e-commerce and deferred volumes.\n\nThroughout its worldwide network, Federal Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers, and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station's service area. In some international areas, independent agents ('Global Service Participants') have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see 'Item 2. Properties' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Federal Express Segment.'\n\nFederal Express also operates a highly flexible surface network of over 700 legacy FedEx Ground sortation and distribution facilities, including 165 fully automated stations, as of June 7, 2024. Federal Ex press conducts these operations in the U.S. primarily with more than 95,000 motorized vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. Through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which we pick up, transport, and deliver packages in the U.S. and Canada, these operations are being consolidated into the surface operations of Federal Express. We have implemented Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and began the phased transition of all legacy FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to Federal Express surface operations in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, Federal Express will continue to utilize both its employee couriers and contracted service providers in U.S. surface operations using a market-by-market approach. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information on Network 2.0.\n\nFederal Express continues to maximize the use of existing U.S. surface facilities through Network 2.0. Many of these facilities utilize advanced automated unloading and sorting technology to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. This technology includes a yard management system in many facilities which interacts with GPS tags on trailers to automatically notify the control",

          "chunk_text": "International express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of timedefinite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from nearly 200 countries and territories in one or two business days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Mexico.

In addition, FedEx Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance.\n\nOur FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 20 countries and territories.

Our 2016 acquisition of TNT Express accelerated our European and global growth; substantially enhanced our global footprint through TNT Express's lower-cost road networks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; and expanded our capabilities and solutions for our customers. The completion of the physical network integration of TNT Express into FedEx Express in 2022 and consolidation of flights into our Paris hub allow us to significantly improve operational efficiency. We are currently in the process of migrating customers from services offered by TNT Express to the FedEx Express portfolio of services. Additionally, we continue to execute initiatives to transform and optimize the FedEx Express international business, particularly in Europe. For more information regarding our international strategy and related costs, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report.\n\nWe also have expanded our capabilities in the Asia-Pacific markets, including through the establishment of our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China; our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which serves as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S.; and our International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport. During 2020, we added 14 new Asia-Pacific origin markets for FedEx International First service to the U.S. and Canada. These developments allow us to continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets.\n\nIn December 2021, FedEx Express entered into a strategic alliance with Delhivery, a leading logistics and supply chain services company in India. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\nTo facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.\n\n## U.S. Postal Service Agreement\n\nIn 2013, FedEx Express entered into a new seven-year agreement with the U.S. Postal Service ('USPS') under which FedEx Express provides airport-to-airport transportation of USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail within the U.S. In 2017, the parties entered into an amendment to the agreement whereby the initial renewal period provided in the agreement was exercised in part and the agreement's period of performance was extended through September 29, 2024. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS's international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Pricing\n\nFedEx Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 3, 2022, FedEx Express implemented a 5.9% average list price increase for U.S. domestic, U.S. export, and U.S. import services.",

      "question": "How did FedEx's amendments and utilization of the Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA) evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's liquidity strategy during this period?",
      "answer": "FedEx's utilization and amendment history of the Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA) shows a consistent reliance on and modification of this instrument to support its liquidity needs. In 2022, the agreement was already in place with BNP Paribas acting as Liquidity Provider, indicating active use of the facility. In 2023, FedEx filed Amendment No. 1 dated May 22, 2023, to the Liquidity Provider Revolving Credit Agreement, signaling a need to adjust terms in response to evolving financial conditions or operational requirements. By 2024, the agreement remained a core part of FedEx\u2019s credit infrastructure, with no further amendments mentioned, suggesting a stabilization of terms post-2023. This progression indicates that FedEx actively managed its liquidity through this facility, adapting it to changing business dynamics before settling into a more stable structure by FY2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [FDX](2023) \u2192 [Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA)]: Amendment No. 1 dated May 22, 2023, to the Liquidity Provider Revolving Credit Agreement was filed, indicating a formal modification to the original terms.",
        "Hop 2: [FDX](2024) \u2192 [Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA)]: The agreement remained in effect with no further amendments mentioned, suggesting that the 2023 changes had sufficiently addressed liquidity needs.",
        "Hop 3: [FDX](2022) \u2192 [Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA)]: The agreement was referenced in its original form, showing it was already in active use as a key liquidity instrument prior to any amendments."

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, FedEx referenced the 5.250% Note due 2050 as part of its August 13, 2020 Form 8-K filing, indicating its inclusion in the company's long-term debt structure. In fiscal year 2023, FedEx disclosed Amendment No. 1, dated May 22, 2023, to the Liquidity Provider Revolving Credit Agreement, which was tied to the same financing structure that included the 5.250% Note due 2050. By fiscal year 2024, the company continued to reference the 5.250% Note due 2050 in the context of its broader financing agreements, maintaining the same structural references as in prior years. This progression indicates that while the foundational debt instrument remained unchanged, FedEx actively managed its liquidity arrangements tied to this long-term note, suggesting a strategic approach to maintaining flexibility in its long-term financing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx International Connect Plus was available from nearly 50 origin countries to over 130 destination countries. By 2023, this had expanded to nearly 60 origin countries and over 190 destination countries, indicating significant growth in the service's global footprint. In 2024, the service maintained its reach at nearly 60 origin countries and over 190 destination countries, suggesting that FedEx had completed a major phase of international deployment for this e-commerce-focused offering. This trajectory indicates a deliberate and aggressive expansion into new markets, particularly in support of global e-commerce growth, followed by stabilization as the service reached a mature coverage level.",

          "chunk_text": "International express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of timedefinite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from nearly 200 countries and territories in one or two business days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Mexico. FedEx Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China, and South Africa. In addition, FedEx Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance.\n\nOur FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 20 countries and territories. Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual ecommerce service currently available from nearly 50 origin countries to over 130 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days.\n\nFor information regarding FedEx Express e-commerce tools and solutions, such as FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see 'FedEx Services Segment - Customer-Driven Technology - E-Commerce Solutions.'\n\n## International Expansion\n\nOver the years, FedEx Express has added capabilities in important international markets that have given us more robust transportation networks. Our 2016 acquisition of TNT Express accelerated our European and global growth; substantially enhanced our global footprint through TNT Express's lower-cost road networks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; and expanded our capabilities and solutions for our customers. The completion of the physical network integration of TNT Express into FedEx Express in 2022 and consolidation of flights into our Paris hub allow us to significantly improve operational efficiency. We are currently in the process of migrating customers from services offered by TNT Express to the FedEx Express portfolio of services. Additionally, we continue to execute initiatives to transform and optimize the FedEx Express international business, particularly in Europe. For more information regarding our international strategy and related costs, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report.\n\nWe also have expanded our capabilities in the Asia-Pacific markets, including through the establishment of our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China; our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which serves as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S.; and our International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport. During 2020, we added 14 new Asia-Pacific origin markets for FedEx International First service to the U.S. and Canada. These developments allow us to continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets.\n\nIn December 2021, FedEx Express entered into a strategic alliance with Delhivery, a leading logistics and supply chain services company in India. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\nTo facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.\n\n## U.S. Postal Service Agreement\n\nIn 2013, FedEx Express entered into a new seven-year agreement with the U.S. Postal Service ('USPS') under which FedEx Express provides airport-to-airport transportation of USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail within the U.S. In 2017, the parties entered into an amendment to the agreement whereby the initial renewal period provided in the agreement was exercised in part and the agreement's period of performance was extended through September 29, 2024. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS's international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Pricing\n\nFedEx Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 3, 2022, FedEx Express implemented a 5.9% average list price increase for U.S. domestic, U.S. export, and U.S. import services.",

Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual e-commerce service currently available from nearly 60 origin countries to over 190 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days.\n\n## Operations\n\nFederal Express's largest sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company's multiple hub-and-spoke system and worldwide air network. A second national air hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities to ex pand and modernize our Indianapolis hub and modernize our Memphis hub. See the 'Financial Condition - Liquidity Outlook' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information. In addition to these national air hubs, Federal Express operates regional air hubs in Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland, and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities at airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta.\n\nFacilities at airports in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, G uangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for ex press package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, G uangzhou, and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional air hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami serves our South Florida, Latin American, and Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large European markets. In addition to its worldwide air network, Federal Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and South America. Federal Express's unique European road network connects more than 45 countries and territories through 28 transit hubs and more than 600 stations.\n\nWith the recent significant growth of e-commerce and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are fundamentally redesigning our international air network in connection with our DRIVE transformation program. The redesigned network will continue to deploy FedEx-owned aircraft in the delivery of International Priority parcel shipments using our existing hub-and-spoke model. Additionally, a portion of our owned aircraft fleet will be retimed to operate off-cycle, allowing us to build density, decongest hubs, and connect our global surface networks. Finally, we will continue to leverage our global partner network as an adaptive capacity layer, particularly on imbalanced trade lanes, to move e-commerce and deferred volumes.\n\nThroughout its worldwide network, Federal Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers, and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station's service area. In some international areas, independent agents ('Global Service Participants') have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see 'Item 2. Properties' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Federal Express Segment.'\n\nFederal Express also operates a highly flexible surface network of over 700 legacy FedEx Ground sortation and distribution facilities, including 165 fully automated stations, as of June 7, 2024. Federal Ex press conducts these operations in the U.S. primarily with more than 95,000 motorized vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. Through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which we pick up, transport, and deliver packages in the U.S. and Canada, these operations are being consolidated into the surface operations of Federal Express. We have implemented Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and began the phased transition of all legacy FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to Federal Express surface operations in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, Federal Express will continue to utilize both its employee couriers and contracted service providers in U.S. surface operations using a market-by-market approach. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information on Network 2.0.\n\nFederal Express continues to maximize the use of existing U.S. surface facilities through Network 2.0. Many of these facilities utilize advanced automated unloading and sorting technology to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. This technology includes a yard management system in many facilities which interacts with GPS tags on trailers to automatically notify the control",

      "question": "How did the structure and specific terms of FedEx's Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA) evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in light of the May 2023 amendment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx's filings referenced the original terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA), which was dated August 13, 2020, and established a credit facility between Wilmington Trust Company (as Subordination Agent and Borrower) and BNP Paribas (as Liquidity Provider). By 2023, the agreement had undergone Amendment No. 1, dated May 22, 2023, indicating a modification to its terms\u2014though the specific nature of the amendment is not detailed in the provided evidence, its existence signals a formal adjustment to the agreement. In 2024, the Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA) was still being referenced in its amended form, demonstrating its continued relevance and operational role in FedEx\u2019s financial structure. This progression shows that while the core framework of the agreement remained intact, it was actively maintained and adapted through at least one formal amendment, ensuring its applicability to FedEx\u2019s evolving financial needs.",

        "Hop 1: [FDX](2022) \u2192 [Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA)]: The agreement is referenced in its original form, dated August 13, 2020, between Wilmington Trust Company and BNP Paribas.",

        "Hop 3: [FDX](2024) \u2192 [Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA)]: The agreement is still referenced, now in its amended form, showing continued use and relevance."

      "answer": "The financing arrangements for the 5.250% Note due 2050 remained structurally consistent across all three years, as the foundational documents\u2014including the Pass Through Trust Agreement, Trust Supplement No. 2020-1AA, and Indenture and Security Agreements\u2014were first filed in 2020 and referenced in all subsequent 10-K filings (2022, 2023, and 2024). However, in 2023, FedEx introduced Amendment No. 1, dated May 22, 2023, to the Liquidity Provider Revolving Credit Agreement, indicating a strategic update to liquidity management tied to the note. This amendment suggests FedEx adjusted its credit support mechanisms to better manage cash flow or respond to changing market conditions. The 2024 filing reaffirmed the ongoing validity and application of these amended agreements, showing continuity in execution and signaling a stabilized long-term financing strategy anchored by the 2050 note.",

      "answer": "The 1.300% Note due 2031 was consistently referenced across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, item 4.34), indicating it remained a stable component of FedEx\u2019s long-term debt structure. No amendments or new disclosures were introduced in 2023 or 2024 that altered its presentation or status. This static treatment suggests the Note continued to serve a foundational role in FedEx\u2019s capital structure without requiring modification or additional documentation during this period.",

      "question": "What does the evolution of FedEx's liquidity arrangements for the 4.250% Note due 2030 from 2022 to 2024 indicate about the company's approach to managing credit support for this obligation?",
      "answer": "The liquidity arrangements for the 4.250% Note due 2030 remained centered around the Revolving Credit Agreement (2020-1AA) with Wilmington Trust Company and BNP Paribas across all three years. In 2022, the foundational agreements were established, including the Intercreditor Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement dated August 13, 2020. In 2023, FedEx filed Amendment No. 1 to the Liquidity Provider Revolving Credit Agreement on May 22, 2023, indicating a proactive adjustment to the liquidity support structure. By 2024, the arrangement remained in place with no further amendments noted, suggesting that FedEx maintained a consistent credit support framework for the Note, with a single modification in 2023 to adapt to potential liquidity needs.",

      "question": "How did the geographic reach of FedEx International Connect Plus evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this expansion trajectory suggest about FedEx's strategic focus in the e-commerce logistics market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx International Connect Plus was available from nearly 50 origin countries to over 130 destination countries. By 2023, the service had expanded to nearly 60 origin countries and over 190 destination countries. This geographic footprint remained consistent in 2024, indicating a significant two-year expansion followed by stabilization. The trajectory suggests a strategic push by FedEx to capture global e-commerce logistics demand through enhanced international connectivity, particularly in emerging markets, followed by a phase of consolidation and optimization.",

          "chunk_text": "International express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of timedefinite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from nearly 200 countries and territories in one or two business days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Mexico. FedEx Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China, and South Africa. In addition, FedEx Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance.\n\nOur FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 20 countries and territories. Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual ecommerce service currently available from nearly 50 origin countries to over 130 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days.\n\nFor information regarding FedEx Express e-commerce tools and solutions, such as FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see 'FedEx Services Segment - Customer-Driven Technology - E-Commerce Solutions.'\n\n## International Expansion\n\nOver the years, FedEx Express has added capabilities in important international markets that have given us more robust transportation networks. Our 2016 acquisition of TNT Express accelerated our European and global growth; substantially enhanced our global footprint through TNT Express's lower-cost road networks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; and expanded our capabilities and solutions for our customers. The completion of the physical network integration of TNT Express into FedEx Express in 2022 and consolidation of flights into our Paris hub allow us to significantly improve operational efficiency. We are currently in the process of migrating customers from services offered by TNT Express to the FedEx Express portfolio of services. Additionally, we continue to execute initiatives to transform and optimize the FedEx Express international business, particularly in Europe. For more information regarding our international strategy and related costs, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report.\n\nWe also have expanded our capabilities in the Asia-Pacific markets, including through the establishment of our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China; our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which serves as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S.; and our International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport. During 2020, we added 14 new Asia-Pacific origin markets for FedEx International First service to the U.S. and Canada. These developments allow us to continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets.\n\nIn December 2021, FedEx Express entered into a strategic alliance with Delhivery, a leading logistics and supply chain services company in India. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\nTo facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.\n\n## U.S. Postal Service Agreement\n\nIn 2013, FedEx Express entered into a new seven-year agreement with the U.S. Postal Service ('USPS') under which FedEx Express provides airport-to-airport transportation of USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail within the U.S. In 2017, the parties entered into an amendment to the agreement whereby the initial renewal period provided in the agreement was exercised in part and the agreement's period of performance was extended through September 29, 2024. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS's international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Pricing\n\nFedEx Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 3, 2022, FedEx Express implemented a 5.9% average list price increase for U.S. domestic, U.S. export, and U.S. import services.",

Federal Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China, and South Africa. In addition, Federal Ex press offers comprehensive international ex press and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance.\n\nOur FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 25 countries and territories. Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual e-commerce service currently available from nearly 60 origin countries to over 190 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days.\n\n## Operations\n\nFederal Express's largest sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company's multiple hub-and-spoke system and worldwide air network. A second national air hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities to ex pand and modernize our Indianapolis hub and modernize our Memphis hub. See the 'Financial Condition - Liquidity Outlook' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information. In addition to these national air hubs, Federal Express operates regional air hubs in Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland, and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities at airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta.\n\nFacilities at airports in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, G uangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for ex press package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, G uangzhou, and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional air hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami serves our South Florida, Latin American, and Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large European markets. In addition to its worldwide air network, Federal Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and South America. Federal Express's unique European road network connects more than 45 countries and territories through 28 transit hubs and more than 600 stations.\n\nWith the recent significant growth of e-commerce and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are fundamentally redesigning our international air network in connection with our DRIVE transformation program. The redesigned network will continue to deploy FedEx-owned aircraft in the delivery of International Priority parcel shipments using our existing hub-and-spoke model. Additionally, a portion of our owned aircraft fleet will be retimed to operate off-cycle, allowing us to build density, decongest hubs, and connect our global surface networks. Finally, we will continue to leverage our global partner network as an adaptive capacity layer, particularly on imbalanced trade lanes, to move e-commerce and deferred volumes.\n\nThroughout its worldwide network, Federal Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers, and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station's service area. In some international areas, independent agents ('Global Service Participants') have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see 'Item 2. Properties' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Federal Express Segment.'\n\nFederal Express also operates a highly flexible surface network of over 700 legacy FedEx Ground sortation and distribution facilities, including 165 fully automated stations, as of June 7, 2024. Federal Ex press conducts these operations in the U.S. primarily with more than 95,000 motorized vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. Through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which we pick up, transport, and deliver packages in the U.S. and Canada, these operations are being consolidated into the surface operations of Federal Express. We have implemented Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and began the phased transition of all legacy FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to Federal Express surface operations in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, Federal Express will continue to utilize both its employee couriers and contracted service providers in U.S. surface operations using a market-by-market approach. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information on Network 2.0.\n\nFederal Express continues to maximize the use of existing U.S. surface facilities through Network 2.0. Many of these facilities utilize advanced automated unloading and sorting technology to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. This technology includes a yard management system in many facilities which interacts with GPS tags on trailers to automatically notify the control",

      "question": "How did FedEx's relationship with the 5.250% Note due 2050 evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of its documentation status, associated agreements, and any amendments introduced during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the 5.250% Note due 2050 was documented as part of Exhibit 4.2 to FedEx's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 7, 2020, and incorporated by reference into the 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, the documentation remained consistent, but an amendment (Amendment No. 1 dated May 22, 2023) was introduced to the Liquidity Provider Revolving Credit Agreement, which was directly tied to the broader financing structure supporting such notes. In 2024, the 5.250% Note due 2050 continued to be referenced under the same Exhibit 4.37, with the same foundational filing date, but the amendment from 2023 was now included in the updated exhibit list, indicating an evolution in the supporting credit arrangements. This progression shows that while the note itself remained unchanged, the broader financing framework around it was actively maintained and modified.",

        "Hop 2: FDX(2023) \u2192 5.250% Note due 2050: The note was again referenced in the same form and filing, but Amendment No. 1 (dated May 22, 2023) to the Liquidity Provider Revolving Credit Agreement was introduced, indicating a change in the financing structure around the note.",
        "Hop 3: FDX(2024) \u2192 5.250% Note due 2050: The note remained referenced in the same manner, but the 2024 filing now included the 2023 amendment as part of the updated exhibit list, showing that the amendment had become a formal part of the note\u2019s supporting documentation."

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's distribution strategy for reciprocating engines evolve from 2022 through 2024, as evidenced by changes in the number of distributors and geographic reach across its Perkins, FG Wilson, and MaK brands?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's distribution strategy for reciprocating engines demonstrated a pattern of geographic consolidation and brand-specific adjustments from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, Perkins Engines Company Limited operated through 90 distributors covering 171 countries, FG Wilson had 110 distributors in 109 countries, and MaK-branded engines utilized 20 distributors across 130 countries. By 2023, Perkins slightly reduced its distributor network to 88 distributors, yet expanded geographic coverage to 185 countries. This suggests a shift toward more concentrated distribution in fewer hands but broader international penetration. In 2024, while specific distributor numbers were not disclosed, the filings emphasized continued focus on integrated systems and electrified powertrain development for reciprocating engines, indicating a strategic pivot toward technological innovation alongside traditional distribution. The evolution reveals a dual strategy of geographic expansion with some distributor consolidation in 2023, followed by a technology-driven orientation in 2024.",

        "Hop 2: [CAT](2023) \u2192 Reciprocating Engines: Perkins reduced distributors to 88 but expanded to 185 countries, showing geographic prioritization over distributor count.",
        "Hop 3: [CAT](2024) \u2192 Reciprocating Engines: No specific distributor numbers, but the filing emphasized electrified powertrain and zero-emission engine development, signaling a strategic shift toward innovation."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. Operations and summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## A. Nature of operations\n\nInformation in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:\n\nMachinery, Energy &amp; Transportation (ME&amp;T) - We define ME&amp;T as Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. ME&amp;T's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\n\nFinancial  Products -  We  define  Financial  Products  as  our  finance  and  insurance  subsidiaries,  primarily  Caterpillar Financial  Services  Corporation  (Cat  Financial)  and  Caterpillar  Insurance  Holdings  Inc.  (Insurance  Services).  Financial Products' information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\n\nWe sell our products primarily under the brands 'Caterpillar,' 'CAT,' design versions of 'CAT' and 'Caterpillar,' 'EMD,' 'FG Wilson,' 'MaK,' 'MWM,' 'Perkins,' 'Progress Rail,' 'SEM' and 'Solar Turbines.'\n\nWe conduct operations in our ME&amp;T line of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers' service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\n\nWe distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 44 located in the United States and 116 located outside the United States, serving 193 countries.  We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 90 distributors covering 171 countries. We sell the FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems through its worldwide network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries.  We also sell some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers' principal business. We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives,  to  end  customers  through  sales  forces  employed  by  the  company. At  times,  these  employees  are  assisted  by independent sales representatives.\n\nThe Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar  products  is  available  through  a  variety  of  competitive  sources,  principally  commercial  banks  and  finance  and leasing  companies.  We  offer  various  financing,  insurance  and  risk  management  products  designed  to  support  sales  of  our products and generate financing income for our company. We conduct a significant portion of Financial Products activity in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n## B. Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.\n\nInvestments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nWe consolidate  all  variable  interest  entities  (VIEs)  where  Caterpillar  Inc.  is  the  primary  beneficiary.    For  VIEs,  we  assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs.  The primary beneficiary  of  a VIE  is  the  party  that  has  both  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Caterpillar's competitive positioning against Volvo Construction Equipment evolved through a strategic expansion of its product portfolio and deeper integration of autonomous technologies. In 2022, Caterpillar listed Volvo Construction Equipment as a global surface competitor and highlighted its broad product range including electric rope shovels, large mining trucks, and autonomous-ready vehicles. By 2023, Caterpillar emphasized its ability to control the integration and design of key machine components and innovative technologies as a competitive advantage, reinforcing its focus on autonomous machine capabilities and fleet management systems. In 2024, Caterpillar expanded its Resource Industries product portfolio to include wide-body trucks and material handlers, while continuing to position autonomous-ready vehicles and solutions as a core differentiator.

Nature of operations\n\nInformation in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:\n\nMachinery, Energy &amp; Transportation (ME&amp;T) - We define ME&amp;T as Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. ME&amp;T's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\n\nFinancial  Products -  We  define  Financial  Products  as  our  finance  and  insurance  subsidiaries,  primarily  Caterpillar Financial  Services  Corporation  (Cat  Financial)  and  Caterpillar  Insurance  Holdings  Inc.  (Insurance  Services).  Financial Products' information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\n\nWe sell our products primarily under the brands 'Caterpillar,' 'CAT,' design versions of 'CAT' and 'Caterpillar,' 'EMD,' 'FG Wilson,' 'MaK,' 'MWM,' 'Perkins,' 'Progress Rail,' 'SEM' and 'Solar Turbines.'\n\nWe conduct operations in our ME&amp;T line of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers' service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\n\nWe distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 44 located in the United States and 116 located outside the United States, serving 193 countries.  We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 90 distributors covering 171 countries. We sell the FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems through its worldwide network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries.  We also sell some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers' principal business. We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives,  to  end  customers  through  sales  forces  employed  by  the  company. At  times,  these  employees  are  assisted  by independent sales representatives.\n\nThe Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar  products  is  available  through  a  variety  of  competitive  sources,  principally  commercial  banks  and  finance  and leasing  companies.  We  offer  various  financing,  insurance  and  risk  management  products  designed  to  support  sales  of  our products and generate financing income for our company. We conduct a significant portion of Financial Products activity in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n## B. Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.\n\nInvestments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nWe consolidate  all  variable  interest  entities  (VIEs)  where  Caterpillar  Inc.  is  the  primary  beneficiary.    For  VIEs,  we  assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs.  The primary beneficiary  of  a VIE  is  the  party  that  has  both  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's exposure to and management of currency hedging instruments evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in response to LIBOR phase-out timelines and the adoption of SOFR as a benchmark, and what does this reveal about the company's strategic adaptation to global financial market reforms?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar highlighted its exposure to LIBOR-linked financial instruments through Cat Financial, noting the uncertainty around the phase-out of LIBOR and its potential impact on derivative valuations and borrowing costs. The company acknowledged the FCA's announcement to stop LIBOR after 2021 and IBA\u2019s plan to cease USD LIBOR on June 30, 2023 for most tenors. It also indicated it had formed a cross-functional team to assess LIBOR-related risks. By 2023, Caterpillar had transitioned its disclosures to emphasize the use of SOFR as a new benchmark in variable-rate loans and financing, and the company had expanded its cross-functional team to assess risks related to floating reference rates like SOFR. In 2024, the company no longer referenced LIBOR at all and focused entirely on SOFR, indicating a full strategic pivot away from LIBOR-based instruments. Throughout this period, Caterpillar consistently used currency hedging instruments to manage exchange rate risk, but the shift from LIBOR to SOFR demonstrates a proactive adaptation to evolving global financial standards. This evolution shows Caterpillar\u2019s strategic alignment with regulatory changes and market benchmarks, ensuring continued financial stability and risk mitigation.",

Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.  LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.  On November 18, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\"), the administrator of USD LIBOR, announced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, IBA, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While the November 30 announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established if LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or alternative reference rates to be established.  The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has created a cross-functional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial's borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.  With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.\n\n## An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\n\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis. However, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.\n\n## Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\n\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  We are subject to currency-exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.",

Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\n\n## Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\n\nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt  securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including  Cat  Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and sales and leaseback transactions, restrictions on the transfer of certain property and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger.
