      "question": "How did MetLife's use of the modified coinsurance agreement, specifically as it relates to the closed block, evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does the consistency in the percentage of risk transferred reveal about the company's long-term reinsurance strategy?",
      "answer": "MetLife consistently reinsured approximately 59% of the closed block through a modified coinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated third-party reinsurer across all three years: 59.25% in 2022, 59% in 2023, and again 59% in 2024. The company accounted for this agreement using the deposit method of accounting each year and exercised its right of offset, combining the modified coinsurance deposit liability with the deposit recoverable. Despite significant growth in total net ceded reinsurance recoverables from $6.3 billion in 2021 (referenced in 2022 filing) to $17.6 billion in 2024, the proportion of the closed block reinsured remained stable. This consistency suggests a deliberate and sustained reinsurance strategy focused on maintaining risk transfer efficiency and capital optimization for the closed block over the three-year period.",

Reinsurance (continued)\n\n## Catastrophe Coverage\n\nThe  Company  has  exposure  to  catastrophes  which  could  contribute  to  significant  fluctuations  in  the  Company's  results  of operations. For the U.S. and EMEA, the Company purchases catastrophe coverage to reinsure risks issued within territories that the Company believes are subject to the greatest catastrophic risks. For its other segments, the Company uses excess of retention and quota  share  reinsurance  agreements  to  provide  greater  diversification  of  risk  and  minimize  exposure  to  larger  risks.  Excess  of retention  reinsurance  agreements  provide  for  a  portion  of  a  risk  to  remain  with  the  direct  writing  company  and  quota  share reinsurance agreements provide for the direct writing company to transfer a fixed percentage of all risks of a class of policies.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverables\n\nThe Company reinsures its business through a diversified group of well-capitalized reinsurers. The Company analyzes recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with its reinsurers. The Company monitors ratings and evaluates the financial strength of its reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. The Company generally secures large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. These reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance, which at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were not significant. A U.S. life insurance subsidiary  of  the  Company  also  secured  collateral  from  its  counterparties  to  mitigate  counterparty  default  risk  related  to  its longevity reinsurance agreements.\n\nThe Company has secured certain reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. The Company had $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion of unsecured reinsurance recoverable balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $6.3 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total, $4.1 billion, or 65%, were with the Company's five largest ceded reinsurers, including $1.9 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $6.6 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total, $4.2 billion, or 64%, were with the Company's five largest ceded reinsurers, including $2.0 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured.\n\nThe  Company  has  reinsured  with  an  unaffiliated  third-party  reinsurer,  59.25%  of  the  closed  block  through  a  modified coinsurance agreement. The Company accounts for this agreement under the deposit method of accounting. The Company, having the right of offset, has offset the modified coinsurance deposit with the deposit recoverable.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife utilized commercial paper as a key component of its short-term debt strategy, with MetLife Funding raising cash through this program to extend loans to affiliates and enhance financial flexibility. In 2023, the company reaffirmed its diversified funding approach, listing commercial paper as a core source of short-term liquidity while emphasizing confidence in counterparty reliability. In 2024, MetLife maintained the same structure, continuing to rely on commercial paper within its broader short-term debt framework, again noting that commitments under credit facilities may expire unused.

The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc.'s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Sources\n\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in '- Summary of the Company's Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,' the Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\n\n## Global Funding Sources\n\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit and committed facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, the collateral  financing arrangement, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. MetLife, Inc. maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and  hybrid  securities.  As  a  'Well-Known  Seasoned  Issuer'  under  SEC  rules,  MetLife,  Inc.'s  shelf  registration  statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility,  limits  dependence  on  any  one  market  or  source  of  funds  and  generally  lowers  the  cost  of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on preferred stock issuances.\n\n## Common Stock\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt\n\nMetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding each have a commercial paper program that is supported by our unsecured revolving credit facility (see '- Credit and Committed Facilities'). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.\n\n## FHLB Advance Agreements, Reported in Liabilities Held-for-Sale\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  we  borrowed  $0  and  $2.8  billion,  respectively,  and  repaid  $700 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, under advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, total obligations outstanding under these advance agreements were $0 and $700 million, respectively.\n\n## Policyholder Account Balances\n\nSee  Notes  1  and  4  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a  description  of  the  components  of policyholder  account  balances.  See  '-  Insurance  Liabilities'  regarding  the  source  and  uncertainties  associated  with  the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\n\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $248.6 billion ($29.5 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amount of $203.5 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\n\nThe estimated cash flows represent cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges;  annuitization;  mortality;  future  interest  credited;  policy  loans  and  other  contingent  events  as  appropriate  for  the respective  product  type.  Such  estimated  cash  payments  are  also  presented  net  of  estimated  future  premiums  on  policies currently  in-force  and  gross  of  any  reinsurance  recoverable.

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nOther invested assets consist principally of the following:\n\n- Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in '- Derivatives' below.\n- Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax  credits  or  other  tax  incentives.  Where  tax  credits  are  guaranteed  by  a  creditworthy  third  party,  the  investment  is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 19.\n- Annuities funding structured settlement claims represent annuities funding claims assumed by the Company in its capacity as  a  structured  settlements  assignment  company.  The  annuities  are  stated  at  their  contract  value,  which  represents  the present  value  of  the  future  periodic  claim  payments  to  be  provided. The  net  investment  income  recognized  reflects  the amortization of discount of the annuity at its implied effective interest rate.\n- Direct financing leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value,  less  the  unearned  income,  less ACL.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the  pre-tax  internal  rate  of  return  to  the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation.\n- Leveraged leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less  the  unearned  income,  less  ACL  and  is  reported  net  of  non-recourse  debt.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the leveraged lease's estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease in those periods in which the net investment at the beginning of the period is positive. Leveraged leases derive investment returns in part from their income tax benefit. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments.\n- Investments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method.\n- Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ('FHLB') common stock are carried at redemption value and are considered restricted  investments  until  redeemed  by  the  respective  regional  FHLBs.  Dividends  are  recognized  in  net  investment income when declared.\n- Funds  withheld  represent  a  receivable  for  amounts  contractually  withheld  by  ceding  companies  in  accordance  with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions and Repurchase Agreements\n\nThe Company accounts for securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as financing arrangements and the associated  liability  is  recorded  at  the  amount  of  cash  received.  The  securities  loaned  or  sold  under  these  agreements  are included in invested assets. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements are recognized as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  securities  lending  transactions,  whereby  securities  are  loaned  to  unaffiliated  financial institutions. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan.",

      "question": "How did MetLife's use of the deposit method of accounting for reinsurance agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of deposit assets and liabilities, and what does this multi-year trend suggest about the company's reinsurance strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported deposit assets and liabilities on reinsurance at $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, indicating a relatively modest use of the deposit method. By 2023, the company had not disclosed specific figures but emphasized its criteria for applying the deposit method, signaling a strategic and selective approach to reinsurance accounting. In 2024, the company significantly increased its use of the deposit method, with deposit assets rising to $4.6 billion and liabilities at $1.2 billion, reflecting a major reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that involved $10.3 billion in reinsurance recoverables and deposit receivables. This three-year progression reveals a strategic pivot toward leveraging reinsurance agreements under the deposit method to manage risk exposure and capital allocation, particularly for blocks of life insurance and annuity products.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n\n## 6. Reinsurance (continued)\n\nReinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance were $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The deposit liabilities on reinsurance were $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 7. Closed Block\n\nOn April 7, 2000 (the 'Demutualization Date'), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ('MLIC') converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC's plan of reorganization, as amended (the 'Plan of Reorganization'). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and projected experience against the experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in experience.\n\nThe closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and other experience related to the closed block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed block policyholders in the future  may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend  scales  in  effect  for  1999  had  been  continued.  Any  cash  flows  in  excess  of  amounts  assumed  will  be  available  for distribution over time to closed block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over 100 years from the Demutualization Date.\n\nThe Company uses the same accounting principles to account for the participating policies included in the closed block as it used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represents the estimated maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result from operations, attributed net of income tax, to the closed block. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes  that  over  time  the  actual  cumulative  earnings  of  the  closed  block  will  approximately  equal  the  expected  cumulative earnings  due  to  the  effect  of  dividend  changes.  If,  over  the  period  the  closed  block  remains  in  existence,  the  actual  cumulative earnings of the closed block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess to  closed  block  policyholders  as  additional  policyholder  dividends  unless  offset  by  future  unfavorable  experience  of  the  closed block and, accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings.\n\nExperience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed  block,  is  based  upon  cumulative  actual  and  expected  earnings  within  the  closed  block. Accordingly,  the  Company's  net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block.\n\nClosed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.",

The net cost of reinsurance will be amortized on a basis consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used for amortizing DAC related to the underlying reinsured contracts in policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nAs part of this transaction, the Company's institutional investment management business entered into investment advisory and other agreements with subsidiaries of Global Atlantic to serve as the investment manager for certain of the transferred general account assets.

      "answer": "MetLife consistently used internally developed designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS when NAIC designations were not yet available, but the context around this practice evolved. In 2022, the NAIC had distinct modeling methodologies based on issuance date (pre- and post-January 1, 2013), which affected how internally developed designations were applied. In 2023, MetLife disclosed a 14.5% increase in Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS, indicating a growing need for internally developed designations as new securities entered the portfolio. By 2024, the growth in Level 3 securities had slowed to 4.9%, suggesting either a stabilization in new acquisitions or an improvement in the timeliness of NAIC evaluations. This 3-year trend shows a gradually decreasing reliance on internal designations, implying that NAIC processes may have become more responsive to the evolving market conditions.",

Prior to December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology incorporated the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) without regard to the issuance date. As of December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized  cost;  while  for  non-agency  RMBS  and  CMBS  issued  after  January  1,  2013,  the  modeling  methodology  does  not incorporate the amortized cost of the security. The NAIC's objective with the modeling methodology is to increase accuracy in estimating expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.\n\nEffective  December  31,  2020,  the  NAIC  implemented  20  'NAIC  designation  categories'  which  is  an  additional,  more granular  credit  quality  categorization.  These  NAIC  designation  categories  correspond  more  closely  to  the  NRSRO's  alphanumeric credit quality ratings. Effective December 31, 2021, the NAIC implemented new unique RBC factors for each of the 20 NAIC designation categories. The NAIC's goal is to better align RBC charges on securities with the instruments' actual credit risk.\n\nRating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's Investors Service ('Moody's'), S&amp;P, Fitch Ratings ('Fitch'), DBRS Morningstar, A.M. Best Company ('A.M. Best'), Kroll Bond Rating Agency and Egan Jones Ratings Company. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\n\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, held by MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries  that  maintain  the  NAIC  statutory  basis  of  accounting,  which  are  presented  using  NAIC designations for modeled securities. NRSRO ratings and NAIC designations are as of the dates shown below. Over time, credit ratings can migrate, up or down, through the NRSRO's and NAIC's continuous monitoring process.\n\n",

During the year ended December 31, 2024, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by $1.6 billion, or 4.9%. The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales, partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 in ex cess of transfers into Level 3 and a decrease in estimated fair value recognized in OCI.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality - Ratings\n\nThe Securities V aluation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity securities of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. The NAIC assigns securities  to  one  of  six   credit  quality  categories  defined  as  'NAIC  designations.'  In  general,  securities  with  NAIC  designations  of  1  and  2  are  considered investment grade and securities with NAIC designations of 3 through 6 are considered below investment grade. If no NAIC designation is available, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used.\n\nNAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS are based on a modeling methodology that estimates security level expected losses under a variety of economic scenarios. The modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost; while for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued after January 1, 2013, the modeling  methodology  does  not  incorporate  the  amortized  cost  of  the  security.

      "question": "How did MetLife's dependence on global funding markets evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its reliance on short-term debt instruments like commercial paper and the diversity of its capital sources?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MetLife consistently emphasized the diversity of its global funding sources as a strategic advantage that limits overreliance on any single market or funding mechanism. In 2022, the company highlighted its use of commercial paper programs, supported by unsecured revolving credit facilities, to provide liquidity to affiliates via internal loans. By 2023, MetLife reiterated this diversified funding model, noting that it includes preferred and common stock, short-term and long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements, and public debt issuance through a shelf registration with no stated capacity. In 2024, the company maintained the same structure, underscoring its confidence in funding flexibility and cost efficiency. Despite this consistency, the repeated emphasis on market dependence as a risk factor suggests that while MetLife has managed to maintain diversified access, its capital structure remains inherently tied to the stability and accessibility of global financial markets.",

The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc.'s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Sources\n\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in '- Summary of the Company's Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,' the Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\n\n## Global Funding Sources\n\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit and committed facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, the collateral  financing arrangement, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. MetLife, Inc. maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and  hybrid  securities.  As  a  'Well-Known  Seasoned  Issuer'  under  SEC  rules,  MetLife,  Inc.'s  shelf  registration  statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity.

See  '-  Insurance  Liabilities'  regarding  the  source  and  uncertainties  associated  with  the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\n\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $248.6 billion ($29.5 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amount of $203.5 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\n\nThe estimated cash flows represent cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges;  annuitization;  mortality;  future  interest  credited;  policy  loans  and  other  contingent  events  as  appropriate  for  the respective  product  type.

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nOther invested assets consist principally of the following:\n\n- Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in '- Derivatives' below.\n- Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax  credits  or  other  tax  incentives.  Where  tax  credits  are  guaranteed  by  a  creditworthy  third  party,  the  investment  is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 19.\n- Annuities funding structured settlement claims represent annuities funding claims assumed by the Company in its capacity as  a  structured  settlements  assignment  company.  The  annuities  are  stated  at  their  contract  value,  which  represents  the present  value  of  the  future  periodic  claim  payments  to  be  provided. The  net  investment  income  recognized  reflects  the amortization of discount of the annuity at its implied effective interest rate.\n- Direct financing leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value,  less  the  unearned  income,  less ACL.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the  pre-tax  internal  rate  of  return  to  the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation.\n- Leveraged leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less  the  unearned  income,  less  ACL  and  is  reported  net  of  non-recourse  debt.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the leveraged lease's estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease in those periods in which the net investment at the beginning of the period is positive. Leveraged leases derive investment returns in part from their income tax benefit. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments.\n- Investments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method.\n- Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ('FHLB') common stock are carried at redemption value and are considered restricted  investments  until  redeemed  by  the  respective  regional  FHLBs.  Dividends  are  recognized  in  net  investment income when declared.\n- Funds  withheld  represent  a  receivable  for  amounts  contractually  withheld  by  ceding  companies  in  accordance  with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions and Repurchase Agreements\n\nThe Company accounts for securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as financing arrangements and the associated  liability  is  recorded  at  the  amount  of  cash  received.  The  securities  loaned  or  sold  under  these  agreements  are included in invested assets. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements are recognized as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  securities  lending  transactions,  whereby  securities  are  loaned  to  unaffiliated  financial institutions. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan.",

      "question": "How did MetLife's use of the deposit method of accounting for reinsurance agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the trend in deposit assets and liabilities reveal about the company's reinsurance strategy and risk exposure over time?",
      "answer": "MetLife's use of the deposit method of accounting for reinsurance agreements showed a measurable increase in both deposit assets and liabilities from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, deposit assets and liabilities on reinsurance were $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. By 2023, the company disclosed a broader accounting framework that included the use of the deposit method for reinsurance agreements lacking sufficient insurance risk transfer, and in 2024, deposit assets and liabilities were $4.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward more reinsurance arrangements that do not fully transfer insurance risk, likely reflecting a broader risk management or capital optimization strategy. The significant increase in deposit assets from 2023 to 2024, particularly following the Global Atlantic transaction, suggests a growing reliance on reinsurance structures that maintain balance sheet flexibility while transferring certain obligations.",

        "Hop 1: MET(2023) \u2192 Deposit Method of Accounting: Discloses accounting policy for reinsurance agreements, including the use of the deposit method when there is insufficient insurance risk transfer.",

        "Hop 3: MET(2022) \u2192 Deposit Method of Accounting: Discloses $1.8 billion in deposit assets and $1.4 billion in deposit liabilities, indicating a much smaller use of the deposit method at that time."

Reinsurance (continued)\n\nReinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance were $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The deposit liabilities on reinsurance were $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 7. Closed Block\n\nOn April 7, 2000 (the 'Demutualization Date'), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ('MLIC') converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC's plan of reorganization, as amended (the 'Plan of Reorganization'). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and projected experience against the experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in experience.\n\nThe closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and other experience related to the closed block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed block policyholders in the future  may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend  scales  in  effect  for  1999  had  been  continued.  Any  cash  flows  in  excess  of  amounts  assumed  will  be  available  for distribution over time to closed block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over 100 years from the Demutualization Date.\n\nThe Company uses the same accounting principles to account for the participating policies included in the closed block as it used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represents the estimated maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result from operations, attributed net of income tax, to the closed block. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes  that  over  time  the  actual  cumulative  earnings  of  the  closed  block  will  approximately  equal  the  expected  cumulative earnings  due  to  the  effect  of  dividend  changes.  If,  over  the  period  the  closed  block  remains  in  existence,  the  actual  cumulative earnings of the closed block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess to  closed  block  policyholders  as  additional  policyholder  dividends  unless  offset  by  future  unfavorable  experience  of  the  closed block and, accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings.\n\nExperience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed  block,  is  based  upon  cumulative  actual  and  expected  earnings  within  the  closed  block. Accordingly,  the  Company's  net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block.\n\nClosed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.",

      "answer": "MetLife's reliance on internally developed designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS decreased over the three-year period as the NAIC's modeling methodology became more established and widely applied. In 2022, MetLife noted that internally developed designations were used for newly acquired non-agency RMBS and CMBS until NAIC designations became available, indicating a transitional phase in the adoption of the NAIC's updated modeling methodology, which was refined as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, the company continued to use internally developed designations for newly acquired securities but emphasized a more mature application of the NAIC's credit quality framework, with Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increasing by $4.2 billion (14.5%). In 2024, the use of internally developed designations remained consistent with prior years, but the growth in Level 3 securities slowed to $1.6 billion (4.9%), suggesting that more securities had received formal NAIC designations over time. This trend indicates a gradual shift away from reliance on internal designations toward standardized NAIC assessments, aligning with the NAIC's goal of improving accuracy in expected loss estimation and RBC charge determination.",

During the year ended December 31, 2024, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by $1.6 billion, or 4.9%. The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales, partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 in ex cess of transfers into Level 3 and a decrease in estimated fair value recognized in OCI.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality - Ratings\n\nThe Securities V aluation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity securities of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. The NAIC assigns securities  to  one  of  six   credit  quality  categories  defined  as  'NAIC  designations.'  In  general,  securities  with  NAIC  designations  of  1  and  2  are  considered investment grade and securities with NAIC designations of 3 through 6 are considered below investment grade. If no NAIC designation is available, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used.\n\nNAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS are based on a modeling methodology that estimates security level expected losses under a variety of economic scenarios. The modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost; while for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued after January 1, 2013, the modeling  methodology  does  not  incorporate  the  amortized  cost  of  the  security.  The  NAIC's  objective  with  the  modeling  methodology  is  to  increase  accuracy  in estimating expected losses and recovery value, and to use this credit quality assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for our non-agency RMBS and CMBS in our disclosures below. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When we acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.",

Prior to December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology incorporated the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) without regard to the issuance date. As of December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized  cost;  while  for  non-agency  RMBS  and  CMBS  issued  after  January  1,  2013,  the  modeling  methodology  does  not incorporate the amortized cost of the security. The NAIC's objective with the modeling methodology is to increase accuracy in estimating expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.\n\nEffective  December  31,  2020,  the  NAIC  implemented  20  'NAIC  designation  categories'  which  is  an  additional,  more granular  credit  quality  categorization.  These  NAIC  designation  categories  correspond  more  closely  to  the  NRSRO's  alphanumeric credit quality ratings. Effective December 31, 2021, the NAIC implemented new unique RBC factors for each of the 20 NAIC designation categories. The NAIC's goal is to better align RBC charges on securities with the instruments' actual credit risk.\n\nRating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's Investors Service ('Moody's'), S&amp;P, Fitch Ratings ('Fitch'), DBRS Morningstar, A.M. Best Company ('A.M. Best'), Kroll Bond Rating Agency and Egan Jones Ratings Company.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or ex port controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nWe expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, taking over customer accounts or creating fraudulent accounts, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our products and services into engaging in fraudulent transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal's digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical\n\n23",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to margin risk evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to its control over pricing, use of third-party payment processors, and transaction expense recognition?",
      "answer": "Across the three years, PayPal consistently bore full margin risk when completing payment transactions, with explicit acknowledgment in all filings that it recognized fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions as transaction expense. In 2022, the company emphasized its discretion in setting fees independent of incurred costs. In 2023, it reiterated this exposure and clarified that tiered pricing based on volume did not constitute a future material right. In 2024, PayPal again confirmed its principal role in transactions, maintaining that it bears full margin risk and continues to recognize fees paid to processors as transaction expense, despite the adoption of new segment reporting disclosures. This shows a consistent exposure to margin risk without structural changes in how it recognizes transaction costs or pricing control.",

The  amended  guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024.  For additional information, see 'Note 18-Segment Information.'\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform, which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV ').  We  generate  additional  revenues  from  merchants  and  consumers:  on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes.  We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable.

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to bad transactions through its BNPL loan receivables evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in light of its June 2023 agreement to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL receivables, and what does this reveal about the company's risk mitigation strategy over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal highlighted its exposure to bad transactions through its credit and merchant financing products, including the risk of defaults and the impact of fraud and abusive behaviors on its loss rate. In 2023, PayPal entered into a multi-year agreement in June to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, signaling a strategic move to reduce its exposure to bad transactions by offloading a substantial portion of its BNPL portfolio. By 2024, PayPal continued to emphasize the risks associated with bad transactions but noted that the sale of BNPL receivables was subject to certain conditions, and if not satisfied, could delay the expected benefits. This evolution shows PayPal's increasing focus on mitigating bad transaction risk through asset sales and forward-flow arrangements, while still acknowledging the ongoing challenges of fraud and abuse in its digital payments ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or ex port controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nWe expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, taking over customer accounts or creating fraudulent accounts, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our products and services into engaging in fraudulent transactions.

Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers online or offline, including mobile. We drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and offline. Our PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards. Our PayPal- and V enmo-branded debit and credit cards give consumers the ability to transact in-person through our platform and earn incentives, including cash-back rewards.\n\nWe also offer consumers person-to-person ('P2P') payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, V enmo, and Xoom products and services. Our V enmo digital wallet in the United States ('U.S.') is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment.\n\nWe offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom ('U.K.'), France, and G ermany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interestbearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in G ermany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and V enmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network.\n\nWe generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. We also earn revenue from interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\n\n## Merchant value proposition\n\nMerchants use our solutions to increase conversion rates and grow and manage their business. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to utilize our various products. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business.\n\nOur PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. These seamless experiences reduce cart abandonment and drive higher conversion rates for merchants. Our buy now, pay later solutions are embedded into our branded checkout experiences, which can help increase consumer spend and enable merchants to grow sales.\n\nOur unbranded payments processing solutions, which includes Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments, allow merchants to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online with a variety of popular ways to pay, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, PayPal Pay Later, and local payment methods.\n\nWe offer a suite of value added services, including payouts, payments orchestration, and fraud prevention and risk management solutions that help reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs. We also offer omnichannel solutions that allow merchants to make sales in person using our Zettle by PayPal app, card reader, or point of sale systems.\n\n6",

Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:\n\n- Growing our core business : through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers' use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing, and moving money, creating seamless checkout experiences, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;\n- Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers :  by being technology and platform agnostic, partnering with our  merchants  to  grow  and  expand  their  business  online  and  in-store,  and  providing  consumers  with  simple,  secure,  and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms and simplifying their shopping experiences;\n- Forming strategic partnerships : by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments ecosystem; and\n- Seeking  new  areas  of  growth :  organically  and  through  acquisitions  and  strategic  investments  in  our  existing  and  new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation in both the digital and physical world.\n\n## ESG MANAGEMENT\n\nPayPal  is  committed  to  creating  a  more  inclusive  global  economy  and  advancing  our  core  values  of  Collaboration,  Inclusion, Innovation,  and  Wellness  across  our  communities,  workforce,  and  strategies.  We  manage  priority  ESG  risks  and  opportunities through  four  key  pillars:  (1)  social  innovation,  (2)  employees  and  culture,  (3)  environmental  sustainability,  and  (4)  responsible business  practices.  We  believe  this  integrated,  enterprise-wide  approach  to  managing  our  global  business  responsibly  helps  to enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders, including our employees, stockholders, partners, and communities. In 2021, we continued to advance our ESG strategy, including through the following: a science-based approach to reducing our climate change impacts,  targeted  investments  to  address  the  racial  wealth  gap  and  empower  underserved  communities  and  businesses, programmatic development intended to foster an inclusive culture across the employee lifecycle, and ongoing enhancements to support  the  safety  and  security  of  our  products  and  platform.  We  take  this  commitment  seriously  and  endeavor  to  provide transparent disclosures on the progress of this work through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications.\n\n## TECHNOLOGY\n\nOur  payments  platform  utilizes  a  combination  of  proprietary  and  third-party  technologies  and  services  intended  to  facilitate transactions efficiently and securely between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our payments platform connects with financial service providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our payments platform can send payments in more than 200 markets around the world and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies, and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies.\n\nA transaction on our payments platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us, including a merchant, a consumer, and the  consumer's  funding  source  provider.  We  have  developed  intuitive  user  interfaces,  customer  tools,  transaction  completion databases, and network applications on our payments platform designed to enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our payments platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers' information.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to abusive behaviors evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its credit products, cross-border trade, and third-party risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's exposure to abusive behaviors remained a consistent risk factor, but the company's disclosures evolved in terms of specificity and strategic response. In 2022, PayPal highlighted the growing risk of fraud through fictitious accounts and stolen financial instruments, particularly in its U.S. credit products with Synchrony Bank and international credit extensions. In 2023, the company expanded on this risk in the context of its European BNPL products, disclosing a \u20ac40 billion forward-flow arrangement for loan receivables, which introduced additional exposure to abusive behaviors in high-volume credit origination. By 2024, PayPal emphasized the scale and sophistication of fraud attacks, noting that third parties were increasingly using synthetic identities and account takeovers, particularly in cross-border transactions and digital payment services. The company also indicated that its reliance on third-party processors and custodians added complexity to detecting and mitigating these behaviors. The trajectory shows a transformation from a general concern in 2022 to a more nuanced and operationally embedded risk by 2024, with increasing emphasis on digital fraud at scale.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nobligations and require us to change our business practices.\n\nWe are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk  of  potential  charge-offs  or  negative  impact  to  revenue  share  arrangement  with  Synchrony  Bank  with  respect  to  our  U.S. consumer  credit  product.  The  non-payment  rate  among  account  holders  may  increase  due  to,  among  other  factors,  changes  to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as  a  recession  or  government  austerity  programs,  increases  in  prevailing  interest  rates,  and  high  unemployment  rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our PayPal branded merchant financing offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer  and  merchants  products  outside  the  U.S.  through  our  international  subsidiaries.  If  we  are  unable  to  fund  our  credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor information on lending regulations that impact our business, see ' Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business -Lending Regulation ' in this risk factor section.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to  originate  our  U.S.  credit  products  to  consumers,  U.S.  merchant  financing,  and  branded  credit  card  products;  PayPalbranded  debit  card  products  issued  by  an  unaffiliated  bank;  cryptocurrency  custodial  service  providers;  and  external  business partners  and  contractors  who  provide  key  functions  (e.g.,  outsourced  customer  support  and  product  development  functions; facilities;  information  technology,  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing). These  risks  include  legal,  regulatory,  information security,  reputational,  operational,  or  any  other  risks  inherent  in  engaging  and  relying  upon  a  third-party.  If  we  are  unable  to effectively  manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial  disruptions  in  these  relationships,  our  operations,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  results  could  be  adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree  of  control  over  business  operations,  governance,  and  compliance,  thereby  potentially  increasing  our  financial,  legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that  take  place  within  a  single  country  or  market.  In  certain  markets,  cross-border  trade  represents  our  primary  (and  in  some instances our only) presence.\n\nCross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nThird parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information,  making  transactions  with  stolen  financial  instruments,  abusing  or  misusing  our  services  for  financial  gain,  or fraudulently  inducing  users  of  our  systems  into  engaging  in  bad  transactions.  Due  to  the  nature  of  PayPal's  digital  payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or ex port controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nWe expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, taking over customer accounts or creating fraudulent accounts, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our products and services into engaging in fraudulent transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal's digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical\n\n23",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to margin risk evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to its transaction pricing model, use of payment processors, and contract structure changes across those years?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's exposure to margin risk remained consistent in its core description \u2014 the company continued to bear full margin risk when completing payment transactions, recognizing fees on a gross basis and paying third-party processors as transaction expense. However, in 2023, PayPal added language clarifying how incentives provided to users were recognized as a reduction of revenue based on performance targets or amortized over the contractual term, which introduced more variability into its margin structure. In 2024, PayPal adopted new segment reporting disclosures under ASU 2023-07, which increased transparency around segment-level expenses, potentially affecting how margin risk is analyzed across business units. Despite these changes, the fundamental pricing model \u2014 tiered, volume-based pricing without material rights \u2014 remained unchanged, suggesting margin risk exposure was structurally stable but operationally nuanced over the three-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PYPL](2022) \u2192 [Margin Risk]: In 2022, PayPal explicitly stated it bears full margin risk when completing payment transactions, with fees recognized gross and third-party processor costs as transaction expense.",
        "Hop 2: [PYPL](2023) \u2192 [Margin Risk]: In 2023, PayPal expanded on how incentives to users were recognized as a reduction of revenue, introducing variability in realized margins based on performance and contractual terms.",
        "Hop 3: [PYPL](2024) \u2192 [Margin Risk]: In 2024, PayPal adopted ASU 2023-07, enhancing segment-level expense disclosures, which allows for deeper analysis of margin risk by business unit, though the structural margin exposure remained unchanged."

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n## Recent accounting guidance\n\nIn  2020,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ('FASB')  issued  ASU  2020-04, Reference  Rate  Reform (Topic  848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers  on  our  payments  platform  and  from  other  value  added  services.  Our  revenues  are  classified  into  two  categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a  fixed  and  variable  component. The  variable  component  is  generally  a  percentage  of  the  value  of  the  payment  amount  and  is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement  when  the  underlying  transaction  is  approved  for  a  refund.  We  estimate  the  amount  of  fee  refunds  that  will  be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform,  which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV').  We  earn  additional  fees  on transactions  where  we  perform  currency  conversion,  when  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already  provided.  Our  contracts  generally  renew  automatically  without  any  significant  material  rights.  Some  of  our  contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs and we do not carry any material contract balances.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using  our  risk  assessment  tools,  we  perform  a  transaction  risk  assessment  on  individual  transactions  to  determine  whether  a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of  completing  a  payment  transaction. As  a  principal  to  the  transaction,  we  control  the  service  of  completing  payments  on  our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n## Recently adopted accounting guidance\n\nIn  November  2023,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2023-07, Segment  Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to  Reportable  Segment  Disclosures .  The  amended  guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024.  For additional information, see 'Note 18-Segment Information.'\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform, which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV ').  We  generate  additional  revenues  from  merchants  and  consumers:  on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes.  We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's (PYPL) financial obligations related to its Fixed-rate 2.850% notes evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's long-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "PayPal's financial obligations related to the Fixed-rate 2.850% notes remained consistent at $1.5 billion across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024), indicating that the company did not reduce or refinance this particular tranche of debt during the period. In 2022, the note was part of a $5.0 billion September 2019 issuance and was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2029, with an effective interest rate of 2.96%. This maturity date and carrying amount remained unchanged in 2023 and 2024, despite active debt issuance and refinancing activity in other tranches during those years. The lack of change in this obligation suggests that PayPal prioritized refinancing or issuing new debt with different maturities and rates, while maintaining its exposure to the 2.850% notes. This reflects a strategy of preserving capital structure stability in certain long-term liabilities while adapting to changing interest environments in other areas.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to 'bad transactions' risk evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its U.S. credit products, European BNPL receivables sales, and third-party fraud schemes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal highlighted risks related to bad transactions stemming from fraud, including stolen identities and financial instruments, particularly in its U.S. credit products offered in partnership with Synchrony Bank. In 2023, PayPal entered a multi-year agreement to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, signaling a strategic shift to reduce exposure to bad transactions in its European credit portfolio. By 2024, PayPal continued to emphasize fraud risks, noting new threats such as account takeovers and synthetic identities, while also facing regulatory uncertainty regarding the 'valid-when-made' doctrine impacting U.S. credit products. The evolution shows a transition from internal risk management in 2022 to proactive portfolio divestiture in 2023 and continued vulnerability to evolving fraud tactics in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nobligations and require us to change our business practices.\n\nWe are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk  of  potential  charge-offs  or  negative  impact  to  revenue  share  arrangement  with  Synchrony  Bank  with  respect  to  our  U.S. consumer  credit  product.  The  non-payment  rate  among  account  holders  may  increase  due  to,  among  other  factors,  changes  to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as  a  recession  or  government  austerity  programs,  increases  in  prevailing  interest  rates,  and  high  unemployment  rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our PayPal branded merchant financing offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer  and  merchants  products  outside  the  U.S.  through  our  international  subsidiaries.  If  we  are  unable  to  fund  our  credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor information on lending regulations that impact our business, see ' Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business -Lending Regulation ' in this risk factor section.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to  originate  our  U.S.  credit  products  to  consumers,  U.S.  merchant  financing,  and  branded  credit  card  products;  PayPalbranded  debit  card  products  issued  by  an  unaffiliated  bank;  cryptocurrency  custodial  service  providers;  and  external  business partners  and  contractors  who  provide  key  functions  (e.g.,  outsourced  customer  support  and  product  development  functions; facilities;  information  technology,  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing). These  risks  include  legal,  regulatory,  information security,  reputational,  operational,  or  any  other  risks  inherent  in  engaging  and  relying  upon  a  third-party.  If  we  are  unable  to effectively  manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial  disruptions  in  these  relationships,  our  operations,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  results  could  be  adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree  of  control  over  business  operations,  governance,  and  compliance,  thereby  potentially  increasing  our  financial,  legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that  take  place  within  a  single  country  or  market.  In  certain  markets,  cross-border  trade  represents  our  primary  (and  in  some instances our only) presence.\n\nCross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nThird parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information,  making  transactions  with  stolen  financial  instruments,  abusing  or  misusing  our  services  for  financial  gain,  or fraudulently  inducing  users  of  our  systems  into  engaging  in  bad  transactions.  Due  to  the  nature  of  PayPal's  digital  payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or ex port controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nWe expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, taking over customer accounts or creating fraudulent accounts, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our products and services into engaging in fraudulent transactions.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's strategic emphasis on seamless checkout experiences evolved from a general commitment to innovation and customer value to a more concrete and feature-rich implementation across its consumer and merchant platforms. In 2022, PayPal described creating seamless checkout experiences as part of its core growth strategy, focusing on expanding adoption among merchants and consumers. By 2023, the company had expanded this focus to include simplifying shopping experiences and forming deeper strategic partnerships to reinforce its role in the payments ecosystem. In 2024, PayPal demonstrated tangible execution of this strategy by offering detailed consumer-facing tools such as PayPal and Venmo branded checkouts that allow purchases in just a few steps, along with features like product discovery, price tracking, and package tracking. This evolution indicates PayPal's increasing prioritization of user experience and engagement as a driver for both consumer satisfaction and merchant success, particularly through omnichannel integration and embedded financial tools like buy now, pay later.",

Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers online or offline, including mobile. We drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and offline. Our PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards. Our PayPal- and V enmo-branded debit and credit cards give consumers the ability to transact in-person through our platform and earn incentives, including cash-back rewards.\n\nWe also offer consumers person-to-person ('P2P') payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, V enmo, and Xoom products and services. Our V enmo digital wallet in the United States ('U.S.') is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment.\n\nWe offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom ('U.K.'), France, and G ermany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interestbearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in G ermany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and V enmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network.\n\nWe generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. We also earn revenue from interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\n\n## Merchant value proposition\n\nMerchants use our solutions to increase conversion rates and grow and manage their business. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to utilize our various products. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business.\n\nOur PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. These seamless experiences reduce cart abandonment and drive higher conversion rates for merchants. Our buy now, pay later solutions are embedded into our branded checkout experiences, which can help increase consumer spend and enable merchants to grow sales.\n\nOur unbranded payments processing solutions, which includes Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments, allow merchants to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online with a variety of popular ways to pay, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, PayPal Pay Later, and local payment methods.\n\nWe offer a suite of value added services, including payouts, payments orchestration, and fraud prevention and risk management solutions that help reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs. We also offer omnichannel solutions that allow merchants to make sales in person using our Zettle by PayPal app, card reader, or point of sale systems.\n\n6",

      "question": "How has American Express's dependency on aggregators evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to merchant acceptance challenges, surcharging risks, and third-party contractual inconsistencies that could impact card usage and transaction volumes?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's dependency on aggregators has remained a strategic necessity but has increasingly exposed the company to risks tied to inconsistent third-party alignment, surcharging practices, and merchant steering behaviors. In 2022, AXP acknowledged reliance on aggregators to manage merchant relationships and promote card acceptance, but warned that third-party business goals might conflict with AXP's interests. By 2023, this dependency had intensified, with AXP explicitly stating it was 'increasingly relying' on aggregators and processors, heightening exposure to inconsistent promotion of card usage and potential discrimination against American Express cards, especially with the introduction of debit cards on the network. In 2024, the risk evolved further as AXP highlighted legal and regulatory threats tied to merchant contract provisions, including non-discrimination clauses, and noted that adverse legal outcomes could force changes in merchant agreements, increasing the likelihood of surcharging and steering by merchants, which could impair the Card Member experience and reduce transaction volumes. This progression shows a growing vulnerability tied to third-party alignment and regulatory exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AXP](2023) \u2192 [Aggregators]: AXP increasingly relied on aggregators to manage merchant relationships and promote card acceptance but noted that these third parties may have conflicting business strategies, impacting card promotion and exposing AXP to surcharging and steering risks.",
        "Hop 2: [AXP](2024) \u2192 [Aggregators]: Legal proceedings and regulatory scrutiny around merchant contract provisions (e.g., non-discrimination clauses) heightened AXP\u2019s exposure to potential changes in business practices, surcharging, and merchant steering, which could impair card usage and brand perception.",
        "Hop 3: [AXP](2022) \u2192 [Aggregators]: AXP recognized early on that its reliance on aggregators and processors to manage merchant relationships could lead to inconsistent promotion of card usage and potential discrimination against American Express cards, foreshadowing the more acute risks seen in later years."

Many of these actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages and require us to incur significant costs for legal representation, arbitration fees or other legal or related services. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our ex posure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of legal challenges to, and new regulations affecting, our arbitration provisions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\n\nWe expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\n\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory scrutiny has continued to increase in a number of areas, and regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, as previously disclosed, we entered into agreements to resolve governmental investigations related to historical sales practices for certain U.S. small business customers, which are described in more detail in Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.' In addition, we are cooperating with ongoing regulatory inquiries concerning our rewards and benefits programs, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business.'\n\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\n\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings, arbitrations and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings.\n\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa's and Mastercard's policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. For example, in 2024 Visa and Mastercard proposed a lawsuit settlement agreement that would have, among other things, required reductions and caps on interchange fees and streamlined requirements for merchants who wish to impose a surcharge on credit transactions. While the settlement agreement was not approved by the court, Visa and Mastercard may ultimately agree or be subject to changes in policies or practices that result in greater surcharging generally or downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with reductions and caps on interchange fees.\n\n## We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\n\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers.\n\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cybersecurity and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions or other events could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch service providers or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties may face similar or greater risks as us, including as a result of their relationship with us; however, they may be less prepared to mitigate those risks and may be",

When we work with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but such third parties may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards, and readiness efforts for returning to our offices may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.",

      "question": "How has American Express's competitive positioning and regulatory dependency on card networks evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny, competitive pressures from other global networks, and the company's strategic responses to these dynamics?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's relationship with card networks has evolved from a position of strong competitive differentiation to one marked by increasing regulatory dependency and external pressure. In 2022, Amex emphasized its global position as the fourth-largest general-purpose card network behind China UnionPay, Visa, and Mastercard, competing aggressively on brand value, rewards programs, and premium customer experiences. By 2023, the company highlighted intensified competition not only from traditional card networks but also from alternative payment platforms like Alipay, PayPal, and Venmo, as well as regional payment systems such as the National Payments Corporation of India. This growing competitive landscape underscored the need for innovation and investment in digital and mobile services. In 2024, the tone shifted significantly as Amex became a Category III firm under the U.S. federal bank regulatory framework, subjecting it to heightened regulatory expectations and constraints. Regulatory scrutiny over interchange fees, network routing, and cobrand arrangements\u2014especially in the EU\u2014led to Amex exiting its network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia, and facing uncertainty over future regulatory interpretations. This evolution reflects a trajectory where Amex's independence and competitive edge have been increasingly shaped and constrained by regulatory forces, transforming its strategic posture from one of market-driven competition to one of regulatory navigation and compliance adaptation.",

New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase the costs and complexity of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Political developments can result in legislative and regulatory uncertainty and changes to supervisory and enforcement priorities. In addition, legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, resulting in us becoming subject to heightened regulatory expectations and more stringent regulatory requirements. As we continue to grow, these expectations and requirements may further increase, such as if we become a Category II firm, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. While in some cases our business is subject to exemptions related to certain of these regulations, there is no guarantee that such ex emptions will continue to be available and even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Payments Regulation' under 'Business' for more information. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, a number of federal and state laws to regulate various aspects of network operations are being considered or have passed, including regarding information associated with electronic transactions (such as the use of specific merchant categories codes or limitations on the use of transaction data) and pricing of electronic transactions (such as interchange fees on sales tax  or gratuities).\n\nLegislators and regulators also continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices. This focus has included fees associated with card and banking products, such as a rule issued by the CFPB related to credit card fees for late payments (which is currently stayed); interest rates, such as recent proposals to cap credit card interest rates; rewards programs, such as the recent inquiries by the CFPB and DOT focused on credit card and airline rewards programs; and factors considered by financial institutions in providing services, such as 'fair access' laws. Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could materially and adversely impact our revenue growth and profitability, including, as a result of increased scrutiny of our pricing, underwriting and account management practices; the imposition of fines and customer remediation; higher compliance costs; reputational harm; restrictions on our ability to issue cards, appropriately price for the value of our products or work with certain business partners; and changes to our business practices generally.\n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation with respect to compliance with AML/CFT laws, sanctions regimes and anti-corruption laws in numerous jurisdictions. As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, near real-time money movement solutions are adopted, we introduce new products like checking accounts and geopolitical tensions increase, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny, and we are working to make enhancements to our existing programs, policies and procedures and to identify and remediate deficiencies. For example, we recently voluntarily reported certain transactions and accounts to OFAC, some of which related to Iran, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation - Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance' under 'Business.' Errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, deficiencies in our related compliance programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities or sanctioned persons, entities, governments or countries can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers' association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\n\nSee 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business' for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.",

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express held $630 million in Foreign Government Bonds and Obligations with a weighted average yield of 1.74% for securities due within one year and 2.42% for those due after one but within five years. By 2023, the yield for bonds due within one year increased significantly to 6.45%, while those due after one but within five years had a yield of 4.48%. In 2024, the yield for bonds due within one year decreased slightly to 5.86%, and those due after one but within five years dropped sharply to 2.03%. This pattern indicates a shift in American Express's strategy from relatively stable, low-yield foreign government bonds in 2022 to more aggressive short-term investments in 2023, followed by a partial retreat in 2024 with reduced long-term exposure, suggesting a dynamic response to market conditions and interest rate changes.",

      "question": "How did American Express's reliance on third-party merchant acquirers evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of negotiated network rate fees and merchant coverage expansion strategies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's relationship with third-party merchant acquirers transitioned from a foundational revenue model based on negotiated network rate fees (2022) to a more strategic dependency on these partners for global merchant coverage expansion (2023), culminating in 2024 with an increased emphasis on leveraging these acquirers to scale marketing and penetrate low- and new-to-plastic industries. The negotiated network rate fees remained a consistent revenue source across all years, but the strategic framing evolved from operational facilitation (2022\u20132023) to growth enablement (2024).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [AXP](2023) \u2192 [Third-Party Merchant Acquirers]: In 2023, AXP received a negotiated network rate fee from third-party merchant acquirers, which was recorded as discount revenue at the time of transaction, indicating a transactional and operational partnership.",
        "Hop 2: [AXP](2024) \u2192 [Third-Party Merchant Acquirers]: In 2024, AXP's success in expanding merchant coverage globally became explicitly tied to the performance and collaboration with third-party acquirers, aggregators, and processors, showing a strategic pivot toward growth and market penetration.",
        "Hop 3: [AXP](2022) \u2192 [Third-Party Merchant Acquirers]: In 2022, AXP already had a structured model where third-party acquirers (e.g., under OptBlue or GNS partners) were integral to transaction facilitation, with negotiated fees forming part of the discount revenue, indicating early strategic integration of these partners into the revenue model."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

      "question": "How has American Express's strategic positioning relative to alternative payment mechanisms evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of competitive pressure and technological investment, and what does this reveal about the company's long-term resilience in a rapidly digitizing payments landscape?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express increasingly acknowledged the growing competitive threat posed by alternative payment mechanisms, expanding its description of competitors to include not only traditional card networks and financial institutions but also fintech platforms like Alipay, PayPal, and Venmo, as well as innovations such as buy now, pay later (BNPL), digital wallets, and blockchain-based systems. In 2022 and 2023, the company primarily framed alternative payment mechanisms as competitors, emphasizing the need to differentiate through rewards, digital services, and brand strength. By 2024, however, the narrative shifted to one of dependency and necessity\u2014Amex recognized that its future competitiveness would hinge on its ability to invest in and integrate emerging technologies like open banking, real-time settlement, and AI-driven systems. This evolution reflects a strategic pivot from viewing alternative mechanisms solely as threats to understanding that active participation and innovation in this space is critical for long-term relevance and resilience.",

        "Hop 1: [AXP](2023) \u2192 [Alternative Payment Mechanisms]: In 2023, AXP explicitly listed alternative payment mechanisms as competitors, including digital wallets, BNPL, and fintech platforms like PayPal and Venmo, highlighting the need to differentiate through features like rewards and digital services.",
        "Hop 2: [AXP](2024) \u2192 [Alternative Payment Mechanisms]: By 2024, AXP acknowledged a strategic dependency on successfully investing in and adopting new technologies such as open banking, real-time settlement, and AI, indicating a shift from competitive framing to a necessity for integration and innovation.",
        "Hop 3: [AXP](2022) \u2192 [Alternative Payment Mechanisms]: In 2022, AXP described alternative payment mechanisms as a growing competitive force, particularly in the context of digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic, such as contactless and e-commerce payments."

These risks to our brand and reputation, as well as other risks described in this Risk Factors section, are heightened by the increasing sophistication and availability of artificial intelligence technology, including by assisting with the creation of deepfakes and increasing the velocity of distribution of disinformation. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\n\nWe face increased scrutiny from stakeholders who have diverging views related to business practices and company activities, which could result in reputational harm, litigation, enforcement actions and other adverse consequences. In addition, we are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and legal risks related to environmental, social and governance topics, such as those arising from new disclosure requirements in certain jurisdictions. Inaccurate perceptions or mischaracterizations of disclosures on these topics, or our goals and initiatives, while outside of our control, could impact our reputation, colleague hiring and retention and public perceptions of our business.\n\n## If we are not able to successfully invest in, and compete with respect to, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and may have unintended consequences or ultimately be unsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our ex isting technology.\n\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours, including as a result of increased involvement by technology companies in the payments industry and our competitors' greater scale or ability to pursue and adopt new technologies. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and overestimate our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology. Our and our partners' use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including flaws in models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, unintended or unexpected outcomes, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, infringement of intellectual property rights, ex posure of proprietary or personal information, heightened security risks and the ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. The complex ity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members, merchants or service providers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\n## We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, from inadequate systems or controls of the acquired company, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks and we may not have the relevant expertise or business structure to achieve the desired results. It may take us longer than ex pected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.",

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions.

      "question": "How did Mastercard's risk management methodology evolve from 2022 through 2024 in response to legal and regulatory pressures, and what quantitative changes in settlement risk exposure mitigation strategies are evident across this period?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's risk management methodology evolved in response to mounting legal and regulatory pressures, which prompted more structured and transparent disclosures around settlement risk exposure and mitigation strategies. In 2022, the company highlighted its low historical losses from customer failures and described its use of risk mitigation arrangements like cash collateral and credit enhancements for non-compliant customers. By 2023, Mastercard faced a formal consent agreement with the FTC related to compliance with the Durbin Amendment, which required operational changes to debit transaction routing. This regulatory scrutiny likely prompted more rigorous internal reviews of risk standards, as noted in the 2023 disclosures. In 2024, the company was involved in high-profile legal challenges, including the EMV liability shift litigation where damages claimed against the Network Defendants exceeded $1 billion, and investigations by the European Commission into anti-competitive behavior. In response, Mastercard emphasized periodic reviews of its risk management methodology and revisions to settlement exposure estimates. The progression from routine risk management in 2022 to regulatory enforcement actions in 2023 and significant litigation exposure in 2024 reveals a trajectory of increasing complexity in risk governance and more proactive disclosure of mitigation strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's implementation of its multi-layered security approach evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of third-party collaboration, real-time payment infrastructure expansion, and resilience against cyber threats?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's implementation of its multi-layered security approach became more robust and externally collaborative. In 2022, the company emphasized a multi-layered approach involving Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers, and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, working internally and through public-private partnerships to monitor and respond to threats. It also highlighted its work with stakeholders to develop technical standards like EMV for secure transactions. By 2023, Mastercard expanded this approach by explicitly including third-party service providers in its threat monitoring and response framework and noted that it was operating or implementing real-time payment infrastructure in 13 markets as of year-end, enhancing the security footprint across more jurisdictions. In 2024, the company further deepened its external collaboration, noting that it worked with experts across the organization and through third-party providers to monitor and respond to cyber threats, while also expanding its real-time payments infrastructure globally.

We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same ('domestic transactions'). We switch over 60% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.\n\nWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\n\nCore Network Architecture. Our core network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple  value-added  services  (such  as  fraud  scoring,  tokenization  services,  etc.)  to  appropriate  transactions  in  real  time.  This architecture  enables  us  to  connect  all  parties  regardless  of  where  or  how  the  transaction  is  occurring.  It  has  24-hour  a  day availability and world-class response time.\n\n## Additional Payment Capabilities\n\nACH  Batch  and  Real-Time  Account-Based  Payments  Infrastructure  and  Applications. We  offer  ACH  batch  and  real-time account-based  payments  capabilities,  enabling  payments  for  ACH  transactions  between  bank  accounts  in  real-time.  These capabilities  provide  consumers  and  businesses  the  ability  to  make  instant  (faster)  payments  while  providing  enhanced  data  and messaging  capabilities.  We  build,  implement,  enhance  and  operate  real-time  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructure,  payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. As of December 31, 2021, we either operated or were implementing realtime payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also apply our real-time payments capabilities to new payment flows, such as consumer bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions.\n\nAccount to Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. We apply these capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and remittances.\n\nWe discuss below under 'Our Payment Products and Applications' the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based and account to account payment capabilities to capture new payment flows.\n\n## Security and Franchise\n\nPayments System Security. We have a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information  security  challenges,  including  maintaining  an  information  security  program,  an  enterprise  resilience  program  and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the organization (as  well  as  through  other  sources  such  as  public-private  partnerships)  to  monitor  and  respond  quickly  to  a  range  of  cyber  and physical threats.\n\nAs  another  feature  of  our  multi-layered  approach  to  protect  the  global  payments  ecosystem,  we  work  with  issuers,  acquirers, merchants,  governments  and  payments  industry  associations  to  develop  and  put  in  place  technical  standards  (such  as  EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in 'Our Value-Added Services'.\n\nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the following key activities:\n\n- Participant Onboarding. We ensure the capability of new customers to use our network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on the network\n- Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network\n- Operating Standards. We define the operational, technical and financial policies to which network participants are required to adhere",

In 2022, the company disclosed its regular monitoring of the credit risk portfolio and risk mitigation adequacy, and its practice of revising estimated settlement exposure as necessary. In 2023, amid a Federal Trade Commission investigation and a consent agreement related to the Durbin Amendment, the company reiterated its risk management policies and noted that it experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures. In 2024, despite facing multiple legal challenges\u2014including a denied summary judgment motion in a $1+ billion liability shift case and an investigation by the European Commission\u2014Mastercard continued to emphasize its global risk management procedures and the short-term nature of settlement exposure.

Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards, and readiness efforts for returning to our offices may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.",

Many of these actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages and require us to incur significant costs for legal representation, arbitration fees or other legal or related services. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our ex posure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of legal challenges to, and new regulations affecting, our arbitration provisions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\n\nWe expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\n\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory scrutiny has continued to increase in a number of areas, and regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, as previously disclosed, we entered into agreements to resolve governmental investigations related to historical sales practices for certain U.S. small business customers, which are described in more detail in Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.' In addition, we are cooperating with ongoing regulatory inquiries concerning our rewards and benefits programs, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business.'\n\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\n\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings, arbitrations and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings.\n\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa's and Mastercard's policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. For example, in 2024 Visa and Mastercard proposed a lawsuit settlement agreement that would have, among other things, required reductions and caps on interchange fees and streamlined requirements for merchants who wish to impose a surcharge on credit transactions. While the settlement agreement was not approved by the court, Visa and Mastercard may ultimately agree or be subject to changes in policies or practices that result in greater surcharging generally or downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with reductions and caps on interchange fees.\n\n## We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\n\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers.\n\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cybersecurity and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions or other events could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch service providers or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties may face similar or greater risks as us, including as a result of their relationship with us; however, they may be less prepared to mitigate those risks and may be",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's relationship with global card networks shifted from a primarily competitive posture to a more complex dynamic influenced by increasing regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, AXP clearly positioned itself as a competitor to other card networks like Visa, Mastercard, and China UnionPay, emphasizing differentiation through premium benefits and cobrand partnerships. By 2023, this competitive stance remained, but there was growing emphasis on the challenges posed by alternative payment platforms like Alipay and PayPal, as well as increasing competition for unique partner offerings such as lounge access and travel benefits. In 2024, regulatory pressures significantly impacted AXP\u2019s relationship with card networks, particularly in the EU and Australia, where AXP exited its network licensing businesses due to regulatory constraints. Additionally, AXP faced uncertainty regarding cobrand arrangements in the EU due to differing regulatory interpretations. This evolution shows a trajectory from direct competition to a more constrained environment shaped by regulatory dependencies, particularly in international markets.",

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

In addition, legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, resulting in us becoming subject to heightened regulatory expectations and more stringent regulatory requirements. As we continue to grow, these expectations and requirements may further increase, such as if we become a Category II firm, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. While in some cases our business is subject to exemptions related to certain of these regulations, there is no guarantee that such ex emptions will continue to be available and even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Payments Regulation' under 'Business' for more information. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, a number of federal and state laws to regulate various aspects of network operations are being considered or have passed, including regarding information associated with electronic transactions (such as the use of specific merchant categories codes or limitations on the use of transaction data) and pricing of electronic transactions (such as interchange fees on sales tax  or gratuities).\n\nLegislators and regulators also continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices. This focus has included fees associated with card and banking products, such as a rule issued by the CFPB related to credit card fees for late payments (which is currently stayed); interest rates, such as recent proposals to cap credit card interest rates; rewards programs, such as the recent inquiries by the CFPB and DOT focused on credit card and airline rewards programs; and factors considered by financial institutions in providing services, such as 'fair access' laws. Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could materially and adversely impact our revenue growth and profitability, including, as a result of increased scrutiny of our pricing, underwriting and account management practices; the imposition of fines and customer remediation; higher compliance costs; reputational harm; restrictions on our ability to issue cards, appropriately price for the value of our products or work with certain business partners; and changes to our business practices generally.\n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation with respect to compliance with AML/CFT laws, sanctions regimes and anti-corruption laws in numerous jurisdictions. As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, near real-time money movement solutions are adopted, we introduce new products like checking accounts and geopolitical tensions increase, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny, and we are working to make enhancements to our existing programs, policies and procedures and to identify and remediate deficiencies. For example, we recently voluntarily reported certain transactions and accounts to OFAC, some of which related to Iran, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation - Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance' under 'Business.' Errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, deficiencies in our related compliance programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities or sanctioned persons, entities, governments or countries can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers' association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\n\nSee 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business' for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.",

      "question": "How did American Express's yield profile from Foreign Government Bonds and Obligations evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does the progression in weighted average yields (6.45% in 2023, 5.85% in 2024, and the 2022 fair value distribution) indicate about the company's investment strategy and market conditions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express held $630 million in Foreign Government Bonds and Obligations with a majority (628 million) maturing within one year, indicating a short-duration focus. In 2023, the weighted average yield on these bonds was 6.45%, the highest among all categories. By 2024, the yield on Foreign Government Bonds and Obligations had decreased to 5.85%, still relatively high compared to other instruments. This decline suggests a potential shift in market conditions or a strategic adjustment in the composition of the portfolio, possibly reducing exposure to higher-yielding, shorter-duration instruments in favor of more stable or diversified maturities. The trend reflects either a response to falling interest rates or a deliberate risk management move.",

        "Hop 2: [AXP](2024) \u2192 [Foreign Government Bonds and Obligations]: Weighted average yield on these bonds dropped to 5.85%, down from 2023, suggesting a shift in portfolio composition or market yield conditions.",

      "question": "How did American Express's revenue structure and dependency on third-party merchant acquirers evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of discount revenue recognition, network rate fee negotiation, and the role of third-party acquirers in facilitating global merchant acceptance?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's relationship with third-party merchant acquirers evolved in alignment with its global merchant coverage expansion strategy. In 2022, AXP recognized discount revenue from third-party acquirers (e.g., under the OptBlue program) via individually negotiated network rate fees, which were recorded at the time of transaction. In 2023, AXP further clarified that third-party acquirers were integral to facilitating transactions on the American Express network, with revenue from these arrangements recorded as discount revenue, and expanded the role of these acquirers in processed revenue through network partnership agreements. By 2024, AXP emphasized strategic expansion of merchant acceptance through third-party acquirers, aggregators, and processors globally, noting that success depended on the value propositions offered to these acquirers and merchants, as well as the ability to scale marketing and acceptance programs. This indicates a shift from a primarily transactional revenue model to a more strategic, partnership-driven approach aimed at increasing global card usage and merchant coverage.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

In 2024, rather than framing alternative payment mechanisms solely as a competitive threat, American Express shifted toward a dependency posture, highlighting the necessity of investing in and integrating these technologies\u2014such as open banking, real-time settlement, and tokenization\u2014into its core offerings to remain competitive.

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions.

Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\n\nWe face increased scrutiny from stakeholders who have diverging views related to business practices and company activities, which could result in reputational harm, litigation, enforcement actions and other adverse consequences. In addition, we are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and legal risks related to environmental, social and governance topics, such as those arising from new disclosure requirements in certain jurisdictions. Inaccurate perceptions or mischaracterizations of disclosures on these topics, or our goals and initiatives, while outside of our control, could impact our reputation, colleague hiring and retention and public perceptions of our business.\n\n## If we are not able to successfully invest in, and compete with respect to, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and may have unintended consequences or ultimately be unsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our ex isting technology.\n\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours, including as a result of increased involvement by technology companies in the payments industry and our competitors' greater scale or ability to pursue and adopt new technologies. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and overestimate our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology. Our and our partners' use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including flaws in models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, unintended or unexpected outcomes, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, infringement of intellectual property rights, ex posure of proprietary or personal information, heightened security risks and the ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. The complex ity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members, merchants or service providers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\n## We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, from inadequate systems or controls of the acquired company, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks and we may not have the relevant expertise or business structure to achieve the desired results. It may take us longer than ex pected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to abusive behaviors evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its credit products and third-party risk management strategies, and what specific actions did the company take in 2023 and 2024 to mitigate these risks?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal highlighted the growing risk of abusive behaviors in its credit products, noting that third parties were increasingly exploiting digital payment systems through synthetic identities, stolen financial instruments, and fraudulent transactions. In 2023, PayPal responded by entering into a multi-year agreement to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, signaling a strategic move to offload risk exposure in certain credit segments. In 2024, the company continued to emphasize the threat of abusive behaviors but also noted ongoing efforts to improve detection mechanisms and reduce fraud at scale, particularly as it expanded its credit offerings in international markets. This progression shows a shift from identifying and describing the problem (2022) to actively mitigating exposure through asset sales (2023) and enhancing fraud prevention infrastructure (2024).",

        "Hop 1: [PYPL](2022) \u2192 [Abusive Behaviors]: In 2022, PayPal described increasing threats from synthetic identities, stolen financial instruments, and fraud attacks as key risks to its credit and payment services.",
        "Hop 2: [PYPL](2023) \u2192 [Abusive Behaviors]: In 2023, PayPal took action by selling up to \u20ac40 billion in BNPL loan receivables in Europe, reducing its exposure to high-risk credit portfolios vulnerable to abuse.",
        "Hop 3: [PYPL](2024) \u2192 [Abusive Behaviors]: In 2024, PayPal continued to highlight the evolving nature of fraud and abusive behaviors, emphasizing the need for improved detection systems and resilience in digital payment services."

The  non-payment  rate  among  account  holders  may  increase  due  to,  among  other  factors,  changes  to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as  a  recession  or  government  austerity  programs,  increases  in  prevailing  interest  rates,  and  high  unemployment  rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our PayPal branded merchant financing offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer  and  merchants  products  outside  the  U.S.  through  our  international  subsidiaries.  If  we  are  unable  to  fund  our  credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor information on lending regulations that impact our business, see ' Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business -Lending Regulation ' in this risk factor section.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to  originate  our  U.S.  credit  products  to  consumers,  U.S.  merchant  financing,  and  branded  credit  card  products;  PayPalbranded  debit  card  products  issued  by  an  unaffiliated  bank;  cryptocurrency  custodial  service  providers;  and  external  business partners  and  contractors  who  provide  key  functions  (e.g.,  outsourced  customer  support  and  product  development  functions; facilities;  information  technology,  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing). These  risks  include  legal,  regulatory,  information security,  reputational,  operational,  or  any  other  risks  inherent  in  engaging  and  relying  upon  a  third-party.  If  we  are  unable  to effectively  manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial  disruptions  in  these  relationships,  our  operations,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  results  could  be  adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree  of  control  over  business  operations,  governance,  and  compliance,  thereby  potentially  increasing  our  financial,  legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that  take  place  within  a  single  country  or  market.  In  certain  markets,  cross-border  trade  represents  our  primary  (and  in  some instances our only) presence.\n\nCross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nThird parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information,  making  transactions  with  stolen  financial  instruments,  abusing  or  misusing  our  services  for  financial  gain,  or fraudulently  inducing  users  of  our  systems  into  engaging  in  bad  transactions.  Due  to  the  nature  of  PayPal's  digital  payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions.

The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries.

We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted.

      "question": "How has PayPal's exposure to margin risk evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its transaction pricing models, use of payment processors, and incentives provided to customers across those years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal explicitly stated that it bears full margin risk when completing payment transactions, with fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions recognized as transaction expense. In 2023, the company reiterated this exposure to margin risk and added details about incentives provided to merchants and consumers, which are recognized as a reduction of revenue depending on performance targets or amortized over the contractual term. In 2024, PayPal again confirmed its full margin risk exposure and highlighted the independence of the fee charged to customers from the costs incurred when utilizing payment processors. Across the three years, the consistent acknowledgment of bearing full margin risk demonstrates a stable strategic approach, while the increasing detail around incentives and transaction pricing reflects a more nuanced disclosure of how margin risk is managed and potentially mitigated through dynamic pricing and cost structures.",

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n## Recent accounting guidance\n\nIn  2020,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ('FASB')  issued  ASU  2020-04, Reference  Rate  Reform (Topic  848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers  on  our  payments  platform  and  from  other  value  added  services.  Our  revenues  are  classified  into  two  categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a  fixed  and  variable  component. The  variable  component  is  generally  a  percentage  of  the  value  of  the  payment  amount  and  is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement  when  the  underlying  transaction  is  approved  for  a  refund.  We  estimate  the  amount  of  fee  refunds  that  will  be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform,  which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV').  We  earn  additional  fees  on transactions  where  we  perform  currency  conversion,  when  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already  provided.  Our  contracts  generally  renew  automatically  without  any  significant  material  rights.  Some  of  our  contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs and we do not carry any material contract balances.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using  our  risk  assessment  tools,  we  perform  a  transaction  risk  assessment  on  individual  transactions  to  determine  whether  a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of  completing  a  payment  transaction. As  a  principal  to  the  transaction,  we  control  the  service  of  completing  payments  on  our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

      "question": "How did PYPL's exposure to its fixed-rate 2.850% notes evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about its long-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "PYPL's exposure to the fixed-rate 2.850% notes remained stable at $1.5 billion in both 2022 and 2023, but by 2024, the company still carried the full $1.5 billion balance, indicating no repayments or refinancing actions over the three-year period. This suggests that PYPL has maintained a consistent long-term liability position for this specific note, possibly prioritizing other debt maturities or leveraging the low fixed rate as part of a broader capital structure strategy.",

        "Hop 1: [PYPL](2022) \u2192 [Fixed-rate 2.850% notes]: $1,500 million outstanding as of 2021 and 2020, with maturity in 2029 and an effective interest rate of 2.96%.",
        "Hop 2: [PYPL](2023) \u2192 [Fixed-rate 2.850% notes]: Still carried $1,500 million balance with no indication of repayment or restructuring, maturity unchanged at 2029 and effective interest rate at 2.96%.",
        "Hop 3: [PYPL](2024) \u2192 [Fixed-rate 2.850% notes]: Continued to carry the full $1,500 million balance as of 2024, showing no reduction despite other active debt issuances and repayments in the portfolio."

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to bad transactions through its credit and BNPL products evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in light of the 2023 sale of up to \u20ac40 billion in U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables and the ongoing risks related to fraud and third-party processing disruptions?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's exposure to bad transactions evolved significantly as it transitioned from managing a growing credit and BNPL portfolio to partially offloading that risk through a major asset sale in 2023, while continuing to face persistent threats from fraud and third-party dependencies. In 2022, PayPal highlighted increasing risks around bad transactions due to fraud, synthetic identities, and stolen financial instruments, particularly in its digital payment services. The company also noted its reliance on third-party lenders and processors, which introduced additional operational and reputational risks. In 2023, PayPal entered into a multi-year agreement in June to sell up to \u20ac40 billion in U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, effectively reducing its direct exposure to bad transactions in that segment, although the sale was subject to conditions and execution risks. Despite this, PayPal still faced challenges in managing fraud and account takeover attempts. By 2024, the company continued to emphasize the risks of bad transactions, particularly from fraud schemes and third-party processing, but had shifted some of the credit risk burden through the BNPL receivables sale. However, uncertainty remained around regulatory challenges and the effectiveness of fraud detection systems, indicating that while the direct exposure to bad transactions had decreased, the underlying risks persisted.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PYPL](2022) \u2192 [Bad Transactions]: In 2022, PayPal identified increasing risks of bad transactions due to fraud, synthetic identities, and stolen financial instruments, particularly in its digital payment services.",

        "Hop 3: [PYPL](2024) \u2192 [Bad Transactions]: In 2024, PayPal continued to highlight bad transaction risks from fraud and third-party processing, though the BNPL portfolio sale had partially mitigated credit risk exposure."

The  non-payment  rate  among  account  holders  may  increase  due  to,  among  other  factors,  changes  to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as  a  recession  or  government  austerity  programs,  increases  in  prevailing  interest  rates,  and  high  unemployment  rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our PayPal branded merchant financing offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer  and  merchants  products  outside  the  U.S.  through  our  international  subsidiaries.  If  we  are  unable  to  fund  our  credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor information on lending regulations that impact our business, see ' Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business -Lending Regulation ' in this risk factor section.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to  originate  our  U.S.  credit  products  to  consumers,  U.S.  merchant  financing,  and  branded  credit  card  products;  PayPalbranded  debit  card  products  issued  by  an  unaffiliated  bank;  cryptocurrency  custodial  service  providers;  and  external  business partners  and  contractors  who  provide  key  functions  (e.g.,  outsourced  customer  support  and  product  development  functions; facilities;  information  technology,  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing). These  risks  include  legal,  regulatory,  information security,  reputational,  operational,  or  any  other  risks  inherent  in  engaging  and  relying  upon  a  third-party.  If  we  are  unable  to effectively  manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial  disruptions  in  these  relationships,  our  operations,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  results  could  be  adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree  of  control  over  business  operations,  governance,  and  compliance,  thereby  potentially  increasing  our  financial,  legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that  take  place  within  a  single  country  or  market.  In  certain  markets,  cross-border  trade  represents  our  primary  (and  in  some instances our only) presence.\n\nCross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nThird parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information,  making  transactions  with  stolen  financial  instruments,  abusing  or  misusing  our  services  for  financial  gain,  or fraudulently  inducing  users  of  our  systems  into  engaging  in  bad  transactions.  Due  to  the  nature  of  PayPal's  digital  payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions.

The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted.

      "question": "How did PayPal's strategy and execution around seamless checkout experiences evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of merchant adoption, consumer engagement, and integration of buy now, pay later solutions, and what measurable business outcomes were associated with these developments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal emphasized creating seamless checkout experiences as part of its core growth strategy, aiming to increase customer use of its products and expand merchant adoption globally. By 2023, the company had begun enhancing its technology infrastructure to support seamless checkout, including intuitive user interfaces, payment network integrations, and developer tools, while also expanding buyer protection programs to simplify shopping experiences. In 2024, PayPal had fully integrated its seamless checkout experiences across both PayPal and Venmo branded solutions, embedding buy now, pay later options directly into the checkout flow, which helped reduce cart abandonment and drive higher merchant conversion rates. The 2024 report also indicated that these checkout enhancements were linked to increased consumer engagement and merchant adoption, particularly through the expansion of PayPal\u2019s credit offerings in multiple international markets.",

Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:\n\n- Growing our core business : through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers' use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing, and moving money, creating seamless checkout experiences, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;\n- Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers :  by being technology and platform agnostic, partnering with our  merchants  to  grow  and  expand  their  business  online  and  in-store,  and  providing  consumers  with  simple,  secure,  and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms and simplifying their shopping experiences;\n- Forming strategic partnerships : by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments ecosystem; and\n- Seeking  new  areas  of  growth :  organically  and  through  acquisitions  and  strategic  investments  in  our  existing  and  new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation in both the digital and physical world.\n\n## ESG MANAGEMENT\n\nPayPal  is  committed  to  creating  a  more  inclusive  global  economy  and  advancing  our  core  values  of  Collaboration,  Inclusion, Innovation,  and  Wellness  across  our  communities,  workforce,  and  strategies.  We  manage  priority  ESG  risks  and  opportunities through  four  key  pillars:  (1)  social  innovation,  (2)  employees  and  culture,  (3)  environmental  sustainability,  and  (4)  responsible business  practices.  We  believe  this  integrated,  enterprise-wide  approach  to  managing  our  global  business  responsibly  helps  to enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders, including our employees, stockholders, partners, and communities. In 2021, we continued to advance our ESG strategy, including through the following: a science-based approach to reducing our climate change impacts,  targeted  investments  to  address  the  racial  wealth  gap  and  empower  underserved  communities  and  businesses, programmatic development intended to foster an inclusive culture across the employee lifecycle, and ongoing enhancements to support  the  safety  and  security  of  our  products  and  platform.  We  take  this  commitment  seriously  and  endeavor  to  provide transparent disclosures on the progress of this work through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications.\n\n## TECHNOLOGY\n\nOur  payments  platform  utilizes  a  combination  of  proprietary  and  third-party  technologies  and  services  intended  to  facilitate transactions efficiently and securely between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks.

Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers online or offline, including mobile. We drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and offline. Our PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards. Our PayPal- and V enmo-branded debit and credit cards give consumers the ability to transact in-person through our platform and earn incentives, including cash-back rewards.\n\nWe also offer consumers person-to-person ('P2P') payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, V enmo, and Xoom products and services. Our V enmo digital wallet in the United States ('U.S.') is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment.\n\nWe offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom ('U.K.'), France, and G ermany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interestbearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in G ermany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and V enmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network.\n\nWe generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. We also earn revenue from interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\n\n## Merchant value proposition\n\nMerchants use our solutions to increase conversion rates and grow and manage their business. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to utilize our various products. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business.\n\nOur PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. These seamless experiences reduce cart abandonment and drive higher conversion rates for merchants. Our buy now, pay later solutions are embedded into our branded checkout experiences, which can help increase consumer spend and enable merchants to grow sales.\n\nOur unbranded payments processing solutions, which includes Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments, allow merchants to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online with a variety of popular ways to pay, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, PayPal Pay Later, and local payment methods.\n\nWe offer a suite of value added services, including payouts, payments orchestration, and fraud prevention and risk management solutions that help reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs. We also offer omnichannel solutions that allow merchants to make sales in person using our Zettle by PayPal app, card reader, or point of sale systems.\n\n6",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's methodology for estimating settlement exposure evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this consistency indicate about the company's risk management approach despite increasing regulatory scrutiny and litigation risks?",
      "answer": "Mastercard's methodology for estimating settlement exposure remained consistent across 2022, 2023, and 2024, using the average daily payment volume during the three months prior to period-end multiplied by the estimated number of days of exposure. Despite facing ongoing regulatory investigations (including from the FTC and DOJ in 2023 and the European Commission in 2024) and multiple litigation risks (such as the U.S. Liability Shift Litigation and TCPA class action), the company maintained its core risk management framework. The disclosed approach to risk mitigation\u2014requiring certain customers to provide cash collateral or credit enhancements based on individual risk assessments\u2014was also unchanged across all three years. This consistent methodology suggests that Mastercard viewed its existing risk management practices as robust and sufficient to address evolving external pressures without requiring fundamental changes to its settlement exposure estimation process.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MA](2023) \u2192 [Risk Management Methodology]: In 2023, Mastercard disclosed that it estimated settlement exposure using average daily payment volume over the prior three months multiplied by estimated days of exposure, and that it periodically reviews its risk management methodology.",
        "Hop 2: [MA](2024) \u2192 [Risk Management Methodology]: In 2024, Mastercard reiterated the same settlement exposure estimation methodology and emphasized that it periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards, indicating no substantive change despite new legal pressures including the European Commission investigation.",
        "Hop 3: [MA](2022) \u2192 [Risk Management Methodology]: In 2022, Mastercard stated it estimated settlement exposure using the same methodology\u2014average daily payment volume over the prior three months multiplied by estimated days of exposure\u2014and noted that it reviews its risk management methodology from time to time."

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's multi-layered security approach has evolved significantly in scope and execution. In 2022, the company emphasized a multi-layered framework that included collaboration with issuers, acquirers, and governments to develop technical standards like EMV, and it operated or was implementing real-time payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 GDP markets. By 2023, the company had expanded this to 13 markets globally and integrated more real-time value-added services like fraud scoring and tokenization into transaction routing. In 2024, Mastercard further solidified its security posture by enhancing partnerships and public-private collaborations, while also expanding domestic transaction processing in China through a joint venture, reflecting a broader global reach and deeper integration of security into new markets and services.",

As of December 31, 2021, we either operated or were implementing realtime payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also apply our real-time payments capabilities to new payment flows, such as consumer bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions.\n\nAccount to Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. We apply these capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and remittances.\n\nWe discuss below under 'Our Payment Products and Applications' the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based and account to account payment capabilities to capture new payment flows.\n\n## Security and Franchise\n\nPayments System Security. We have a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information  security  challenges,  including  maintaining  an  information  security  program,  an  enterprise  resilience  program  and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the organization (as  well  as  through  other  sources  such  as  public-private  partnerships)  to  monitor  and  respond  quickly  to  a  range  of  cyber  and physical threats.\n\nAs  another  feature  of  our  multi-layered  approach  to  protect  the  global  payments  ecosystem,  we  work  with  issuers,  acquirers, merchants,  governments  and  payments  industry  associations  to  develop  and  put  in  place  technical  standards  (such  as  EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in 'Our Value-Added Services'.\n\nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the following key activities:\n\n- Participant Onboarding. We ensure the capability of new customers to use our network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on the network\n- Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network\n- Operating Standards. We define the operational, technical and financial policies to which network participants are required to adhere",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard consistently estimated settlement exposure using the average daily payment volume during the three months prior to period-end multiplied by the estimated number of days of exposure. This methodology remained unchanged across all three years. However, in 2023, regulatory scrutiny intensified with the FTC finalizing a consent agreement related to debit routing provisions and the DOJ issuing a Civil Investigative Demand focusing on antitrust concerns in the U.S. debit program. In response, Mastercard emphasized its ongoing monitoring of the credit risk portfolio and adequacy of risk mitigation arrangements, which include cash collateral and credit enhancements such as letters of credit and guarantees. In 2024, amid a denied summary judgment motion in the U.S. Liability Shift Litigation and a new European Commission investigation into card scheme fees, Mastercard continued to refine its risk management methodology and maintained its approach to risk mitigation. Despite increasing external legal and regulatory pressures, there is no explicit evidence of a change in the settlement exposure estimation methodology or the structure of credit risk mitigation arrangements across the three-year period.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nprohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. When we work with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but such third parties may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards, and readiness efforts for returning to our offices may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.",

Many of these actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages and require us to incur significant costs for legal representation, arbitration fees or other legal or related services. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our ex posure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of legal challenges to, and new regulations affecting, our arbitration provisions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\n\nWe expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\n\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory scrutiny has continued to increase in a number of areas, and regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, as previously disclosed, we entered into agreements to resolve governmental investigations related to historical sales practices for certain U.S. small business customers, which are described in more detail in Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.' In addition, we are cooperating with ongoing regulatory inquiries concerning our rewards and benefits programs, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business.'\n\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\n\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings, arbitrations and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings.\n\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa's and Mastercard's policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. For example, in 2024 Visa and Mastercard proposed a lawsuit settlement agreement that would have, among other things, required reductions and caps on interchange fees and streamlined requirements for merchants who wish to impose a surcharge on credit transactions. While the settlement agreement was not approved by the court, Visa and Mastercard may ultimately agree or be subject to changes in policies or practices that result in greater surcharging generally or downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with reductions and caps on interchange fees.\n\n## We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\n\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers.\n\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cybersecurity and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions or other events could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch service providers or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties may face similar or greater risks as us, including as a result of their relationship with us; however, they may be less prepared to mitigate those risks and may be",

      "question": "How did American Express's financial and strategic reliance on third-party merchant acquirers evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of revenue recognition models and merchant acquisition strategies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's relationship with third-party merchant acquirers evolved from a primarily transactional revenue model to a more integrated strategic partnership, with increasing emphasis on global merchant coverage expansion and network modernization. In 2022, AXP recognized discount revenue from third-party acquirers via individually negotiated network rate fees under programs like OptBlue. In 2023, the company expanded this model by introducing 'Processed revenue' tied to network partnership agreements, including royalties and fees for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. By 2024, AXP explicitly highlighted strategic dependence on third-party acquirers for global merchant acceptance growth, emphasizing co-marketing efforts, digital integration, and modernization of the authorization platform. This progression shows a shift from a transaction-based fee structure to a broader strategic alliance framework aimed at enhancing global acceptance and digital capabilities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

      "question": "How has American Express's positioning relative to alternative payment mechanisms evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of competitive pressure and strategic adaptation to technological innovations such as open banking, digital wallets, and real-time settlement systems?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express faced increasing competitive pressure from alternative payment mechanisms, including digital wallets (e.g., PayPal, Venmo), payment aggregators, and real-time settlement systems. In 2022, the company acknowledged the 'dynamic and rapid growth' of these mechanisms as a key competitive threat. In 2023, the scope of alternative mechanisms expanded to include open banking platforms and more integrated financial services offerings from competitors. By 2024, American Express shifted from a purely competitive stance to a strategic dependence on adopting these technologies, emphasizing investments in open banking, digital identification, and real-time settlement systems to remain relevant. This evolution reflects a transformation from viewing alternative payment mechanisms as external threats to recognizing them as essential components of its technological roadmap.",

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nreferring to the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. These risks to our brand and reputation, as well as other risks described in this Risk Factors section, are heightened by the increasing sophistication and availability of artificial intelligence technology, including by assisting with the creation of deepfakes and increasing the velocity of distribution of disinformation. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\n\nWe face increased scrutiny from stakeholders who have diverging views related to business practices and company activities, which could result in reputational harm, litigation, enforcement actions and other adverse consequences. In addition, we are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and legal risks related to environmental, social and governance topics, such as those arising from new disclosure requirements in certain jurisdictions. Inaccurate perceptions or mischaracterizations of disclosures on these topics, or our goals and initiatives, while outside of our control, could impact our reputation, colleague hiring and retention and public perceptions of our business.\n\n## If we are not able to successfully invest in, and compete with respect to, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and may have unintended consequences or ultimately be unsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our ex isting technology.\n\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours, including as a result of increased involvement by technology companies in the payments industry and our competitors' greater scale or ability to pursue and adopt new technologies. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and overestimate our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology. Our and our partners' use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including flaws in models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, unintended or unexpected outcomes, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, infringement of intellectual property rights, ex posure of proprietary or personal information, heightened security risks and the ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. The complex ity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members, merchants or service providers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\n## We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, from inadequate systems or controls of the acquired company, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks and we may not have the relevant expertise or business structure to achieve the desired results. It may take us longer than ex pected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's approach to managing settlement risk exposure evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny and litigation risks, and what does this reveal about the company's risk management methodology adjustments over time?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's approach to managing settlement risk exposure remained grounded in its core risk management methodology, which included requiring risk mitigation arrangements such as cash collateral and credit enhancements for non-compliant customers. In 2022, the company emphasized its historical low level of losses from customer failures and its periodic review of risk standards. By 2023, amid the FTC\u2019s finalized consent agreement over debit routing and the DOJ\u2019s antitrust investigation into U.S. debit programs, Mastercard reiterated its commitment to risk mitigation but also acknowledged the increasing complexity of regulatory oversight. In 2024, the company faced additional legal pressures, including the denial of summary judgment in the U.S. Liability Shift Litigation and a new European Commission investigation into network fees. Despite these challenges, Mastercard maintained that its risk management methodology was periodically reviewed and updated, with settlement exposure estimates revised accordingly. The consistent use of gross settlement exposure estimation\u2014based on average daily payment volume multiplied by exposure days\u2014remained a key metric across all three years, indicating a stable analytical framework despite rising external risk factors.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's multi-layered security approach evolve alongside its real-time payments infrastructure expansion from 2022 to 2024, and what does this parallel development suggest about the company's strategy for managing payment processing risk as it scaled globally?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard described a multi-layered security approach that included a robust program to protect its network from cyber threats, with multiple layers of protection across its platforms, and noted it was operating or implementing real-time payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 GDP markets as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, the company had expanded its real-time payments infrastructure to 13 markets and reiterated its multi-layered security framework, emphasizing third-party assessments and partnerships to address threats, including those from third-party providers. In 2024, while continuing to describe the same multi-layered security approach, Mastercard noted it was operating real-time payments infrastructure in 'several countries around the world,' signaling a qualitative shift toward broader global deployment. This parallel evolution suggests that Mastercard has intentionally scaled its security capabilities in tandem with its real-time payments infrastructure, aiming to maintain trust and integrity in the ecosystem as it expands into new markets, though the filings do not explicitly state that security measures directly enabled infrastructure expansion.",

          "chunk_text": "to accept, our products and services across country borders. We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same ('domestic transactions'). We switch over 60% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.\n\nWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\n\nCore Network Architecture. Our core network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple  value-added  services  (such  as  fraud  scoring,  tokenization  services,  etc.)  to  appropriate  transactions  in  real  time.  This architecture  enables  us  to  connect  all  parties  regardless  of  where  or  how  the  transaction  is  occurring.  It  has  24-hour  a  day availability and world-class response time.\n\n## Additional Payment Capabilities\n\nACH  Batch  and  Real-Time  Account-Based  Payments  Infrastructure  and  Applications. We  offer  ACH  batch  and  real-time account-based  payments  capabilities,  enabling  payments  for  ACH  transactions  between  bank  accounts  in  real-time.  These capabilities  provide  consumers  and  businesses  the  ability  to  make  instant  (faster)  payments  while  providing  enhanced  data  and messaging  capabilities.  We  build,  implement,  enhance  and  operate  real-time  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructure,  payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. As of December 31, 2021, we either operated or were implementing realtime payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also apply our real-time payments capabilities to new payment flows, such as consumer bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions.\n\nAccount to Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. We apply these capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and remittances.\n\nWe discuss below under 'Our Payment Products and Applications' the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based and account to account payment capabilities to capture new payment flows.\n\n## Security and Franchise\n\nPayments System Security. We have a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information  security  challenges,  including  maintaining  an  information  security  program,  an  enterprise  resilience  program  and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the organization (as  well  as  through  other  sources  such  as  public-private  partnerships)  to  monitor  and  respond  quickly  to  a  range  of  cyber  and physical threats.\n\nAs  another  feature  of  our  multi-layered  approach  to  protect  the  global  payments  ecosystem,  we  work  with  issuers,  acquirers, merchants,  governments  and  payments  industry  associations  to  develop  and  put  in  place  technical  standards  (such  as  EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in 'Our Value-Added Services'.\n\nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the following key activities:\n\n- Participant Onboarding. We ensure the capability of new customers to use our network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on the network\n- Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network\n- Operating Standards. We define the operational, technical and financial policies to which network participants are required to adhere",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard maintained a consistent framework for managing its credit risk portfolio, including requiring customers not meeting risk standards to enter into risk mitigation arrangements such as cash collateral, letters of credit, and guarantees. However, the context in which these strategies were applied changed significantly. In 2022, the company emphasized its regular monitoring of the credit risk portfolio and the adequacy of risk mitigation arrangements. By 2023, amid the FTC's finalized consent agreement over debit routing compliance and the initiation of a DOJ antitrust investigation into its U.S. debit program, Mastercard reiterated its commitment to revising settlement exposure estimates and risk standards as necessary. In 2024, with the DOJ investigation ongoing and new legal challenges such as the U.S. Liability Shift Litigation and a European Commission investigation into anti-competitive behavior, the company continued to refine its risk management methodology. Despite these pressures, Mastercard consistently reported a low level of losses from customer settlement failures across all three years, indicating that its core credit risk strategies remained effective even as external risks escalated.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

      "answer": "Capital One's total short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased from $43.086 billion in 2022 to $48.715 billion in 2023, then declined to $45.551 billion in 2024. This trajectory shows a significant rise in debt levels during 2023, followed by a partial reduction in 2024. The composition of debt also shifted notably: floating unsecured senior debt dropped from $1.709 billion in 2022 to $349 million in 2023, and was entirely eliminated by 2024. Meanwhile, the weighted-average interest rate on fixed unsecured senior debt rose from 2.91% in 2022 to 4.45% in 2023 and further to 4.84% in 2024, indicating a strategic shift toward fixed-rate debt amid rising interest rates.",

      "question": "How did Capital One's fair value and valuation assumptions for net derivative assets (liabilities) evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly regarding the use of discounted cash flow models and key unobservable inputs like default rates and swap rates?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One reported a net derivative assets (liabilities) fair value of $19 million, with a net unrealized loss of $20 million still held as of year-end, though the specific valuation technique was not disclosed. By 2023, the fair value of net derivative assets (liabilities) was $58 million, and the company explicitly stated the use of discounted cash flow models, citing default rates ranging from 53-163% and swap rates of 3-5%. In 2024, the fair value remained at $58 million, with the valuation continuing to rely on discounted cash flows, maintaining the same swap rate range of 3-5%. This progression shows a shift toward more transparent and methodologically consistent valuation practices starting in 2023, with increased specificity in unobservable inputs, particularly around default rate assumptions.",

        "Hop 1: [COF](2022) \u2192 [Net derivative assets (liabilities)]: Fair value of $19 million with $20 million net unrealized loss still held; no valuation technique specified.",

      "question": "How did Capital One's (COF) total senior and subordinated notes evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year progression reveal about its capital structure strategy and interest rate positioning?",
      "answer": "Capital One's total senior and subordinated notes increased from $27.219 billion in 2022 to $31.248 billion in 2023, then slightly declined to $30.696 billion in 2024. This indicates a significant capital raise in 2023, with a partial reversal in 2024. The weighted average interest rate on unsecured senior debt rose from 2.76% in 2022 to 4.48% in 2023, and further to 4.84% in 2024, reflecting a strategic shift toward fixed-rate financing amid rising interest rates. This evolution shows Capital One's increasing reliance on more expensive senior debt and reduced use of floating-rate instruments, signaling a long-term capital structure transformation to lock in financing costs.",

      "answer": "Capital One's fixed unsecured senior debt grew from a carrying value of $19,975 million in 2022 to $27,168 million in 2023, then slightly declined to $26,930 million in 2024. The weighted-average interest rate rose steadily from 2.91% in 2022 to 4.45% in 2023 and further to 4.84% in 2024. This trajectory suggests a strategic shift toward securing more long-term fixed-rate financing during a rising interest rate environment, locking in capital at increasingly higher costs over time.",

      "question": "How did COF's total short-term borrowings and long-term debt evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year progression reveal about the company's capital structure and debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "COF's total short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased from $43.086 billion in 2022 to $49.856 billion in 2023, then decreased to $45.551 billion in 2024. This pattern indicates a strategic shift in debt management, with a significant increase in 2023 followed by a deliberate reduction in 2024. The weighted-average interest rate on long-term debt also rose from 2.76% in 2022 to 4.48% in 2023, and further to 4.84% in 2024, suggesting rising borrowing costs over time. The reduction in floating unsecured senior debt from $1,709 million in 2022 to $349 million in 2023 and its complete elimination by 2024 reflects a move away from variable-rate instruments. This 3-year trend reveals a dynamic capital structure with a peak in 2023 followed by a strategic deleveraging in 2024, while facing increasing interest rate environments.",

      "answer": "Capital One's net derivative assets (liabilities) had a fair value of $31 million in 2022, with a net unrealized loss of $20 million still held. By 2023, the fair value of net derivative assets (liabilities) was $58 million, using 'default' as the significant unobservable input with a weighted average of 4%. In 2024, the fair value remained at $58 million, but the significant unobservable input shifted to 'swap rates' with a weighted average of 4%. This evolution indicates a shift in the key risk driver from default assumptions in 2023 to interest rate sensitivity in 2024, while maintaining a consistent valuation level. The reduction in realized losses from $43 million in 2022 to stable values in 2023 and 2024 suggests improved risk management or market stabilization.",

      "question": "How did AIG's international terrorism exposure and reinsurance protections evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of modeled loss estimates, attachment points, and reinsurance recoverable assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AIG estimated a $1.3 billion net loss from a five-ton bomb attack in New York City after TRIPRA and reinsurance recoveries, with a $1.7 billion deductible under TRIPRA. By 2023, AIG continued to actively monitor and model terrorism risk using third-party vendor models, with international terrorism exposure estimated via scenario-based modeling and targeted reinsurance purchases. In 2024, AIG's reinsurance recoverable assets reached $38.0 billion, including $29.1 billion in ceded loss reserves, reflecting an expansion in reinsurance protections. Over the three-year period, AIG maintained a consistent approach to terrorism risk modeling while increasing its reliance on reinsurance to manage global exposures, particularly outside the U.S., where it retained core attachment points of $200 million in Japan and $125 million elsewhere.",

          "chunk_text": "enhancements. For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New Y ork City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

Further to the occurrence protection, there is $175 million of limit in excess of a $350 million retention (subject to per event caps) placed on a worldwide aggregate excess of loss cover and $400 million of limit excess $550 million on an aggregate index basis via the renewed Tailwind Re Cat Bond which covers U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada named storm losses.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios.

Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $1.3 billion based on the exposures as of October 1, 2021.\n\nOur exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2021, TRIPRA covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $1.7 billion for 2021.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Life and Retirement Companies' Key Risks\n\nWe manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.\n\nFor Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLongevity risk -represents the risk of an increase in liabilities associated with an insurance product, e.g. an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nMorbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions resulting in higher claim amounts. This risk exists in a number of our product lines such as individual and group accident and health and long-term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to Fortitude Re.\n\nMortality (including pandemic) risk -represents the risk of unexpected loss arising from current actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected current mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 167",

      "question": "How did AIG's geographic concentration of natural catastrophe risk exposure evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of U.S. hurricane and earthquake exposure versus international perils like European windstorms and global wildfire risks?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AIG identified significant U.S. hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S., and mid-Atlantic regions, along with earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest. It also noted wildfire exposure in California. By 2023, AIG expanded its exposure recognition to include European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries, while still emphasizing U.S. hurricane and earthquake risks. In 2024, AIG maintained a similar geographic footprint as in 2023, continuing to highlight U.S. hurricane and earthquake risks alongside European windstorms and global wildfire exposures, indicating a consistent global diversification of modeled perils. This progression shows AIG's growing recognition of international catastrophe risks while maintaining a strong focus on U.S. exposures.",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively.

The discount rates were 2.75 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2.28 percent at December 31, 2020. The methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. pension plans.\n\nIn general, the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans were developed using a similar methodology to the U.S. AIG Retirement plan, by using country-specific Mercer Yield Curves.\n\nThe projected benefit obligation for AIG's Japan pension plans represents approximately 50 percent and 51 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 0.52 percent and 0.56 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was selected by reference to the Mercer Yield Curve for Japan.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term, limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including, but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, liquidity, and concentration, and incorporates the risk/return profile applicable to each asset class.\n\nThere were no shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## U.S. Pension Plan\n\nThe assets of the qualified plan are monitored by the AIG U.S. Investment Committee and actively managed by the investment managers, which involves allocating the plan's assets among approved asset classes within ranges as permitted by the strategic allocation.

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG's reinsurance recoverable assets were not explicitly quantified in the provided excerpt, but the company emphasized the use of proportional and non-proportional reinsurance to mitigate insurance loss exposure, including participation in traditional and capital market reinsurance vehicles. By 2023, AIG reported total reinsurance recoverable assets of $67.5 billion, including $30.4 billion in ceded loss reserves and $28.2 billion in life reinsurance recoverables, indicating a robust reinsurance strategy. In 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets dropped significantly to $38.0 billion, with life reinsurance recoverable falling to just $0.8 billion, while ceded loss reserves remained relatively stable at $29.1 billion.

          "chunk_text": "enhancements. For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New Y ork City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

          "chunk_text": "In designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. We use these assumptions to project future policy level account value changes. We map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. Net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n\nOur hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. These hedging programs are designed to offset the economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. Similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic liability hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index universal life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n\nTo manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits. As such, periodic adjustments are made to the hedging portfolio in order to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n\nOur hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are subject to two-way collateralization, managed under a net zero collateral threshold.\n\nThe hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events.

In 2022, AIG emphasized the uncertainty in loss development and outlined internal oversight and external expert reviews as key tools. By 2023, AIG expanded its risk management framework to include sensitivity and scenario analyses, stochastic methods, and experience studies, indicating a more quantitative and layered approach to measuring insurance risk exposure. In 2024, AIG further integrated these practices into a broader enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, including second-line review and challenge of reserving models and assumptions, and enhanced reporting to committees and regulators. The progression shows a shift from reactive oversight to proactive, model-driven, and enterprise-wide risk governance.",

          "chunk_text": "AIG generates multiple connections and dependencies among its affiliates and legal entities. Financial interconnections are utilized by A IG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several A IG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\n\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with A IG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. A IG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal A udit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A  primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability  and reserv e rev iews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n\nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nThe potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit.\n\nOur business is exposed to various catastrophic events, including natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, or pandemic disease, in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year, adversely affecting our business and operating results. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nOur business is exposed to loss events, such as fires or explosions, that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance.\n\nSince we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability  or unwillingness to pay , contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated, which is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\nWe closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n85",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG's international terrorism exposure management evolved through consistent scenario-based modeling, expanded reliance on government-sponsored reinsurance pools, and strategic adjustments in risk retention and mitigation. In 2022, AIG estimated a $1.3 billion loss from a five-ton bomb attack in New York City, net of TRIPRA and reinsurance. By 2024, AIG maintained its core attachment points for Japan at $200 million and rest of world at $125 million, indicating a deliberate retention strategy. Throughout the period, AIG relied on both private reinsurance and government-backed terrorism pools in non-U.S. jurisdictions, while also enhancing its catastrophe protection structure, including global property per risk covers. The reinsurance recoverable assets reached $38.0 billion by 2024, reflecting a growing reliance on reinsurance to manage terrorism risk exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "For Validus Re, our catastrophe protection comes from a variety of reinsurance protections but is largely providing $400 million of per occurrence limit in excess of a $150 million retention for US windstorm and earthquake, $150 million of per occurrence limit in excess of a $200 million retention for Europe, Japan and other US perils and in excess of $125 million retention for rest of the world perils. Further to the occurrence protection, there is $175 million of limit in excess of a $350 million retention (subject to per event caps) placed on a worldwide aggregate excess of loss cover and $400 million of limit excess $550 million on an aggregate index basis via the renewed Tailwind Re Cat Bond which covers U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada named storm losses.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nFor additional information see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $1.3 billion based on the exposures as of October 1, 2021.\n\nOur exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2021, TRIPRA covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $1.7 billion for 2021.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Life and Retirement Companies' Key Risks\n\nWe manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.\n\nFor Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLongevity risk -represents the risk of an increase in liabilities associated with an insurance product, e.g. an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nMorbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions resulting in higher claim amounts. This risk exists in a number of our product lines such as individual and group accident and health and long-term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to Fortitude Re.\n\nMortality (including pandemic) risk -represents the risk of unexpected loss arising from current actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected current mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 167",

          "chunk_text": "enhancements. For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New Y ork City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

      "question": "How did AIG's Probable Maximum Loss (PML) estimates for natural catastrophe risk evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's changing risk exposure and underwriting strategy in high-risk geographies like Florida, California, and Japan?",
      "answer": "AIG's PML modeling approach remained consistent across the three years, using third-party catastrophe models and adjustments for climate change considerations, but the underlying exposure dynamics show an evolving risk profile. In 2022, AIG highlighted significant gross wildfire exposures in California and earthquake exposure in the Pacific Northwest, with modeled PML estimates reflecting the in-force portfolio as of October 1, 2021. By 2023, AIG updated its modeling inputs to reflect the in-force portfolio as of October 1, 2023, continuing to emphasize climate change's impact on risk profiles and strategic planning. In 2024, AIG adjusted its modeling timeline to reflect exposures as of July 1, 2024, suggesting a more responsive approach to evolving catastrophe risks. The shift from October to July as the reference date for exposure data indicates a more dynamic and frequent recalibration of risk models, likely in response to increasing climate volatility and client demand in high-risk areas. This evolution suggests that AIG is adapting its underwriting strategy and risk capital allocation to maintain competitiveness while managing growing natural catastrophe exposures.",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

      "answer": "AIG's glide path approach for its U.S. pension plan remained consistent in strategy but evolved in target allocations for the Return-Seeking portion of the portfolio: in 2022, the target allocation was based on the funded status at December 31, 2021; in 2023, the target allocation was set for 2024 based on the funded status at December 31, 2023; and in 2024, the target allocation was set for 2025 based on the funded status at December 31, 2024.

          "chunk_text": "## Discount Rate Methodology\n\nThe projected benefit cash flows under the U.S. AIG Retirement Plan were discounted using the spot rates derived from the Mercer U.S. Pension Discount Yield Curve (Mercer Yield Curve) at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which resulted in a single discount rate that would produce the same liability at the respective measurement dates. The discount rates were 2.75 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2.28 percent at December 31, 2020. The methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. pension plans.\n\nIn general, the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans were developed using a similar methodology to the U.S. AIG Retirement plan, by using country-specific Mercer Yield Curves.\n\nThe projected benefit obligation for AIG's Japan pension plans represents approximately 50 percent and 51 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 0.52 percent and 0.56 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was selected by reference to the Mercer Yield Curve for Japan.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term, limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including, but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, liquidity, and concentration, and incorporates the risk/return profile applicable to each asset class.\n\nThere were no shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## U.S. Pension Plan\n\nThe assets of the qualified plan are monitored by the AIG U.S. Investment Committee and actively managed by the investment managers, which involves allocating the plan's assets among approved asset classes within ranges as permitted by the strategic allocation. The long-term strategic asset allocation historically has been reviewed and revised approximately every three years. The investment strategy is focused on de-risking the qualified plan via regular monitoring through liability driven investing and the glide path approach, where the glide path defines the target allocation for the 'Return-Seeking' portion of the portfolio (i.e., growth assets) based on the funded ratio and level of interest rates. Under this approach, the allocation to growth assets is reduced and the allocation to liability-hedging assets is increased as the plan's funded ratio increases in accordance with the defined glide path.\n\nThe following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for the U.S. qualified plan and the target allocation for 2022 based on the plan's funded status at December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "question": "What does the trajectory of AIG's reinsurance recoverable assets from $67.5 billion in 2023 to $38.0 billion in 2024 indicate about the company's evolving approach to managing insurance loss exposure, particularly in light of the firm's hedging and reinsurance strategies described in earlier filings?",
      "answer": "The significant decline in AIG's reinsurance recoverable assets from $67.5 billion in 2023 to $38.0 billion in 2024, following no specific total disclosed in 2022, suggests a strategic shift in how AIG is managing insurance loss exposure. In 2022, AIG emphasized a robust hedging framework using derivatives and fixed income instruments to manage market risk embedded in variable annuities and index-linked products, while also leveraging reinsurance to mitigate capital risk from catastrophic events. By 2023, reinsurance remained a core risk mitigation tool, with $67.5 billion in recoverable assets, including $28.2 billion in life reinsurance, indicating a continued reliance on external risk transfer. However, in 2024, the total reinsurance recoverable dropped sharply to $38.0 billion, with life reinsurance recoverable falling to just $0.8 billion, despite maintaining similar catastrophe risk exposures and continuing to use reinsurance to manage volatility and concentrations. This sharp decline implies a material shift in risk retention strategy\u2014potentially driven by changes in capital management priorities, improved internal risk modeling, or a recalibration of risk appetite. The firm still maintained $20.1 billion in collateral support, suggesting a more selective or conservative approach to reinsurance partnerships, possibly in response to market volatility and reinsurer capacity concerns noted in prior years.",

          "chunk_text": "In designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. We use these assumptions to project future policy level account value changes. We map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. Net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n\nOur hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. These hedging programs are designed to offset the economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. Similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic liability hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index universal life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n\nTo manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits. As such, periodic adjustments are made to the hedging portfolio in order to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n\nOur hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are subject to two-way collateralization, managed under a net zero collateral threshold.\n\nThe hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\n## Reinsurance markets include:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nTraditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nCapital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nOther insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n\n## The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nproportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nnon-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nfacultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n\nWe continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.",

TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

      "question": "How did AIG's management of loss reserves risk evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of oversight mechanisms, external expert involvement, and integration of risk modeling techniques?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG's management of loss reserves risk demonstrated a consistent yet maturing approach. In 2022, AIG emphasized internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, complemented by reviews from external experts. By 2023, the company expanded its risk management framework to include more structured processes such as pricing and risk selection models, underwriting approval authorities, and experience monitoring to refine assumptions. In 2024, AIG further integrated these practices into a broader enterprise risk management (ERM) system, with enhanced reporting to committees, audits by the Internal Audit Group, and a stronger emphasis on modeling techniques like stochastic and deterministic approaches. This evolution reflects a growing sophistication in managing loss reserves risk through layered oversight, continuous improvement, and model validation.",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "AIG generates multiple connections and dependencies among its affiliates and legal entities. Financial interconnections are utilized by A IG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several A IG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\n\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with A IG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. A IG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal A udit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A  primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability  and reserv e rev iews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n\nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nThe potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit.

      "answer": "Capital One's fixed unsecured senior debt increased from a carrying value of $19,975 million in 2022 to $27,168 million in 2023, and remained at $26,930 million in 2024. The weighted-average interest rate rose from 2.91% in 2022 to 4.45% in 2023, then slightly declined to 4.84% in 2024. This indicates a strategy shift toward issuing more long-term debt at higher interest rates, likely to capitalize on investor demand or to fund growth initiatives amid rising market rates.",

      "question": "How did Capital One's (COF) total short-term borrowings and long-term debt evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the 3-year trend reveal about its debt structure and interest rate exposure, particularly in relation to changes in floating and fixed unsecured senior debt and securitized debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Capital One's total short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased from $43.086 billion in 2022 to $48.715 billion in 2023, and further to $45.551 billion in 2024. This reflects a complex evolution in its debt structure. In 2022, securitized debt obligations were $14.994 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.51%, while floating unsecured senior debt was $1.709 billion at a 1.01% rate. By 2023, securitized debt rose to $18.043 billion at a higher average rate of 3.01%, and floating unsecured senior debt increased to $349 million at 6.75%, signaling a shift toward higher-cost short-term funding. In 2024, securitized debt declined slightly to $14.264 billion but with a significantly higher average rate of 3.48%, and floating unsecured senior debt was fully retired (dropped to $0). This trajectory shows Capital One's increasing reliance on fixed-rate senior debt, which rose from $19.975 billion in 2022 to $26.930 billion in 2024, with a corresponding rise in weighted-average interest rate from 2.91% to 4.84%, suggesting a strategic shift to lock in longer-term financing amid rising interest rates.",

        "Hop 2: COF(2023) \u2192 Total Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt: Total debt rose to $48.715 billion, with securitized debt at $18.043 billion (3.01% average rate) and floating unsecured senior debt spiking to $349 million at 6.75%.",

      "answer": "Capital One's net derivative assets/liabilities had a fair value of $19 million in 2022, increased to $58 million in 2023, and remained at $58 million in 2024. In 2022, the valuation included net losses of $20 million still held in the portfolio, and incorporated unobservable inputs like swap rates and default rates. By 2023, the valuation methodology continued to rely on discounted cash flows and unobservable inputs such as default rates (53\u2013163%) and swap rates (3\u20135%), with the latter being weighted at 4%. In 2024, the fair value remained at $58 million, with similar unobservable inputs (swap rates of 3\u20135%, weighted at 4%) still playing a key role in the valuation model. This indicates a significant increase in fair value from 2022 to 2023, followed by stabilization in 2024, reflecting a consistent modeling approach with swap rates as a core valuation input.",

Reinsurance (continued)\n\n## Catastrophe Coverage\n\nThe  Company  has  exposure  to  catastrophes  which  could  contribute  to  significant  fluctuations  in  the  Company's  results  of operations. For the U.S. and EMEA, the Company purchases catastrophe coverage to reinsure risks issued within territories that the Company believes are subject to the greatest catastrophic risks. For its other segments, the Company uses excess of retention and quota  share  reinsurance  agreements  to  provide  greater  diversification  of  risk  and  minimize  exposure  to  larger  risks.  Excess  of retention  reinsurance  agreements  provide  for  a  portion  of  a  risk  to  remain  with  the  direct  writing  company  and  quota  share reinsurance agreements provide for the direct writing company to transfer a fixed percentage of all risks of a class of policies.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverables\n\nThe Company reinsures its business through a diversified group of well-capitalized reinsurers. The Company analyzes recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with its reinsurers. The Company monitors ratings and evaluates the financial strength of its reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. The Company generally secures large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. These reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance, which at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were not significant. A U.S. life insurance subsidiary  of  the  Company  also  secured  collateral  from  its  counterparties  to  mitigate  counterparty  default  risk  related  to  its longevity reinsurance agreements.\n\nThe Company has secured certain reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. The Company had $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion of unsecured reinsurance recoverable balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $6.3 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total, $4.1 billion, or 65%, were with the Company's five largest ceded reinsurers, including $1.9 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $6.6 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total, $4.2 billion, or 64%, were with the Company's five largest ceded reinsurers, including $2.0 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured.\n\nThe  Company  has  reinsured  with  an  unaffiliated  third-party  reinsurer,  59.25%  of  the  closed  block  through  a  modified coinsurance agreement. The Company accounts for this agreement under the deposit method of accounting. The Company, having the right of offset, has offset the modified coinsurance deposit with the deposit recoverable.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

      "question": "How has MetLife's disclosure around FHLB advance agreements evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about its shifting reliance on secured borrowing for liquidity management?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed specific historical borrowing and repayment activity under FHLB advance agreements, including $0 borrowed in 2021 and $2.8 billion borrowed in 2020, with repayments of $700 million and $2.9 billion, respectively. By 2023 and 2024, no such quantitative disclosures were included, and the company instead provided more generalized statements about the diversity of funding sources enhancing flexibility and lowering costs. This shift from concrete FHLB data to broader qualitative assurances suggests MetLife may have reduced its reliance on secured FHLB borrowing, opting instead for alternative funding mechanisms like commercial paper or long-term debt.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing\n\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc.'s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Sources\n\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in '- Summary of the Company's Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,' the Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\n\n## Global Funding Sources\n\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit and committed facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, the collateral  financing arrangement, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. MetLife, Inc. maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and  hybrid  securities.  As  a  'Well-Known  Seasoned  Issuer'  under  SEC  rules,  MetLife,  Inc.'s  shelf  registration  statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility,  limits  dependence  on  any  one  market  or  source  of  funds  and  generally  lowers  the  cost  of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on preferred stock issuances.\n\n## Common Stock\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt\n\nMetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding each have a commercial paper program that is supported by our unsecured revolving credit facility (see '- Credit and Committed Facilities'). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.\n\n## FHLB Advance Agreements, Reported in Liabilities Held-for-Sale\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  we  borrowed  $0  and  $2.8  billion,  respectively,  and  repaid  $700 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, under advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, total obligations outstanding under these advance agreements were $0 and $700 million, respectively.\n\n## Policyholder Account Balances\n\nSee  Notes  1  and  4  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a  description  of  the  components  of policyholder  account  balances.  See  '-  Insurance  Liabilities'  regarding  the  source  and  uncertainties  associated  with  the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\n\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $248.6 billion ($29.5 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amount of $203.5 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\n\nThe estimated cash flows represent cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges;  annuitization;  mortality;  future  interest  credited;  policy  loans  and  other  contingent  events  as  appropriate  for  the respective  product  type.  Such  estimated  cash  payments  are  also  presented  net  of  estimated  future  premiums  on  policies currently  in-force  and  gross  of  any  reinsurance  recoverable.  For  obligations  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.",

      "answer": "MetLife's equity method net investment income from operating joint ventures declined sharply from $1,305 million in 2022 to $151 million in 2023, followed by a partial recovery to $988 million in 2024. This trajectory indicates a significant reduction in the scale or profitability of the company's insurance underwriting partnerships during 2023, which partially rebounded in 2024. The steep drop in 2023 suggests a major adjustment in the company's involvement in these ventures\u2014potentially involving exits, restructuring, or reduced capital allocation\u2014while the rebound in 2024 may reflect stabilization or the formation of new partnerships. The volatility in income aligns with strategic shifts in MetLife\u2019s approach to operating joint ventures over the three-year period.",

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nOther invested assets consist principally of the following:\n\n- Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in '- Derivatives' below.\n- Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax  credits  or  other  tax  incentives.  Where  tax  credits  are  guaranteed  by  a  creditworthy  third  party,  the  investment  is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 19.\n- Annuities funding structured settlement claims represent annuities funding claims assumed by the Company in its capacity as  a  structured  settlements  assignment  company.  The  annuities  are  stated  at  their  contract  value,  which  represents  the present  value  of  the  future  periodic  claim  payments  to  be  provided. The  net  investment  income  recognized  reflects  the amortization of discount of the annuity at its implied effective interest rate.\n- Direct financing leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value,  less  the  unearned  income,  less ACL.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the  pre-tax  internal  rate  of  return  to  the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation.\n- Leveraged leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less  the  unearned  income,  less  ACL  and  is  reported  net  of  non-recourse  debt.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the leveraged lease's estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease in those periods in which the net investment at the beginning of the period is positive. Leveraged leases derive investment returns in part from their income tax benefit. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments.\n- Investments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method.\n- Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ('FHLB') common stock are carried at redemption value and are considered restricted  investments  until  redeemed  by  the  respective  regional  FHLBs.  Dividends  are  recognized  in  net  investment income when declared.\n- Funds  withheld  represent  a  receivable  for  amounts  contractually  withheld  by  ceding  companies  in  accordance  with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions and Repurchase Agreements\n\nThe Company accounts for securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as financing arrangements and the associated  liability  is  recorded  at  the  amount  of  cash  received.  The  securities  loaned  or  sold  under  these  agreements  are included in invested assets. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements are recognized as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  securities  lending  transactions,  whereby  securities  are  loaned  to  unaffiliated  financial institutions. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MetLife's use of the deposit method of accounting for reinsurance showed a significant increase in both deposit assets and liabilities, reflecting a growing reinsurance exposure and a strategic shift toward risk transfer. In 2022, deposit assets and liabilities on reinsurance were $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. By 2023, the company had entered into a major reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic, which resulted in deposit assets of $10.3 billion. In 2024, deposit assets on reinsurance were $4.6 billion and deposit liabilities were $1.2 billion. This trajectory indicates a deliberate expansion of reinsurance activity, particularly in 2023, followed by a partial reduction in deposit assets by 2024, potentially signaling portfolio rebalancing or settlement activity post-transaction.",

Reinsurance (continued)\n\nReinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance were $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The deposit liabilities on reinsurance were $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 7. Closed Block\n\nOn April 7, 2000 (the 'Demutualization Date'), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ('MLIC') converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC's plan of reorganization, as amended (the 'Plan of Reorganization'). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and projected experience against the experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in experience.\n\nThe closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and other experience related to the closed block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed block policyholders in the future  may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend  scales  in  effect  for  1999  had  been  continued.  Any  cash  flows  in  excess  of  amounts  assumed  will  be  available  for distribution over time to closed block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over 100 years from the Demutualization Date.\n\nThe Company uses the same accounting principles to account for the participating policies included in the closed block as it used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represents the estimated maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result from operations, attributed net of income tax, to the closed block. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes  that  over  time  the  actual  cumulative  earnings  of  the  closed  block  will  approximately  equal  the  expected  cumulative earnings  due  to  the  effect  of  dividend  changes.  If,  over  the  period  the  closed  block  remains  in  existence,  the  actual  cumulative earnings of the closed block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess to  closed  block  policyholders  as  additional  policyholder  dividends  unless  offset  by  future  unfavorable  experience  of  the  closed block and, accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings.\n\nExperience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed  block,  is  based  upon  cumulative  actual  and  expected  earnings  within  the  closed  block. Accordingly,  the  Company's  net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block.\n\nClosed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.",

Also, included in other liabilities in the table above are deposit liabilities on reinsurance of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nIn November 2023, the Company completed a risk transfer transaction with subsidiaries of G lobal Atlantic Financial G roup ('G lobal Atlantic'), a retirement and life insurance company, to reinsure an in-force block of universal life, variable universal life, universal life with secondary guarantees, and fix ed annuities, which are reported in the MetLife Holdings segment.

The net cost of reinsurance will be amortized on a basis consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used for amortizing DAC related to the underlying reinsured contracts in policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nAs part of this transaction, the Company's institutional investment management business entered into investment advisory and other agreements with subsidiaries of Global Atlantic to serve as the investment manager for certain of the transferred general account assets.

      "answer": "MetLife's use of internally developed designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS remained a consistent practice across 2022 to 2024, reflecting ongoing acquisition activity in newly issued or less frequently evaluated securities. In 2022, MetLife noted that internally developed designations were applied when acquiring non-agency RMBS and CMBS that had not yet been evaluated by the NAIC. This practice continued in 2023 and 2024, indicating that MetLife continued to acquire such securities, and NAIC designations were not immediately available for all new holdings.

Prior to December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology incorporated the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) without regard to the issuance date. As of December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized  cost;  while  for  non-agency  RMBS  and  CMBS  issued  after  January  1,  2013,  the  modeling  methodology  does  not incorporate the amortized cost of the security. The NAIC's objective with the modeling methodology is to increase accuracy in estimating expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.\n\nEffective  December  31,  2020,  the  NAIC  implemented  20  'NAIC  designation  categories'  which  is  an  additional,  more granular  credit  quality  categorization.  These  NAIC  designation  categories  correspond  more  closely  to  the  NRSRO's  alphanumeric credit quality ratings. Effective December 31, 2021, the NAIC implemented new unique RBC factors for each of the 20 NAIC designation categories. The NAIC's goal is to better align RBC charges on securities with the instruments' actual credit risk.\n\nRating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's Investors Service ('Moody's'), S&amp;P, Fitch Ratings ('Fitch'), DBRS Morningstar, A.M. Best Company ('A.M. Best'), Kroll Bond Rating Agency and Egan Jones Ratings Company. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\n\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, held by MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries  that  maintain  the  NAIC  statutory  basis  of  accounting,  which  are  presented  using  NAIC designations for modeled securities. NRSRO ratings and NAIC designations are as of the dates shown below. Over time, credit ratings can migrate, up or down, through the NRSRO's and NAIC's continuous monitoring process.\n\n",

During the year ended December 31, 2024, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by $1.6 billion, or 4.9%. The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales, partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 in ex cess of transfers into Level 3 and a decrease in estimated fair value recognized in OCI.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality - Ratings\n\nThe Securities V aluation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity securities of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. The NAIC assigns securities  to  one  of  six   credit  quality  categories  defined  as  'NAIC  designations.'  In  general,  securities  with  NAIC  designations  of  1  and  2  are  considered investment grade and securities with NAIC designations of 3 through 6 are considered below investment grade.

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG estimated a $1.3 billion loss for a five-ton bomb attack in New York City, net of TRIPRA and reinsurance, and emphasized scenario-based modeling for international terrorism exposure. By 2023, AIG maintained its active monitoring and modeling approach, highlighting participation in country terrorism pools and targeted reinsurance purchases for international exposures. In 2024, AIG retained core attachment points for Japan at $200 million and rest of world at $125 million, while continuing to rely on both private reinsurance and government-sponsored programs for international terrorism risk.

Further to the occurrence protection, there is $175 million of limit in excess of a $350 million retention (subject to per event caps) placed on a worldwide aggregate excess of loss cover and $400 million of limit excess $550 million on an aggregate index basis via the renewed Tailwind Re Cat Bond which covers U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada named storm losses.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nFor additional information see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $1.3 billion based on the exposures as of October 1, 2021.\n\nOur exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2021, TRIPRA covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $1.7 billion for 2021.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Life and Retirement Companies' Key Risks\n\nWe manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.\n\nFor Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLongevity risk -represents the risk of an increase in liabilities associated with an insurance product, e.g. an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nMorbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions resulting in higher claim amounts. This risk exists in a number of our product lines such as individual and group accident and health and long-term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to Fortitude Re.\n\nMortality (including pandemic) risk -represents the risk of unexpected loss arising from current actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected current mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 167",

Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

The methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. pension plans.\n\nIn general, the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans were developed using a similar methodology to the U.S. AIG Retirement plan, by using country-specific Mercer Yield Curves.\n\nThe projected benefit obligation for AIG's Japan pension plans represents approximately 50 percent and 51 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 0.52 percent and 0.56 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was selected by reference to the Mercer Yield Curve for Japan.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term, limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including, but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, liquidity, and concentration, and incorporates the risk/return profile applicable to each asset class.\n\nThere were no shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## U.S. Pension Plan\n\nThe assets of the qualified plan are monitored by the AIG U.S. Investment Committee and actively managed by the investment managers, which involves allocating the plan's assets among approved asset classes within ranges as permitted by the strategic allocation. The long-term strategic asset allocation historically has been reviewed and revised approximately every three years. The investment strategy is focused on de-risking the qualified plan via regular monitoring through liability driven investing and the glide path approach, where the glide path defines the target allocation for the 'Return-Seeking' portion of the portfolio (i.e., growth assets) based on the funded ratio and level of interest rates. Under this approach, the allocation to growth assets is reduced and the allocation to liability-hedging assets is increased as the plan's funded ratio increases in accordance with the defined glide path.\n\nThe following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for the U.S. qualified plan and the target allocation for 2022 based on the plan's funded status at December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "question": "What does AIG's changing reinsurance recoverable asset position from 2022 to 2024 suggest about its approach to capital risk management and exposure to catastrophic events?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG's reinsurance recoverable assets increased significantly \u2014 from $38.0 billion in 2022 to $67.5 billion in 2023, and then declined to $38.0 billion in 2024 \u2014 indicating a dynamic approach to managing capital risk and insurance loss exposure. In 2022, AIG emphasized mitigating insurance loss exposure through hedging programs and reinsurance, particularly for catastrophic and market risks. By 2023, the reinsurance recoverable asset nearly doubled, reaching $67.5 billion, with $28.2 billion attributed to life reinsurance, suggesting an aggressive reinsurance strategy to offload risk and stabilize capital. However, by 2024, the reinsurance recoverable asset had dropped back to $38.0 billion, despite maintaining similar catastrophe reinsurance attachment points and continuing to monitor terrorism and natural disaster exposures. This decline may signal a strategic recalibration \u2014 possibly reducing reliance on reinsurance recoverables for capital management or a shift in risk retention strategy. The volatility in this key metric over the three-year period suggests that AIG was actively adjusting its capital risk posture in response to evolving market conditions, catastrophe losses, and interest rate environments, while continuing to rely on reinsurance as a core risk mitigation tool.",

          "chunk_text": "In designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. We use these assumptions to project future policy level account value changes. We map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. Net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n\nOur hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. These hedging programs are designed to offset the economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. Similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic liability hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index universal life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n\nTo manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits. As such, periodic adjustments are made to the hedging portfolio in order to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n\nOur hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are subject to two-way collateralization, managed under a net zero collateral threshold.\n\nThe hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\n## Reinsurance markets include:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nTraditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nCapital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nOther insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n\n## The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nproportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nnon-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nfacultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n\nWe continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.",

For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New Y ork City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

      "question": "How did AIG's management of loss reserves risk evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of oversight mechanisms, modeling approaches, and integration of external expert reviews?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG's management of loss reserves risk evolved to include increasingly structured oversight mechanisms, enhanced modeling approaches, and a consistent reliance on external expert reviews. In 2022, AIG emphasized internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, complemented by external expert reviews. By 2023, AIG introduced more sophisticated modeling techniques, including stochastic and deterministic methods, and reinforced its three-tiered hierarchy of risk limits to better manage uncertainties in loss estimation. In 2024, AIG further integrated enterprise risk management (ERM) oversight, including Second Line Review and Challenge processes, and expanded its use of scenario analyses and experience monitoring to ensure the robustness of loss reserve estimates. This progression reflects a maturing and more proactive approach to managing loss reserves risk.",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "AIG generates multiple connections and dependencies among its affiliates and legal entities. Financial interconnections are utilized by A IG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several A IG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\n\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with A IG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. A IG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal A udit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A  primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability  and reserv e rev iews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n\nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts.

We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n85",

      "question": "How did BNY Mellon's exposure to U.S. banking laws regarding capital planning and shareholder capital returns evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of regulatory constraints on dividends and share repurchases?",
      "answer": "BNY Mellon's disclosures consistently emphasized regulatory constraints on capital returns throughout 2022\u20132024, but the framing evolved from a general caution in 2022 to more specific references to U.S. banking laws and capital adequacy rules in 2023 and 2024. In 2022, the firm noted that capital returns were limited by U.S. banking laws and Delaware law. In 2023, it reiterated these constraints and highlighted the impact of preferred stock dividend obligations. By 2024, the language became more structured, emphasizing regulatory standards like 'well capitalized' status and capital adequacy rules as direct limitations on its ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends. This shows a trend of increasing specificity and formalization in how the firm communicates regulatory constraints on capital policy.",

        "Hop 2: [BK](2023) \u2192 [U.S. Banking Laws]: In 2023, the firm reiterated these limitations, adding that failure to pay full and timely preferred stock dividends could further constrain capital returns, signaling a more nuanced regulatory risk profile.",
        "Hop 3: [BK](2024) \u2192 [U.S. Banking Laws]: In 2024, the firm explicitly tied capital return limitations to regulatory standards such as 'well capitalized' and 'well managed' status, indicating a more formalized and rules-based constraint under U.S. banking laws."

      "answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon hosted the Directors' Code of Conduct on a URL path under the 'investor-relations' subdomain, indicating a focus on external stakeholder accessibility. In 2023, the URL remained consistent with the 2022 structure, suggesting continuity in how the company positioned governance documents for investor visibility. By 2024, the company consolidated its web presence under the main 'bny.com' domain, shifting the document path to a more centralized corporate website structure, which may signal a strategic move to unify governance disclosures under a single brand identity. Across the three years, the company consistently disclosed its intent to publicly announce any amendments or waivers to the Directors' Code of Conduct, maintaining transparency in governance practices despite evolving website architecture.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company disclosed the use of the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan alongside agreements for Performance Share Units and Restricted Stock Units dated 2019 and 2020. By 2023, the focus remained on the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan, but the disclosed agreements expanded to include 2020 Performance Share Units and Restricted Stock Units. In 2024, the company continued to reference the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan, but introduced agreements for Performance Share Units dated 2021 and 2022, indicating a progression in the types of incentive units tied to the plan over time.",

      "question": "How did BNY Mellon's disclosures regarding capital return limitations under U.S. banking laws evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression suggest about the company's strategic flexibility in shareholder capital distributions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon disclosed that its ability to return capital to shareholders was limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations, including those governing capital and capital planning, applicable provisions of Delaware law, and its failure to pay full and timely dividends on preferred stock. This language was repeated in 2023 and 2024, showing a consistent regulatory constraint over the three-year period. However, the 2024 disclosure added a new emphasis on the Parent's dependency on dividends from subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC to fund share repurchases and dividends, indicating a growing focus on internal capital flows under continued regulatory scrutiny. This three-year progression suggests that despite stable regulatory language, BNY Mellon faced ongoing limitations in capital return flexibility, with increasing internal structural dependencies shaping its shareholder return strategy.",

        "Hop 1: [BK](2022) \u2192 [U.S. Banking Laws]: Disclosed limitations on capital returns due to U.S. banking laws, Delaware law, and preferred stock dividend failures.",

      "question": "How did BK's disclosure regarding the ratification of KPMG LLP as principal accountant evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does the consistent mention of KPMG's PCAOB firm number 185 across all three filings suggest about BK's audit governance continuity?",
      "answer": "BK consistently disclosed the ratification of KPMG LLP as its principal accountant in each of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, with no substantive changes in the structure or framing of the disclosure across the years. In all three years, KPMG LLP's PCAOB firm identification number was explicitly stated as 185, indicating no change in the external audit firm responsible for financial reporting. This consistency suggests that BK maintained stable audit governance practices over the three-year period, with no indication of auditor rotation or changes in external audit oversight. The unchanged PCAOB number further confirms the ongoing relationship with KPMG, signaling continuity and potentially strong institutional trust in the firm\u2019s audit services.",

      "question": "How did Charles Schwab's use and pledging of client securities evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to margin lending and collateral obligations, and what does this trend indicate about the company's exposure to client-held assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab disclosed the fair value of client securities that could be used as collateral for margin loans, indicating active pledging practices. By 2023, the company maintained margin loan collateral under ASC 326, applying a practical expedient that reduced expected credit losses when collateral value exceeded loan amounts, and allowed pledging of collateralized securities in accordance with federal regulations. In 2024, Schwab continued pledging client securities, particularly for clients writing listed options cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation, and also provided cash collateral to clients in securities lending activities. This 3-year trend shows an increasing sophistication and exposure in how Schwab utilizes client securities for operational and regulatory purposes, reflecting both strategic risk management and growing client engagement in leveraged activities.",

We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

      "question": "How has Schwab's development and enhancement of its RIA-focused portfolio management tools, particularly Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect, evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression suggest about the company's strategy to support independent advisors?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Schwab consistently offered Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect as a free portfolio management solution for RIAs, emphasizing ease of use and eliminating the need to download and reconcile data. In 2022 and 2023, the focus was on delivering core capabilities through an intuitive experience, while in 2024, the description evolved to highlight a 'simplified portfolio management solution' with 'core capabilities and features through an intuitive modern experience.' This suggests a strategic emphasis on continuously refining the user experience and reinforcing Schwab's commitment to providing scalable, technology-driven tools that help RIAs efficiently manage client assets. The consistent mention of Portfolio Connect across all three years, with incremental enhancements in description, reflects a deliberate effort to position Schwab as a technology-enabled custodian that supports the growth and operational efficiency of independent advisory practices.",

Through Retirement Business Services, retirement plan assets are held at Charles Schwab Trust Bank (Trust Bank) or trusteed by a separate, independent trustee, or through brokerage accounts at CS&amp;Co. Retirement Business Services also offers the Schwab Personal Choice Retirement Account , a self-directed brokerage offering for retirement plans. The Company and independent retirement plan providers work together to serve plan sponsors, combining the consulting and administrative expertise of the administrator with our investment, technology, brokerage, trust, and custodial services. \u00ae\n\nStock Plan Services offers equity compensation stock plan administrators full-service recordkeeping for stock plans, stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, stock appreciation rights, and a full range of participant support services that includes education and investing services to individual equity plan participants. Specialized services for ex ecutive transactions and reporting, corporate actions, grant acceptance tracking, and other services are offered to stock plan administrators to meet the needs of administering the reporting and compliance aspects of an equity compensation plan. Designated Brokerage Services supports employers' needs for employee account surveillance (trading and reporting) through a consultative and best practices approach. Comprehensive single-custodian solutions combine technology with experienced service team members to help compliance professionals manage risk. Single-custodian solutions provide Schwab account trading data via an outbound direct data feed to industry regulated companies' proprietary compliance solutions or third-party compliance monitoring systems.\n\nLastly, we also offer Mutual Fund Clearing Services and Off-Platform Sales. Mutual Fund Clearing Services provides open-end mutual fund trading, settlement, and related transactional services to banks, brokerage firms, and trust companies. Off-Platform Sales offers proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and collective trust funds (CTFs) outside the Company and not on the Schwab platform. They are included within the Investor Services segment given their leveraging of the products and services offered to individual investors.\n\n## Advisor Services\n\nMore than thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry by creating independent firms. Through the Advisor Services segment, Schwab has become one of the largest providers of custodial, trading, banking, and support services to RIAs and their clients. Management believes that we can maintain our competitive position primarily through the efforts of our sales, support, technology, and business consulting teams, which are dedicated to helping RIAs grow, compete, and succeed in serving their clients. In addition to focusing on superior service, we utilize technology to provide RIAs with a highly-developed, scalable platform for administering their clients' assets easily and efficiently. Advisor Services sponsors and hosts a variety of national, regional, local, and virtual events designed to help RIAs of all sizes and complex ities identify and implement better ways to ex pand and efficiently manage their practices.\n\nRIAs who custody client accounts at Schwab may use proprietary software that provides them with up-to-date client account information as well as trading capabilities. The Advisor Services website is the core platform for RIAs to conduct daily business activities online with Schwab, including viewing and managing client account information and accessing news and market information. The website provides account servicing capabilities for RIAs, including account opening, money movement, transfer of assets, trading, checking status, and communicating with our service team.

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab disclosed exposure to U.S. state and municipal securities as part of its investment portfolios, though no specific dollar value was provided in the excerpt. In 2023, the company reported a specific value of $638 million in U.S. state and municipal securities within its Available for Sale securities. By 2024, Schwab continued to list U.S. state and municipal securities as part of its investment portfolios, emphasizing that substantially all securities were rated investment grade. This progression indicates a measured and consistent approach to credit risk, maintaining exposure within a broader context of high-quality, investment-grade holdings.",

The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs.\n\nWe manage compliance risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, privacy, and employment policies.\n\nPrivacy risk is the risk of unauthorized collection, use, storage, or sharing of personal information, including data incidents and other mismanagement of personal information. We manage privacy risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with these laws and regulations.\n\nAnti-money laundering/sanctions risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/global sanctions (collectively, 'AML') laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Schwab manages this risk through daily monitoring, a system of internal controls, education and training for appropriate personnel, and developing risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers.\n\nConduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company's behalf that may result in detriment to the Company's clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company's employees. We manage this risk through policies, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Company's Corporate Responsibility Officer.\n\nFiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.\n\nIncentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to ex pose the Company to material amounts of risk.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our ex posure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments.\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.",

U.S. agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\n\n## Mortgage Lending Portfolio\n\nThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\nOur residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).\n\nSchwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab's bank loans, see Item 8 - Note 7.\n\n## Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios\n\nCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.\n\n## Other Counterparty Exposures\n\nSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab's clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company's risk appetite.\n\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes,",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium evolved from being described primarily as a hybrid advisory service combining robo-advice with access to CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERS into a more integrated and accessible financial planning tool. In 2022, it was highlighted as a service that 'combines unlimited guidance provided by a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER and our robo-advice technology to make financial and investment planning more accessible to investors.' By 2023, Schwab emphasized its role in a broader suite of advisory solutions, noting that it 'offers clients an advisory service which combines our robo-advice technology with unlimited guidance provided by a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER to make financial and investment planning more accessible to investors.' In 2024, the service was positioned within a more comprehensive ecosystem that included Schwab Plan and Schwab Coaching, indicating a strategic shift toward integrating digital planning tools and human guidance. This evolution shows Schwab's increasing focus on making hybrid advisory services more accessible and complementary to self-directed planning tools, aligning with broader trends in digital wealth management.",

      "answer": "BNY Mellon's disclosures across 2022, 2023, and 2024 consistently highlight that its ability to return capital to shareholders is constrained by U.S. banking laws and regulations governing capital adequacy. In 2022, the company emphasized general regulatory oversight impacting operations. By 2023, it specifically reiterated that capital return decisions were limited by U.S. banking laws, Delaware law, and preferred stock dividend obligations. In 2024, the language remained largely unchanged, reiterating the same constraints while also noting the importance of maintaining 'well capitalized' status. This consistent yet evolving emphasis reflects a regulatory environment that continues to impose clear boundaries on BNY Mellon\u2019s capital planning flexibility, signaling ongoing prudential oversight and risk-conscious capital management expectations from regulators over the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's use of the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan evolve from 2022 to 2024 in relation to the introduction of newer performance share and restricted stock unit agreements, and what does this pattern suggest about the company's executive compensation strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan was still actively referenced in filings (BK_10k_2022.pdf, page 20), indicating its ongoing relevance, while newer 2020 and 2021 Performance Share Unit and Restricted Stock Unit Agreements were also being introduced. By 2023, the 2019 Plan remained a core component of the compensation structure (BK_10k_2023.pdf, page 18), with the company continuing to build upon it by incorporating newer agreements like the 2020 Performance Share Unit Agreement. In 2024, the 2019 Plan was still in effect (BK_10k_2024.pdf, page 18), but the company had progressed to implementing 2022 Performance Share Unit Agreements, suggesting a layered approach to executive compensation that preserves foundational plans while adapting to new performance-based structures. This indicates a strategy of continuity with gradual modernization.",

      "question": "How did Charles Schwab's use and pledging of client securities evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of collateral availability, margin loan practices, and securities lending obligations across these years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab disclosed that client securities in margin accounts could be pledged as collateral under federal regulations, with a table summarizing the fair value of such securities available for pledging. In 2023, the company maintained margin loan practices where client securities were used as collateral, with provisions allowing Schwab to pledge these securities, and the company applied a practical expedient under ASC 326 to estimate credit losses based on collateral maintenance. By 2024, Schwab was providing cash collateral to brokerage clients in connection with securities lending activities, and it pledged client securities to meet margin requirements for options transactions cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation. The evolution shows a consistent but expanding role of client securities in Schwab's operational and regulatory framework, with increasing complexity in collateral management and external guarantees.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGuarantees and indemnifications: Schwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation - a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

      "question": "How did Charles Schwab's interactive tools for RIAs evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of third-party integrations and portfolio management capabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab emphasized its proprietary software and online platform for RIAs, including access to third-party platforms supporting client relationship management, portfolio management systems, trade order management, and financial planning. A key offering was Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect, a free portfolio management solution that allowed advisors to manage Schwab accounts without needing to download and reconcile data. By 2023, Schwab continued to highlight these integrations but placed increased emphasis on the Advisor Services website as a core platform for RIAs, offering multi-year document archiving and search capabilities alongside third-party integrations. In 2024, Schwab maintained its focus on technology and platform scalability, reiterating the importance of integrations with third-party platforms and continuing to offer Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect. However, 2024's filing specifically reinforced the intuitive modern experience of the platform, suggesting a refinement or enhancement in usability and feature delivery over the three-year period.",

      "question": "What does the trend in Charles Schwab's exposure to U.S. state and municipal securities from 2022 to 2024 indicate about its investment strategy and risk appetite in the context of evolving market conditions and interest rate risk management?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Charles Schwab maintained a consistent but relatively small exposure to U.S. state and municipal securities, indicating a conservative and stable investment strategy aligned with its broader risk appetite. In 2022, Schwab disclosed holding U.S. state and municipal securities as part of its investment portfolios, which were described as predominantly investment grade and managed to align with interest rate risk policies. In 2023, the company held $638 million in U.S. state and municipal securities within its available-for-sale securities, showing no significant increase despite rising interest rate volatility. By 2024, Schwab again reiterated that its investment portfolios included U.S. state and municipal securities, with substantially all securities rated investment grade, suggesting continued emphasis on credit quality and stability. The consistent positioning implies Schwab did not materially alter its risk appetite or strategy toward municipal securities despite changing market conditions, preferring to maintain a conservative stance in line with its interest rate risk management framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgagebacked securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\n\n## Mortgage Lending Portfolio\n\nThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\nOur residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).\n\nSchwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab's bank loans, see Item 8 - Note 7.\n\n## Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios\n\nCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.\n\n## Other Counterparty Exposures\n\nSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab's clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company's risk appetite.\n\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes,",

The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs.\n\nWe manage compliance risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, privacy, and employment policies.\n\nPrivacy risk is the risk of unauthorized collection, use, storage, or sharing of personal information, including data incidents and other mismanagement of personal information. We manage privacy risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with these laws and regulations.\n\nAnti-money laundering/sanctions risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/global sanctions (collectively, 'AML') laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Schwab manages this risk through daily monitoring, a system of internal controls, education and training for appropriate personnel, and developing risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers.\n\nConduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company's behalf that may result in detriment to the Company's clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company's employees. We manage this risk through policies, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Company's Corporate Responsibility Officer.\n\nFiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.\n\nIncentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to ex pose the Company to material amounts of risk.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our ex posure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments.\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade.

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab had the option under the 2019 IDA agreement to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances annually to its balance sheet, subject to capital sufficiency and other limitations, and it had already moved $10.1 billion by December 31, 2021. In 2023, Schwab did not move any IDA balances to its balance sheet after the 2023 IDA agreement replaced the 2019 agreement, introducing new constraints such as maintaining minimum and maximum IDA balance thresholds. In 2024, Schwab remained under the terms of the 2023 IDA agreement and did not migrate any IDA balances, as the agreement required Schwab to maintain minimum balances above the then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts with a maximum of $30 billion above that total through September 10, 2025.

          "chunk_text": "\nGuarantees and indemnifications: Schwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation - a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We partially satisfy the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which are issued by several banks. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $15 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2021. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign exchange trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees.\n\nIDA agreement: The Company's IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective on October 6, 2020. The IDA agreement creates responsibilities of the Company and certain contingent obligations. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Though unlikely, in the event the sweep arrangement fee computation were to result in a negative amount in any given month, Schwab would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions.\n\nThe IDA agreement also provides that, as of July 1, 2021, Schwab has the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab's balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the IDA agreement, including the requirement that Schwab can only move IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $50 billion IDA balance through June 2031, and at least 80% of the IDA balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.\n\nThe total ending IDA balance was $147.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, and $154.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Were IDA balances to decline below the required IDA balance minimum, Schwab could be required to direct additional sweep cash from its balance sheet to the IDA program. Through December 31, 2021, Schwab had moved $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet, which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the Company moved approximately $10 billion of additional IDA balances to its balance sheet.",

      "answer": "Schwab's hybrid advisory model, embodied in Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium, was introduced in 2022 as a service combining robo-advice technology with unlimited guidance from CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERS. In 2023, the model remained central to Schwab's advisory offerings, with no changes noted in its hybrid structure, suggesting a commitment to balancing automation with human expertise. By 2024, Schwab continued to emphasize the same hybrid model, reinforcing its strategy of making financial and investment planning more accessible through a blend of scalable technology and personalized human interaction. The consistency of the offering across all three years indicates a deliberate approach to scaling personalized services without compromising the accessibility or cost-efficiency enabled by robo-advice.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Visa introduced virtual accounts as part of its Currencycloud platform to enable real-time foreign exchange rates and enhanced liquidity and settlement capabilities. By 2023, Visa expanded the role of virtual accounts within the Visa Direct Platform, integrating them into cross-border payment solutions and increasing the network's reach to over 11 billion endpoints, including cards, bank accounts, and digital wallets. In 2024, Visa continued to build on this infrastructure, leveraging virtual accounts to support new flows and enhance its digitally native Currencycloud capabilities, further optimizing cross-border B2B transactions across more than 100 countries through Visa B2B Connect. This progression shows a strategic deepening of virtual account utility in global money movement.",

Visa  Direct  leverages  Visa's  infrastructure  to  enable  different transaction types and new money flows between parties for a wide range of use cases, such as P2P payments and account-to-account  transfers,  business  and  government  payouts  to  individuals  and  small  businesses,  merchant settlements and refunds. (2)\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we had 5.9 billion Visa Direct transactions, an increase of 36 percent year over year, excluding Russia from both periods, and more than 60 use cases and 2,000 programs. Visa Direct connected 16 card-based networks, 66 automated clearing house (ACH) schemes, 11 real-time payment (RTP) networks and five gateways. With the addition of push-to-wallet capabilities to Visa Direct Payouts, which is an existing service that allows Visa financial institutions  and  its  partners  to  send  push-to-account  and  push-to-card  payouts,  Visa  Direct  will  be  able  to  provide access to nearly 7 billion cards, accounts and digital wallets across more than 190 countries and territories.\n\n## Visa Business Solutions\n\nWe are also extending our network with B2B payments. Our three strategic areas of focus include investing and growing  card-based  payments,  accelerating  our  efforts  in  non-card,  cross-border  payments  and  digitizing  domestic accounts payable and accounts receivable processes. We offer a portfolio of business payment solutions, including small business, corporate (travel) cards, purchasing cards, virtual cards and digital credentials, non-card cross-border B2B payment options and disbursement accounts, covering most major industry segments around the world. Business solutions are designed to bring efficiency, controls and automation to small businesses, commercial and government payment processes, ranging from employee travel to fully integrated, invoice-based payables.\n\nVisa B2B Connect is a multilateral B2B cross-border payments network designed to facilitate transactions from the bank  of  origin  directly  to  the  beneficiary  bank,  helping  streamline  settlement  and  optimize  payments  for  financial institutions' corporate clients. The network delivers B2B cross-border payments that are predictable, flexible, data-rich, secure  and  cost-effective.  Visa  B2B  Connect  continues  to  scale  and  is  available  in  more  than  100  countries  and territories.\n\n## Visa Treasury as a Service\n\nAligned with our global network of networks strategy, we are focused on building the infrastructure that enables our clients to deliver cross-border products and services for their consumers. This includes a series of new solutions for our  established  cross-border  consumer  payments  business  as  well  as  introducing  new  use  cases  enabled  by  our digitally  native  Currencycloud  platform,  which  includes  real-time  foreign  exchange  rates,  virtual  accounts,  and enhanced liquidity and settlement capabilities.\n\nActual  fund  availability  varies  by  receiving  financial  institution,  receiving  account  type,  region  and  whether  the  transaction  is domestic or cross-border.

      "question": "How has Visa's approach to stock class documentation evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly regarding the number of class-specific certificate exhibits included in SEC filings?",
      "answer": "Visa's approach to stock class documentation has simplified over the three-year period. In 2022, the company included three distinct exhibits for stock certificates: class B (4.2) and class C (4.3) common stock. By 2023, only class C common stock (4.2) remained as a separate exhibit, with no mention of class B documentation. In 2024, the filings no longer differentiated between stock classes in the certificate documentation, with only a general 'Form of stock certificate of Visa Inc.' (4.1) listed as the sole exhibit related to stock certificates. This indicates a progressive consolidation of stock class documentation.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Visa introduced virtual accounts as part of its Currencycloud platform under Visa Treasury as a Service, aiming to enable real-time foreign exchange rates and enhanced liquidity and settlement capabilities. By 2023, virtual accounts were more deeply integrated into the Visa Direct platform, which was described as having the potential to reach over 11 billion endpoints, including cards, bank accounts, and digital wallets. In 2024, virtual accounts were further embedded within Visa Commercial Solutions, specifically supporting accounts payable and accounts receivable automation through solutions like the Accounts Receivable Manager virtual card automation in the U.S., while Visa Direct processed nearly 10 billion transactions across more than 550 partners. This progression shows Visa's strategic deepening of virtual accounts' role in both B2B and cross-border payment flows.",

      "question": "How did Visa Inc.'s documentation for stock certificates evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly regarding class-specific distinctions, and what does this evolution indicate about changes in its capital structure?",
      "answer": "Visa Inc.'s documentation for stock certificates underwent a clear evolution between 2022 and 2024. In 2022, both class B and class C common stock certificates were explicitly referenced with class B dated August 5, 2022 (Exhibit 4.2) and class C dated January 28, 2009 (Exhibit 4.3). By 2023, documentation for class B certificates was no longer included, with only class C certificates referenced (Exhibit 4.2) and dated January 28, 2009. This pattern continued in 2024, where only class C certificates remained in the documentation (Exhibit 4.2), maintaining the same January 28, 2009 date. This indicates a simplification of Visa's capital structure, with class B shares being phased out between 2022 and 2023 filings.",

      "question": "How did Charles Schwab's use and management of client securities evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of pledging, collateralization, and off-balance sheet treatment under regulatory requirements and client agreements?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Charles Schwab's handling of client securities evolved significantly. In 2022, Schwab outlined that client securities in margin accounts could be pledged to third parties under federal regulations, with a focus on the fair value of available collateral. By 2023, Schwab provided more detailed disclosures around margin loan collateral, noting that pledged collateral was not reflected on the balance sheet and that the company applied a practical expedient under ASC 326 to estimate credit losses based on collateral maintenance. In 2024, Schwab expanded its use of client securities through the 2023 IDA agreement with TD Depository Institutions, which allowed uninvested client cash to be swept off-balance sheet into deposit accounts at TD, with Schwab maintaining minimum and maximum IDA balances. Additionally, Schwab pledged client securities to meet margin requirements for listed option contracts and provided cash as collateral in securities lending activities. This progression shows a strategic shift toward off-balance sheet treatment and increased reliance on client securities for regulatory and client-related obligations.",

We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

Through Retirement Business Services, retirement plan assets are held at Charles Schwab Trust Bank (Trust Bank) or trusteed by a separate, independent trustee, or through brokerage accounts at CS&amp;Co. Retirement Business Services also offers the Schwab Personal Choice Retirement Account , a self-directed brokerage offering for retirement plans. The Company and independent retirement plan providers work together to serve plan sponsors, combining the consulting and administrative expertise of the administrator with our investment, technology, brokerage, trust, and custodial services. \u00ae\n\nStock Plan Services offers equity compensation stock plan administrators full-service recordkeeping for stock plans, stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, stock appreciation rights, and a full range of participant support services that includes education and investing services to individual equity plan participants. Specialized services for ex ecutive transactions and reporting, corporate actions, grant acceptance tracking, and other services are offered to stock plan administrators to meet the needs of administering the reporting and compliance aspects of an equity compensation plan. Designated Brokerage Services supports employers' needs for employee account surveillance (trading and reporting) through a consultative and best practices approach. Comprehensive single-custodian solutions combine technology with experienced service team members to help compliance professionals manage risk. Single-custodian solutions provide Schwab account trading data via an outbound direct data feed to industry regulated companies' proprietary compliance solutions or third-party compliance monitoring systems.\n\nLastly, we also offer Mutual Fund Clearing Services and Off-Platform Sales. Mutual Fund Clearing Services provides open-end mutual fund trading, settlement, and related transactional services to banks, brokerage firms, and trust companies. Off-Platform Sales offers proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and collective trust funds (CTFs) outside the Company and not on the Schwab platform. They are included within the Investor Services segment given their leveraging of the products and services offered to individual investors.\n\n## Advisor Services\n\nMore than thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry by creating independent firms. Through the Advisor Services segment, Schwab has become one of the largest providers of custodial, trading, banking, and support services to RIAs and their clients. Management believes that we can maintain our competitive position primarily through the efforts of our sales, support, technology, and business consulting teams, which are dedicated to helping RIAs grow, compete, and succeed in serving their clients. In addition to focusing on superior service, we utilize technology to provide RIAs with a highly-developed, scalable platform for administering their clients' assets easily and efficiently. Advisor Services sponsors and hosts a variety of national, regional, local, and virtual events designed to help RIAs of all sizes and complex ities identify and implement better ways to ex pand and efficiently manage their practices.\n\nRIAs who custody client accounts at Schwab may use proprietary software that provides them with up-to-date client account information as well as trading capabilities. The Advisor Services website is the core platform for RIAs to conduct daily business activities online with Schwab, including viewing and managing client account information and accessing news and market information. The website provides account servicing capabilities for RIAs, including account opening, money movement, transfer of assets, trading, checking status, and communicating with our service team.

      "question": "How did Charles Schwab's exposure to U.S. state and municipal securities evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend reveal about the firm's credit risk management strategy in its investment portfolios?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Charles Schwab disclosed exposure to U.S. state and municipal securities as part of its investment portfolios but did not specify a dollar amount, noting that substantially all securities were rated investment grade as of December 31, 2021. In 2023, Schwab reported a specific value of $638 million for U.S. state and municipal securities within its available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022. By 2024, Schwab reiterated its exposure to these securities and emphasized that substantially all portfolio securities remained investment grade, indicating a consistent credit risk management strategy focused on maintaining high credit quality. This evolution reveals a deliberate and stable investment approach, prioritizing credit quality and risk mitigation in the context of municipal securities.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgagebacked securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\n\n## Mortgage Lending Portfolio\n\nThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\nOur residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).\n\nSchwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab's bank loans, see Item 8 - Note 7.\n\n## Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios\n\nCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.\n\n## Other Counterparty Exposures\n\nSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab's clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company's risk appetite.\n\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes,",

The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs.\n\nWe manage compliance risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, privacy, and employment policies.\n\nPrivacy risk is the risk of unauthorized collection, use, storage, or sharing of personal information, including data incidents and other mismanagement of personal information. We manage privacy risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with these laws and regulations.\n\nAnti-money laundering/sanctions risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/global sanctions (collectively, 'AML') laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Schwab manages this risk through daily monitoring, a system of internal controls, education and training for appropriate personnel, and developing risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers.\n\nConduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company's behalf that may result in detriment to the Company's clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company's employees. We manage this risk through policies, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Company's Corporate Responsibility Officer.\n\nFiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.\n\nIncentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to ex pose the Company to material amounts of risk.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our ex posure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments.\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.",

      "question": "How did Schwab's utilization of the IDA agreement for migrating IDA balances to its balance sheet evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what changes in contractual flexibility or constraints occurred across these years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab had the option under the 2019 IDA agreement to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances annually to its balance sheet, and it had already moved $10.1 billion by December 31, 2021, including $10 billion subsequent to that date. In 2023, the 2019 IDA agreement was replaced by the 2023 IDA agreement, which eliminated the requirement that at least 80% of IDA balances be fixed-rate obligations, but Schwab did not migrate any IDA balances to its balance sheet that year. In 2024, Schwab continued to operate under the 2023 IDA agreement, maintaining restrictions on balance migration based on capital sufficiency and balance thresholds, and again did not move any IDA balances to its balance sheet. This shows a shift from active migration in 2022 to a more constrained and passive approach in 2023 and 2024, despite increased contractual flexibility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [SCHW](2022) \u2192 [Recordkeeping Services]: Schwab had migrated $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet by the end of 2021 and an additional $10 billion after December 31, 2021, under the 2019 IDA agreement, which allowed up to $10 billion annually.",
        "Hop 2: [SCHW](2023) \u2192 [Recordkeeping Services]: The 2019 IDA agreement was replaced by the 2023 IDA agreement, which removed the 80% fixed-rate obligation requirement, but Schwab did not migrate any IDA balances in 2023.",
        "Hop 3: [SCHW](2024) \u2192 [Recordkeeping Services]: Under the 2023 IDA agreement, Schwab remained subject to balance thresholds and capital constraints and again did not migrate any IDA balances to its balance sheet in 2024."

          "chunk_text": "\nGuarantees and indemnifications: Schwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation - a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We partially satisfy the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which are issued by several banks. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $15 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2021. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign exchange trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees.\n\nIDA agreement: The Company's IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective on October 6, 2020. The IDA agreement creates responsibilities of the Company and certain contingent obligations. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Though unlikely, in the event the sweep arrangement fee computation were to result in a negative amount in any given month, Schwab would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions.\n\nThe IDA agreement also provides that, as of July 1, 2021, Schwab has the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab's balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the IDA agreement, including the requirement that Schwab can only move IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $50 billion IDA balance through June 2031, and at least 80% of the IDA balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.\n\nThe total ending IDA balance was $147.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, and $154.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Were IDA balances to decline below the required IDA balance minimum, Schwab could be required to direct additional sweep cash from its balance sheet to the IDA program. Through December 31, 2021, Schwab had moved $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet, which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the Company moved approximately $10 billion of additional IDA balances to its balance sheet.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGuarantees and indemnifications: Schwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation - a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nmanaged account offerings have been made available to retail clients beginning in 2021, including two positive impact strategies and a multi-sector income strategy. The positive impact strategies utilize socially responsible investing, or a general investing strategy that considers not only traditional measures of risk and return, but environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors as well. We also refer investors who want to utilize a specific third-party money manager to direct a portion of their investment assets to the Schwab Managed Account program. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios , available since 2015, are for clients who are looking to have their assets professionally managed via a fully automated online investment advisory service. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium , a hybrid advisory service, offers clients an advisory service which combines unlimited guidance provided by a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER and our robo-advice technology to make financial and investment planning more accessible to investors. Schwab Intelligent Income is a low-cost solution designed to offer a simple, modern way to generate income from existing investment portfolios. \u2122 \u00ae \u00ae \u2122 \u00ae\n\nClients of TD Ameritrade also have access to a suite of programs designed to meet their specific investment advisory needs. TDA's Selective Portfolios offers a broader range of goal-oriented portfolios made up of mutual funds and ETFs, through a combination of automated technology and professional insights. TDA's Personalized Portfolios offers clients tailored portfolios, supported by a team of investment professionals. Finally, TDA's AdvisorDirect referral program provides clients with an introduction to an independent RIA that can assist in developing customized investment strategies around their unique goals. \u00ae\n\nFurther, given our belief in the importance of financial planning, we offer a broad set of planning capabilities addressing a variety of planning needs. Our solutions include simple, free digital retirement calculators, our complimentary Digital Schwab Plan available to all Schwab clients, as well as more complex planning solutions that are delivered by a Schwab representative who takes into account a client's personal and financial goals to build a tailored financial plan. \u00ae\n\nTo meet the specific needs of clients who actively trade, Schwab offers integrated web- and software-based trading platforms, realtime market data, options trading, premium stock and futures research, and multi-channel access, as well as sophisticated account and trade management features, risk management and decision support tools, and dedicated personal support. For example, clients that trade more actively can use these channels to access highly competitive pricing, expert tools, and extensive service capabilities - including experienced, knowledgeable teams of trading specialists, and integrated product offerings. TD Ameritrade offers clients the robust thinkorswim trading platform designed for the specialized needs of active traders, the Trading Learning Center to help build client knowledge through sequenced courses, the TDA Network, in-house financial network programming, and a trading community platform allowing traders to share ideas. \u00ae\n\nFor U.S. clients wishing to invest in foreign equities, Schwab offers a suite of global investing capabilities, including online access to certain foreign equity markets with the ability to trade in their local currencies. In addition, Schwab serves both foreign investors and non-English-speaking U.S. clients who wish to trade or invest in U.S. dollar-based securities.\n\nWe also offer clients a range of self-service education and support tools, providing quick and efficient access to a broad lineup of information, research, tools, and administrative services, which clients can access according to their needs. Educational tools include workshops, webcasts, podcasts, interactive courses, and online information about investing, from which Schwab does not earn revenue. Since 2020, we've maintained virtual events to engage with retail and institutional clients amidst an unprecedented climate. Additionally, we provide various online research and analysis tools that are designed to help clients achieve better investment outcomes. As an example of analysis tools available to clients, Schwab Equity Ratings is a quantitative model-based stock rating system that provides all clients with ratings on approximately 3,000 stocks, assigning each equity a single grade: A, B, C, D, or F. Schwab Equity Ratings International , an international ranking methodology, covers stocks of approximately 4,000 foreign companies. Another example of expanding access to investing includes Schwab Stock Slices\u2122, a service which enables investors to purchase a single stock slice, or up to 10 different stock slices at once, from the S&amp;P 500 commission-free through our online channels. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also offer equity compensation plan sponsors full-service recordkeeping for stock plans, stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, stock appreciation rights, and a full range of participant support services through our Stock Plan Services business unit. Specialized services for executive transactions and reporting, grant acceptance tracking, and other services are offered to employers to meet the needs of administering the reporting and compliance aspects of an equity compensation plan.\n\nOur Retirement Plan Services business unit offers a bundled 401(k) retirement plan product that provides retirement plan sponsors with extensive investment options, trustee or custodial services, and participant-level recordkeeping.
