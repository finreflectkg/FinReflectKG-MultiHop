          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nRoyalty  income  in  2021  on  patent  and  know-how  licenses  and  other  rights  amounted  to  $286  million.  Merck  also incurred royalty expenses amounting to $2.4 billion in 2021 under patent and know-how licenses it holds.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe Company's business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for existing products through a  strong  research  and  development  program.  At  December  31,  2021,  approximately  17,500  people  were  employed  in  the Company's research  activities. The  Company  prioritizes  its  research  and  development  efforts  and  focuses  on  candidates  that  it believes represent breakthrough science that will make a difference for patients and payers.\n\nThe  Company  maintains  a  number  of  long-term  exploratory  and  fundamental  research  programs  in  biology  and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. The Company's research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the Company's research and development resources  on  candidates  the  Company  believes  are  capable  of  providing  unambiguous,  promotable  advantages  to  patients  and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. Merck  is  pursuing  emerging  product  opportunities  independent  of  therapeutic  area  or  modality  (small  molecule,  biologics  and vaccines) and is building its biologics capabilities. The Company is committed to ensuring that externally sourced programs remain an important component of its pipeline strategy, with a focus on supplementing its internal research with a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies.\n\nThe  Company's  clinical  pipeline  includes  candidates  in  multiple  disease  areas,  including  cancer,  cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, neurosciences, respiratory diseases, and vaccines.\n\nIn  the  development  of  human  health  products,  industry  practice  and  government  regulations  in  the  U.S.  and  most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through pre-clinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug or vaccine may be marketed in the U.S., recorded data on pre-clinical and clinical experience are included in the New Drug Application (NDA) for a drug or the Biologics License Application (BLA) for a vaccine or biologic submitted to the FDA for the required approval.\n\nOnce the Company's scientists discover a new small molecule compound or biologic that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition, the Company commences pre-clinical testing with that compound. Pre-clinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry, pharmacology, immunogenicity and toxicology. Pending acceptable pre-clinical  data,  the  Company  will  initiate  clinical  testing  in  accordance  with  established  regulatory  requirements. The  clinical testing  begins  with  Phase  1  studies,  which  are  designed  to  assess  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics,  and  preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans. If favorable, additional, larger Phase 2 studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population, define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects  that  could  limit  the  compound's  usefulness.  In  some  situations,  the  clinical  program  incorporates  adaptive  design methodology  to  use  accumulating  data  to  decide  how  to  modify  aspects  of  the  ongoing  clinical  study  as  it  continues,  without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. One type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a/2b trial design, a twostage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b dose-optimization finding stage. If data from the Phase 2 trials are satisfactory, the Company commences large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the compound's efficacy and safety. Another  type  of  adaptive  clinical  trial  is  an  adaptive  Phase  2/3  trial  design,  a  study  that  includes  an  interim  analysis  and  an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a Phase 2 study (e.g. multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial. An adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design reduces timelines by eliminating activities which would be required to start a separate  study.  Upon  completion  of  Phase  3  trials,  if  satisfactory,  the  Company  submits  regulatory  filings  with  the  appropriate regulatory  agencies  around  the  world  to  have  the  product  candidate  approved  for  marketing.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.",

(1)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nDuring 2021, Merck delivered on its strategic priorities by executing commercially to drive strong revenue and earnings growth  in  the  year,  completing  key  business  development  transactions,  accelerating  its  broad  pipeline,  and  achieving  notable regulatory milestones. Also, on June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of Organon. The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off.\n\nWorldwide sales were $48.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 17% compared with 2020, or 16% excluding the favorable effect of foreign exchange. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care and animal health. Additionally,  revenue  in  2021  reflects  the  benefit  of  sales  of  molnupiravir,  an  investigational  oral  antiviral  COVID-19 treatment. As discussed below, COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected sales in 2021, but to a lesser extent than in 2020, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.\n\nMerck continues to execute scientifically  compelling  business  development  opportunities  to  augment  its  pipeline.  In November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company evaluating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins through the development of pulmonary and hematologic therapies. In April  2021,  Merck  acquired  Pandion Therapeutics,  Inc.  (Pandion),  a  clinical-stage  biotechnology  company  developing  novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, Merck entered into a collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV.\n\nIn  2021,  Merck  received  over  30  approvals  and  filed  over  20  New  Drug  Applications  (NDAs)  and  supplemental Biologics License Applications (BLAs) across the U.S., the EU, Japan and China. During 2021, the Company received numerous regulatory approvals within oncology. Keytruda received approval for additional indications in the U.S. and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of breast, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, esophageal, melanoma and renal cell cancers, as  well  as  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  the  therapeutic  areas  of  breast,  cervical,  gastric  or  gastroesophageal  junction cancers. Keytruda was also approved in combination with Lenvima both for the treatment of certain adult patients with endometrial cancer  and  for  the  treatment  of  renal  cell  cancer.  Lenvima  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  Eisai  Co.,  Ltd.  (Eisai). Lynparza,  which  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  AstraZeneca  PLC  (AstraZeneca),  received  approval  in  China  as monotherapy for the treatment of certain adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Welireg (belzutifan), an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)",

      "answer": "In 2023, AbbVie faced significant risks to its market exclusivity due to potential patent challenges and expirations, which could have led to revenue loss from generic competition. In response, AbbVie strategically expanded its patent rights portfolio in 2024 through the acquisitions of Cerevel Therapeutics and ImmunoGen. The Cerevel acquisition brought an exclusive global license under certain Pfizer patent rights, with potential milestone payments up to $1.6 billion and tiered royalties on net revenues. The ImmunoGen acquisition added Elahere, a first-in-class ADC for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and a pipeline of next-generation ADCs, for a total consideration of $9.8 billion. These acquisitions demonstrate how AbbVie leveraged its awareness of patent vulnerability in 2023 to proactively strengthen its patent rights and market exclusivity in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "AbbVie also assumed a licensing agreement entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) prior to the acquisition. Under the agreement, Cerevel Therapeutics was granted an exclusive global license under certain Pfizer patent rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds included i n Cerevel Therapeutic's pipeline. AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $1.6 billion upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones for all programs. Additionally, AbbVie will pay tiered royalties on net revenues.\n\nFollowing the acquisition date, the operating results of Cerevel Therapeutics have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2024, operating losses attributable to Cerevel Therapeutics were $4.9 billion, inclusive of an intangible asset i mpairment charge of $4.5 billion related to emraclidine. See Note 7 for additional information. Operating losses attributable to Cerevel Therapeutics also i ncluded $161 million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for Cerevel Therapeutics employee incentive awards. AbbVie issued 0.3 million RSUs to holders of Cerevel Therapeutics equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to RSUs issued at the acquisition date was not significant.\n\nAcquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of ImmunoGen. ImmunoGen is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) for cancer patients. ImmunoGen's oncology portfolio includes i ts  fl a gs hi p cancer therapy Elahere, a first-in-class ADC approved for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and a pipeline of promising next-generation ADC's targeting hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The combination accelerates AbbVie's entry into the solid tumor space and strengthens its oncology pipeline. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie acquired all outstanding shares of ImmunoGen for $31.26 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred to owners of ImmunoGen common stock was $9.8 billion ($9.2 billion, net of cash acquired).\n\nThe acquisition of ImmunoGen has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the three months ended December 31, 2024.\n\nThe following table summarizes the final fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the expiration timeline for Trulicity's data protection in key jurisdictions influence LLY's intellectual property compliance strategy in 2024 compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, LLY's Trulicity had data protection expiring in 2024 (major European countries) and 2023 (Japan), signaling near-term vulnerability in those markets. By 2024, LLY acknowledged that Trulicity would lose significant patent and remaining data protections in the next few years, which prompted a strategic emphasis on managing intellectual property compliance and preparing for potential biosimilar competition. This shift reflects a proactive response to the evolving protection landscape, as LLY highlighted the complexity of maintaining market exclusivity due to the interaction between patent and regulatory exclusivity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2023) \u2192 Trulicity: Trulicity's data protection in 2023 was set to expire in 2024 in major European countries and had already expired in Japan in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Trulicity \u2192 Data Protection: Trulicity's data protection expiration timeline was identified as a key risk in 2024, with the company noting that it would lose significant patent and data protections in the coming years.",
        "Hop 3: Data Protection \u2190 LLY(2024): LLY's 2024 compliance strategy emphasized the unpredictability of market exclusivity durations and the importance of managing intellectual property in light of expiring protections."

          "chunk_text": "Moreover, the negotiating power of health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation, regulatory, and other market impacts, and they, along with gov ernments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion, or fav orable formulary placement. Such stakeholders hav e also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to limit access to our products. As these practices expand, including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. priv ate third-party payers, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitiv e and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\nPharmacy benefit manager practices hav e come under increased scrutiny from U.S. policymakers at the federal and state lev el who hav e proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact that these intermediaries hav e on drug pricing and patients' out of pocket costs. If promulgated, such legislation could hav e resultant implications, costs, or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see Item 1, \"Business-U.S. Priv ate Sector Dynamics\" and \"Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access-U.S.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\n- We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted, and in the future is likely to continue to result, in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products.\n\nIn the ordinary course of their lifecycles, our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S., as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S., after a specified period of time. For example, Trulicity will lose significant patent and remaining data protections in the next few years. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We hav e faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection.\n\nFor non-biologic products, loss of exclusiv ity typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and sev ere decline in rev enues, especially in the U.S. Generic pharmaceutical companies hav e in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation. For biologics, loss of exclusiv ity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor v ersions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including dev elopment timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approv al pathways.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often inv olv e complex legal, scientific and factual questions. There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found v alid and enforceable if challenged. Third parties may challenge, inv alidate, or circumv ent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not be deemed to infringe our patents. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes may not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternativ e processes or marketing alternativ e products or formulations that compete with our patented products. Patents held by third-parties hav e also contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all potential indications for a product candidate. In addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activ ities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Executiv e Ov erv iew-Other Matters-Patent Matters\" and Item 1, \"Business-Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,\" for more details.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's HMO and insurance subsidiaries were subject to regulatory requirements that restricted dividend payments and required maintenance of certain equity levels, resulting in $1.6 billion of gross dividends paid in 2021 but with additional limitations in place. These constraints were partly a result of undertakings made during the Aetna acquisition that required regulatory approval for future dividend distributions.

Also, on June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of Organon. The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off.\n\nWorldwide sales were $48.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 17% compared with 2020, or 16% excluding the favorable effect of foreign exchange. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care and animal health. Additionally,  revenue  in  2021  reflects  the  benefit  of  sales  of  molnupiravir,  an  investigational  oral  antiviral  COVID-19 treatment. As discussed below, COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected sales in 2021, but to a lesser extent than in 2020, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.\n\nMerck continues to execute scientifically  compelling  business  development  opportunities  to  augment  its  pipeline.  In November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company evaluating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins through the development of pulmonary and hematologic therapies. In April  2021,  Merck  acquired  Pandion Therapeutics,  Inc.  (Pandion),  a  clinical-stage  biotechnology  company  developing  novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, Merck entered into a collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV.\n\nIn  2021,  Merck  received  over  30  approvals  and  filed  over  20  New  Drug  Applications  (NDAs)  and  supplemental Biologics License Applications (BLAs) across the U.S., the EU, Japan and China. During 2021, the Company received numerous regulatory approvals within oncology. Keytruda received approval for additional indications in the U.S. and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of breast, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, esophageal, melanoma and renal cell cancers, as  well  as  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  the  therapeutic  areas  of  breast,  cervical,  gastric  or  gastroesophageal  junction cancers. Keytruda was also approved in combination with Lenvima both for the treatment of certain adult patients with endometrial cancer  and  for  the  treatment  of  renal  cell  cancer.  Lenvima  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  Eisai  Co.,  Ltd.  (Eisai). Lynparza,  which  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  AstraZeneca  PLC  (AstraZeneca),  received  approval  in  China  as monotherapy for the treatment of certain adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Welireg (belzutifan), an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)",

      "answer": "In 2022, Humira accounted for 37% of AbbVie's total net revenues, reflecting its dominant position in the immunology market despite the emergence of biosimilar competition in Europe and other regions. By 2023, Humira\u2019s revenue contribution had declined to 27%, indicating a significant drop in relative importance to AbbVie\u2019s revenue base. This decline aligns with the intensification of biosimilar competition globally, as noted in the 2023 filing, which stated that Humira was now facing direct biosimilar pressure worldwide. The drop in Humira\u2019s revenue share suggests that AbbVie may have been accelerating its efforts to diversify its product portfolio to offset the expected revenue erosion from its flagship drug.",

          "chunk_text": "and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products, JAK inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available HCV treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded conventional (small-molecule) pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVie's competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie's products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases.\n\nBiosimilars. Competition for AbbVie's biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as 'biosimilars.' Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for small molecule medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products.\n\nHumira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products.\n\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the regulations implementing these statutes. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies.\n\nFurthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\n\nGenerally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie's intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a 'patent term restoration,' for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration.\n\nPharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity.

      "answer": "In 2023, BMY expressed uncertainty about maintaining full market exclusivity for its products, citing risks from generic competition and regulatory pressures, particularly noting that 'there is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period' disclosed in their estimates. By 2024, this risk materialized in the form of ongoing litigation over Eliquis patents in Europe, where BMY faced mixed outcomes: while they won cases in Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, they lost in the UK and faced appeals in France, Czech Republic, and Netherlands. These developments indicate that the company's market exclusivity was indeed compromised in some markets, aligning with the earlier risk warnings but also showing a concrete evolution from a general concern to specific legal battles affecting revenue protection. The litigation outcomes in 2024 demonstrate how patent rights directly influenced market exclusivity, validating the 2023 risk statements with real-world impacts in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "Abraxane Abraxane (paclitax el albumin-bound particles for injectable suspension) is a solvent-free protein-bound chemotherapy product that combines paclitaxel with  albumin  using  our  proprietary Nab technology platform, and is used to treat breast cancer,  NSCLC and pancreatic cancer, among others. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries primarily covering our products. We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn  the  pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. A product's market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes provided by regulatory exclusivity, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic or biosimilar copy. Regulatory exclusivity can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.\n\nWhen these patent rights and other forms of exclusivity expire and generic versions of a medicine are approved and marketed, there are often substantial and rapid declines in the sales of the original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic medicines on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific  aspects  of  the  law  governing  market  patent  protection  and  regulatory  ex clusivity  for  pharmaceuticals  vary  from  country  to  country.  The  following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovator company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, apply to the government to restore lost patent term by extending the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the  U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical product, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity as discussed below. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic ex clusivity.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor  seeking  to  launch  a  generic  substitute  of  a  chemical  innovative  drug  in  the  U.S.  must  file  an ANDA  with  the  FDA.  In  the ANDA,  the  generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.",

While the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies BMS is subject to are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, we do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on  BMS' financial position or liquidity, though they could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of one or more of the matters described below or that any other or future lawsuits, claims, government investigations, or other legal proceedings will not be material to BMS's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for a particular period. Furthermore, failure to successfully enforce BMS's patent rights would likely result in substantial decreases in the respective product revenues from generic competition.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, BMS is unable to assess the outcome of the respective matters nor is it able to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result for such matters. Contingency accruals are recognized when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably  estimated.  Developments  in  legal  proceedings  and  other  matters  that  could  cause  changes  in  the  amounts  previously  accrued  are  evaluated  each reporting period.

Litigations are pending or have been concluded in: Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.\n\nTrials or preliminary proceedings on the merits have been held in: Czech Republic, Finland, France, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. To date BMS has obtained decisions in the following countries:\n\n- BMS obtained a final negative decision in the UK, and generics are now on the market in this country.\n- BMS obtained final positive decisions in Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n- BMS obtained initial  negative  decisions  in  Finland,  Ireland,  and  Slovakia.  In  Finland  and  Slovakia,  appeals  are  pending.  In  Ireland,  the  appeals  court remanded the case to the lower court for rehearing.\n- BMS obtained initial positive decisions in the Czech Republic, France, and Netherlands, and appeals are pending in all three countries.\n- In  Spain,  the  Barcelona  Commercial  Court  found  the  composition-of-matter  patent  for Eliquis and  its  associated  SPC  invalid.  BMS  appealed,  and  the Barcelona Court of Appeal overturned the decision. The generic products that launched at risk after the Barcelona Commercial Court were either enjoined or removed from the market as a result of the Barcelona Court of Appeal ruling. An appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.\n- In  Finland,  generics  have  entered  the  market  while  proceedings  are  pending.  In  Portugal,  BMS  obtained  preliminary  injunctions  against  two  generic companies, but one generic company remains on the market while proceedings are pending.\n\nGeneric manufacturers may seek to market generic versions of Eliquis in additional countries in Europe prior to the expiration of our patents, which may lead to additional infringement and invalidity actions involving Eliquis patents being filed in various countries in Europe.\n\n## Plavix* - Australia\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, BMS and Sanofi were involved in patent litigation with a generic company seeking to launch clopidogrel bisulfate 75 mg tablets in Australia. While BMS and Sanofi obtained an initially favorable decision and an injunction, that decision was overturned on appeal. In 2013, the Australian government intervened seeking damages, which would have been split between BMS and Sanofi, for alleged losses experienced for paying a higher price for branded Plavix* during the period when the injunction was in place. BMS and Sanofi disputed that the Australian government is entitled to any damages. The trial court issued a decision dismissing the Australian government's claim for damages, the Australian government appealed, and the Federal Court issued a ruling in BMS and Sanofi's favor, which was affirmed in December 2024, by the High Court of Australia.\n\n## Pomalyst - U.S.\n\nIn  December  2024,  Celgene  received  a  Notice  Letter  from  Cipla  USA,  Inc.  ('Cipla')  notifying  Celgene  that  Cipla  had  filed  an ANDA  containing  paragraph  IV certifications seeking approval to market generic pomalidomide products in the U.S. In response, Celgene initiated a patent infringement action against Cipla in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, asserting certain FDA Orange Book-listed patents.

      "answer": "In 2023, MRK successfully defended its patent rights for Bridion through litigation and settlement agreements, securing market exclusivity until January 2026. This legal strategy provided a clear extension of exclusivity despite generic challenges. In contrast, by 2024, MRK experienced significant sales declines in Januvia and Janumet due to the loss of market exclusivity in Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada, with U.S. exclusivity now expected to end in May 2026 for Januvia and Janumet, and July 2026 for Janumet XR.

We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn  the  pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. A product's market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes provided by regulatory exclusivity, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic or biosimilar copy. Regulatory exclusivity can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.\n\nWhen these patent rights and other forms of exclusivity expire and generic versions of a medicine are approved and marketed, there are often substantial and rapid declines in the sales of the original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic medicines on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific  aspects  of  the  law  governing  market  patent  protection  and  regulatory  ex clusivity  for  pharmaceuticals  vary  from  country  to  country.  The  following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovator company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, apply to the government to restore lost patent term by extending the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the  U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical product, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity as discussed below. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic ex clusivity.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor  seeking  to  launch  a  generic  substitute  of  a  chemical  innovative  drug  in  the  U.S.  must  file  an ANDA  with  the  FDA.  In  the ANDA,  the  generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.",

A s a result of this provision, the Company paid state M edicaid programs more in rebates than it received on M edicaid sales of Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR in 2024.\n\nIn early 2025, M erck lowered the list price of the Januvia family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount M erck pays to M edicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing, which will be partially offset by continuing volume declines. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products in 2025 compared with 2024.\n\nWhile the key U.S. patent for Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see  Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that Januvia and Janumet will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until M ay  2026 and Janumet XR will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company's sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA . A dditionally , i n 2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Januvia would be included in the first y ear of the IRA 's Program. Pursuant to the IRA 's Program, a government price was set for Januvia , which will become effective on January 1, 2026. A lso, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Janumet and Janumet XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA 's Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA 's Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). A s a result of the anticipated patent expiries in 2026, the government price setting in 2026 and 2027 noted above, as well as ongoing competitive pressures, the Company anticipates significant sales declines for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR in the U.S. in 2026 and thereafter.\n\nThe Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in  all  of  the  EU and for Janumet in some European countries in September 2022. Exclusivity for Janumet was lost in other European countries in A pril 2023. A ccordingly , the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue.

By 2024, BMY continued to partner with Ono, but the focus in the collaboration pipeline had shifted to other products like OPDIVO, YERVOY, and OPDUALAG, with no explicit mention of Orencia in the updated partnership structure.

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie's collaboration with Janssen Biotech involved a cost-sharing structure where Janssen covered approximately 60% of development costs and AbbVie 40%, with equal profit and loss sharing in the U.S. and abroad. By 2024, this structure remained intact, but the collaboration introduced potential future development, regulatory, and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie, indicating a shift toward greater upside potential for AbbVie in later-stage outcomes.

For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal research and development (R&amp;D) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to R&amp;D expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.1 billion in 2019.\n\n## Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits\n\nAbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are generally amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five-year period.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\n## Cash and Equivalents\n\nCash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.",

MORAb-202 is currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for solid tumors.\n\nThe parties will jointly develop and commercialize MORAb-202 in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Russia, Japan, China and certain other countries in the Asia-Pacific region (the 'collaboration territory'). Eisai will be responsible for the global manufacturing and supply.  Profits,  research  and  development  and  commercialization  costs  are  shared  in  the  collaboration  territories.  BMS  will  be responsible for development and commercialization outside of the collaboration territory and will pay a royalty on those sales.\n\nA $650 million up-front collaboration fee was included in Research and development expense in 2021. BMS is also obligated to pay  up  to $2.5 billion upon  the achievement  of  contingent development,  regulatory and  sales-based milestones.  Cost reimbursements were not material.\n\n## Otsuka\n\nBMS and Otsuka  co-promoted Sprycel in  the  U.S.  and  the  EU  through  2019.  BMS  was  responsible  for  the  development  and manufacture of the product and was also the principal in the end customer product sales. A fee was paid to Otsuka through 2020 based on net sales levels in the Oncology Territory (U.S., Japan and the EU) that equated to $294 million on the first $1.0 billion of annual net sales plus 1% of net sales in excess of $1.0 billion.\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, Otsuka was no longer co-promoting Sprycel in the U.S. and as a result, this arrangement was no longer considered a collaboration under ASC 808. Revenues earned and fees paid to Otsuka in the Oncology Territory in 2021 and 2020 are not included in the selected financial information table above.\n\nIn 2019, revenues earned from the Otsuka alliance were $1.8 billion and payments to Otsuka of $302 million were recorded in Cost of product sold.\n\n## Note 4. ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, LICENSING AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Business Combination\n\n## Celgene\n\nOn November 20, 2019, BMS completed the Celgene acquisition. The acquisition is expected to further position BMS as a leading biopharmaceutical  company  for  sustained  innovation  and  long-term  growth  and  to  address  the  needs  of  patients  with  cancer, inflammatory, immunologic or cardiovascular diseases through high-value innovative medicines and leading scientific capabilities. Each share of Celgene common stock was converted into a right to receive one share of BMS common stock and $50.00 in cash. Celgene  shareholders  also  received  one  tradeable  contingent  value  right  ('CVR')  for  each  share  of  Celgene  common  stock representing the right to receive $9.00 in cash, subject to the achievement of future regulatory milestones.\n\nThe aggregate cash paid in connection with the Celgene acquisition was $35.7 billion (or $24.6 billion net of cash acquired). BMS funded the acquisition through cash on-hand and debt proceeds.\n\nThe  transaction  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination  which  requires  that  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  be recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The assessment of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized in 2020.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY emphasized that market exclusivity for its pharmaceutical products was largely determined by patent rights and regulatory data protection, with specific mention of the importance of Orange Book-listed patents and Paragraph IV certifications in the U.S. and varying regulatory protections across global markets. By 2024, BMY was actively litigating patent disputes in over 20 European countries regarding Eliquis, with mixed outcomes\u2014some favorable (e.g., Norway, Sweden, Switzerland) and some negative (e.g., UK, Finland, Ireland), allowing generic entry. In the U.S., a Paragraph IV certification for Pomalyst triggered a patent infringement lawsuit in late 2024. These developments show that while BMY successfully defended some patents, the erosion of patent rights in key markets led to increased generic competition, directly affecting market exclusivity and posing financial risk through revenue loss.",

          "chunk_text": "The U.S., EU and Japan each provide regulatory data protection, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic copy. In certain markets where patent protection  and  other  forms  of  market  exclusivity  may  have  expired,  regulatory  data  protection  can  be  of  particular  importance. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data protection exclusivity on the basis of the competitor's own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to  that  marketed  by  the  innovator. When  these  patent  rights  and  other  forms  of  exclusivity  expire  and  generic versions  of  a  medicine  are  approved  and  marketed,  there  are  often  substantial  and  rapid  declines  in  the  sales  of  the  original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic competition on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity and data regulatory protection for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country. The following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the  innovator  may,  depending  on  a  number  of  factors,  apply  to  the  government  to  restore  lost  patent  term  by  extending  the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If  the  innovative  pharmaceutical  is  a  chemical  product,  the  company  files  an  NDA.  If  the  medicine  is  a  biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity. The type of application filed can affect regulatory data protection exclusivity rights as discussed below.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the U.S. must file an aNDA with the FDA. In the aNDA, the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The aNDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.\n\nAn innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an aNDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an aNDA and allege that  one  or  more  of  the  patents  listed  in  the  Orange  Book  under  an  innovator's  NDA  is  invalid,  unenforceable,  or  will  not  be infringed  by  the  generic  product. This  allegation  is  commonly  known  as  a  Paragraph  IV  certification. The  innovator  then  must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, aNDAs including Paragraph IV certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these aNDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines  approved  under  an  NDA  can  also  receive  several  types  of  regulatory  data  protection.  An  innovative  chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory data protection in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, as described above, a generic manufacturer may file its aNDA after the fourth year of the five-year regulatory data protection period. A pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an NDA, but is approved in, for example, a new formulation or a new route of administration, but not  for  the  drug  itself,  or  for  a  new  indication  on  the  basis  of  new  clinical  studies,  may  receive  three  years  of  regulatory  data protection for that formulation, route of administration, or indication.",

We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which  the  product  has  market  exclusivity. A  product's  market  exclusivity  is  generally  determined  by  two  forms  of  intellectual property:  patent  rights  held  by  the  innovator  company  and  any  regulatory  forms  of  exclusivity  to  which  the  innovative  drug  is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to  exclude  others  from  practicing  an  invention  related  to  the  medicine.  Patents  may  cover,  among  other  things,  the  active ingredient(s),  various  uses  of  a  drug  product,  pharmaceutical  formulations,  drug  delivery  mechanisms  and  processes  for  (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory data protection exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, in the U.S., EU, Japan and certain other countries, RDP exclusivity rights are offered as incentives for research on medicines for rare diseases, or orphan drugs, and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. These incentives can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.",

Litigations are pending or have been concluded in: Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.\n\nTrials or preliminary proceedings on the merits have been held in: Czech Republic, Finland, France, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. To date BMS has obtained decisions in the following countries:\n\n- BMS obtained a final negative decision in the UK, and generics are now on the market in this country.\n- BMS obtained final positive decisions in Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n- BMS obtained initial  negative  decisions  in  Finland,  Ireland,  and  Slovakia.  In  Finland  and  Slovakia,  appeals  are  pending.  In  Ireland,  the  appeals  court remanded the case to the lower court for rehearing.\n- BMS obtained initial positive decisions in the Czech Republic, France, and Netherlands, and appeals are pending in all three countries.\n- In  Spain,  the  Barcelona  Commercial  Court  found  the  composition-of-matter  patent  for Eliquis and  its  associated  SPC  invalid.  BMS  appealed,  and  the Barcelona Court of Appeal overturned the decision. The generic products that launched at risk after the Barcelona Commercial Court were either enjoined or removed from the market as a result of the Barcelona Court of Appeal ruling. An appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.\n- In  Finland,  generics  have  entered  the  market  while  proceedings  are  pending.  In  Portugal,  BMS  obtained  preliminary  injunctions  against  two  generic companies, but one generic company remains on the market while proceedings are pending.\n\nGeneric manufacturers may seek to market generic versions of Eliquis in additional countries in Europe prior to the expiration of our patents, which may lead to additional infringement and invalidity actions involving Eliquis patents being filed in various countries in Europe.\n\n## Plavix* - Australia\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, BMS and Sanofi were involved in patent litigation with a generic company seeking to launch clopidogrel bisulfate 75 mg tablets in Australia. While BMS and Sanofi obtained an initially favorable decision and an injunction, that decision was overturned on appeal. In 2013, the Australian government intervened seeking damages, which would have been split between BMS and Sanofi, for alleged losses experienced for paying a higher price for branded Plavix* during the period when the injunction was in place. BMS and Sanofi disputed that the Australian government is entitled to any damages. The trial court issued a decision dismissing the Australian government's claim for damages, the Australian government appealed, and the Federal Court issued a ruling in BMS and Sanofi's favor, which was affirmed in December 2024, by the High Court of Australia.\n\n## Pomalyst - U.S.\n\nIn  December  2024,  Celgene  received  a  Notice  Letter  from  Cipla  USA,  Inc.  ('Cipla')  notifying  Celgene  that  Cipla  had  filed  an ANDA  containing  paragraph  IV certifications seeking approval to market generic pomalidomide products in the U.S. In response, Celgene initiated a patent infringement action against Cipla in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, asserting certain FDA Orange Book-listed patents.

          "chunk_text": "An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovator's NDA is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the generic product. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV  certification. The innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, ANDAs including Paragraph IV  certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these ANDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines can also receive several types of regulatory exclusivity. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, a generic manufacturer may file its ANDA after the fourth year  of  the  five-year  regulatory  ex clusivity  period.  Our  marketed  chemical  products  include Eliquis,  Revlimid,  Pomalyst,  Sprycel,  Zeposia,  Camzyos,  Sotyktu , Augtyro, Krazati, and Cobenfy .\n\n## Biologic products (includes CAR-T cell therapy products)\n\nQualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative  biological  product  was  first  approved  by  the  FDA.  Our  marketed  biologic  products  include Opdivo , Opdivo  Qvantig, Orencia, Yervoy,  Reblozyl, Opdualag, Breyanzi, Abecma and Abraxane.\n\nIn the U.S., medicines (chemically synthesized or biologically derived) may also receive an additional six months of market exclusivity (added to certain patent terms and regulatory exclusivities) if certain agreed-upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market ex clusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions may limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory ex clusivity.\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended for up to five years to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 15 years from the date of drug approval. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis. The EU provides an additional six months of exclusivity added to the extended patent term if certain pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized  procedure.'  This  procedure  is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA.\n\nAfter obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout  the  EU,  all  products  for  which  marketing  authorizations  have  been  filed  after  October  and  November  2005  are  subject  to  an  '8+2+1'  regulatory exclusivity regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with ex isting treatments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY expanded its oncology portfolio to include CRC, emphasizing the development of both monotherapy and combination approaches, including the use of Opdivo in combination with Yervoy. This strategic expansion likely contributed to the significant growth in Yervoy sales by 2024, where Yervoy revenues increased by 13% overall (from $2,238M in 2023 to $2,530M in 2024), with U.S. sales rising 16% and non-U.S. sales increasing by 8%. The expansion into CRC, along with the approval and promotion of the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen for CRC treatment, appears to have directly supported the improved performance of Yervoy in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "We are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (i) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types; (ii) hematology with opportunities to broaden our franchise and potentially sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma; (iii) immunology with priorities in relapsing multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, RA and inflammatory bowel disease; (iv)  cardiovascular  disease  and;  (v)  fibrotic  disease  with  priorities  in  lung  and  liver.  We  continue  to  advance  the  next  wave  of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business development activities. We have  expanded  our  oncology,  hematology  and  immunology  portfolios  with  several  near-term  assets  and  additional  external partnerships.  We  have  invested  in  our  oncology  portfolio  by  pursuing  both  monotherapy  and  combination  approaches  and advancing our next wave of early assets and to explore new collaboration opportunities across our therapeutic areas of focus. We remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of Opdivo in earlier lines of therapy,  expand  into  new  tumors,  accelerate  next  wave  oncology  mechanisms  and  develop  treatment  options  for  refractory oncology patients. We are further strengthening our IO portfolio with another opportunity of relatlimab in a fixed dose combination with  nivolumab  for  the  treatment  of  melanoma  and  expanded  opportunities  in  adjuvant  melanoma,  lung,  liver  and  CRC.  For hematology, we have opportunities to launch several new medicines in the near-term with additional pipeline opportunities in the longer term. There is a broad effort to continue to address the unmet medical need in multiple myeloma and we are working across multiple  modalities  and  mechanisms  of  action  such  as  cereblon  modulators  ('CELMoDs'),  T-cell  Engagers  and  CAR  T-cell therapies.\n\nBeyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunology, cardiovascular and neuroscience diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. We believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines.  For  immunology  with  deucravacitinib,  our  selective  TYK2,  there  is  opportunity  to  be  a  medicine  that  could  treat multiple immune-mediated diseases. The FDA has accepted our NDA for deucravacitinib for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and has set a PDUFA goal date of September 10, 2022. We are expanding our portfolio for cardiovascular disease with our alliance partnership with Janssen where we are advancing a next-generation antithrombotic medicine in milvexian. Additionally,  through  the  acquisition  of  MyoKardia,  we  have  added  mavacamten,  which  has  the  potential  to  be  a  first-in-class medicine to treat the underlying cause of obstructive HCM. The FDA has accepted the NDA for mavacamten for this indication and assigned a revised PDUFA goal date of April 28, 2022.\n\nOur commercial model has been successful with revenues from our key brands continuing to grow, which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. We continue to drive adoption of Opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class  clinical  profile  and  extensive  real  world  data  and  is  now  the  number  one  novel  oral  anticoagulant  in  total  prescriptions globally. Revlimid and Pomalyst have  not  only  transformed  the  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma,  but  as  we  gained  deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of Revlimid and Pomalyst ,  we  have leveraged that knowledge to intentionally design novel CELMoD agents, iberdomide and CC-92480, to improve upon these earlier treatments. We are able to leverage our leading capabilities  in  hematological  malignancies  and  our  robust  pipeline  to  provide  opportunities  for  long-term  growth  to  offset  the impact of future patent expires for Revlimid and Pomalyst . We are building on the continued success of our other key brands and remain strongly committed to Orencia and Sprycel .  We  are  also  optimistic  on  the  future  growth  and  near-term  opportunities  of Reblozyl , Inrebic , Zeposia , Onureg , Breyanzi and Abecma .  Through  our  operating  model  transformation,  our  commercial infrastructure is leveraged for potential growth.\n\nWe expect the growth in our in-line and new product portfolio will enable us to more than offset the expected decline in Revlimid, Abraxane and other products revenues due to their loss of market exclusivity through 2025.\n\nOur operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial, R&amp;D and manufacturing resources on key brands and markets, strengthening our R&amp;D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. The evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in  the  highest  priority  opportunities  within  our  portfolio. Through  our  Celgene  acquisition  restructuring  activities,  we  expect  to realize approximately $3.0 billion of synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance through 2022 and our integration efforts across  general  and  administrative,  manufacturing,  R&amp;D,  procurement  and  streamlining  the  Company's  pricing  and  information technology infrastructure.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of key brands, executing product launches,  investing  in  our  diverse  and  innovative  pipeline,  aided  by  strategic  business  development,  focusing  on  prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie, through its subsidiary Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited, was involved in litigation against Aurobindo Pharma Limited over alleged patent infringement related to the drug Vraylar (cariprazine). By 2024, AbbVie itself had filed new litigation against Aurobindo Pharma Limited, this time concerning the drug Ubrelvy (ubrogepant), indicating a continuation and expansion of AbbVie's intellectual property enforcement strategy. This evolution shows that AbbVie not only maintained its legal stance against generic competition but also broadened its focus to new drug formulations, suggesting a strategic shift or extension in protecting its market exclusivity across different therapeutic areas.",

This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.\n\nThe CODM regularly reviews net revenues, net earnings and significant segment expenses and uses net earnings as its principal measure of segment profit or l oss. Net earnings and significant segment expenses reviewed by CODM are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The CODM uses net earnings as its principal measure of segment profit or loss to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. The CODM does not use segment assets to make decisions regarding resources; therefore, the total asset disclosure has not been included.\n\n## 97 | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did Gilead's settlement strategy with Apotex Inc. in 2023 regarding Symtuza influence the licensing terms granted to Apotex in 2024 for Genvoya, particularly in terms of market entry timing and patent scope?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Gilead reached a settlement with Apotex Inc. regarding Symtuza, granting Apotex a non-exclusive license to market a generic version starting on an agreed future date or earlier under certain conditions. This settlement was part of a broader pattern of resolving patent disputes with generic manufacturers through licensing agreements. In 2024, Gilead again entered into a settlement with Apotex, this time concerning Genvoya, granting a non-exclusive license for Apotex's ANDA product covering patents on cobicistat on silicon dioxide and TAF, with market entry set to begin on August 6, 2032, or earlier under specific conditions. The earlier Symtuza settlement likely influenced the structure and terms of the Genvoya licensing agreement, reflecting a consistent legal and business strategy to manage patent challenges while controlling the timing of generic competition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Litigation Relating to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis\n\nIn August 2019, we filed petitions requesting inter partes review of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,044,509, 9,579,333, 9,937,191 and 10,335,423 (collectively, 'HHS Patents') by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ('PTAB'). The HHS Patents are assigned to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ('HHS') and purport to claim a process of protecting a primate host from infection by an immunodeficiency retrovirus by administering a combination of FTC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF') or tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF') prior to exposure of the host to the immunodeficiency retrovirus, a process commonly known as pre-exposure prophylaxis ('PrEP'). In November 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court of Delaware, alleging that the use of Truvada and Descovy for PrEP infringes the HHS Patents. In February 2020, PTAB declined to institute our petitions for inter partes review of the HHS Patents. In April 2020, we filed a lawsuit against the U.S. federal government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ('CFC'), alleging breach of three material transfer agreements ('MTAs') related to the research underlying the HHS Patents and two clinical trial agreements ('CTAs') by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention related to PrEP research. A trial for the bifurcated portion of the lawsuit in the CFC was held in June 2022, and in November 2022, the CFC determined that the government breached the MTAs. In January 2024, the CFC found the government liable for breach of both CTAs. In May 2023, the District Court held a trial regarding the government's patent infringement claims, and the jury rendered a full defense verdict in favor of G ilead, finding that the asserted claims of the HHS Patents are invalid and the HHS patents are not infringed. In March 2024, the District Court upheld the jury's verdict that the government's patents are invalid, denied the government's request for a new trial and then entered final judgment. In July 2024, the government filed a notice of appeal. In January 2025, we entered into a settlement agreement with the government to resolve these litigation matters relating to PrEP. The settlement includes the dismissal of both lawsuits, including the government's appeal of the jury verdict that its patents are invalid, as well as a license to the government's ex isting PrEP patents.\n\n## Litigation with Generic Manufacturers\n\nAs part of the approval process for some of our products, FDA granted us a New Chemical Entity ('NCE') exclusivity period during which other manufacturers' applications for approval of generic versions of our products will not be approved. G eneric manufacturers may challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted NCE exclusivity one year prior to the end of the NCE exclusivity period. Generic manufacturers have sought and may continue to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application ('ANDA'), the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. The sale of generic versions of our products prior to their patent expiration would have a significant negative effect on our revenues and results of operations. To seek approval for a generic version of a product having NCE status, a generic company may submit its ANDA to FDA four years after the branded product's approval.\n\nIn  October  2021,  we  received  a  letter  from  Lupin  Ltd.  ('Lupin')  indicating  that  it  has  submitted  an ANDA  to  FDA  requesting  permission  to  market  and manufacture a generic version of Symtuza, a product commercialized by Janssen Products L.P. and for which G ilead shares in revenues. In November 2021, we, along with Janssen Products, L.P. and Janssen Sciences Ireland Unlimited Company (together, 'Janssen'), filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin as co-plaintiffs in  the  U.S.  District  Court  of  Delaware.  In  September  2022,  we  received  a  letter  from Apotex   Inc.  and Apotex   Corp.  (together,  'Apotex ')  stating  that  they  have submitted an ANDA for a generic version of Symtuza. In October 2022, we, along with Janssen, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Apotex as co-plaintiffs in the U.S. District Court of Delaware. The cases against Lupin and Apotex were consolidated into a single trial scheduled for February 2025. In February 2025, we, along with Janssen, entered into a settlement agreement with Lupin and its manufacturer of cobicistat on silicon dioxide, MSN Laboratories Private Limited, MSN Life Sciences Private  Ltd., and  MSN  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (collectively, 'MSN'), to resolve the litigation and patent challenges associated with  Symtuza in the  U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Lupin and MSN were granted a non-exclusive license for Lupin's ANDA product in the U.S. to our patent, jointly owned with Janssen, relating to a use of Symtuza, beginning on an agreed-upon date in the future, or earlier in certain circumstances. The terms of the settlement agreement are confidential. In February 2025, we, along with Janssen, entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex to resolve the litigation and patent challenges associated with Symtuza in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Apotex was granted a non-exclusive license for Apotex's ANDA product in the U.S. to our patent, jointly owned with Janssen, relating to a use of Symtuza, beginning on an agreed-upon date in the future, or earlier in certain circumstances. The terms of the settlement agreement are confidential. Both settlement agreements with Lupin and Apotex have been filed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice as required by law.",

('Cipla'), indicating that they have submitted ANDAs to FDA requesting permission to market and manufacture generic versions of the adult dosage strength of Biktarvy. Lupin, Laurus, and Cipla have challenged the validity of four of the six  patents listed in the Orange Book as associated with Biktarvy. We filed a lawsuit against Lupin, Laurus and Cipla in May 2022 in the U.S. District Court of  Delaware  and  intend  to  enforce  and  defend  our  intellectual  property. Additionally,  in  November  2023,  we  received  a  letter  from  Cipla  indicating  that  it  has submitted an ANDA to FDA requesting permission to market and manufacture a generic version of the pediatric dosage strength of Biktarvy. Cipla challenged the validity of two of the patents listed in the Orange Book as associated with Biktarvy. We filed a separate lawsuit against Cipla in December 2023 in the U.S. District Court of Delaware. This lawsuit has been consolidated with the first lawsuit, with a single trial scheduled for October 2025. In October 2024, Cipla separately filed a petition at the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office ('USPTO') for Inter Partes Review (IPR) of one of the patents at issue in District Court litigation. We intend to defend this patent at the USPTO.\n\nIn June 2023, we received a letter from Apotex indicating that it has submitted an ANDA to FDA requesting permission to market and manufacture a generic version of  G envoya.  In  July  2023,  we  filed  a  patent  infringement  lawsuit  against Apotex   in  the  U.S.  District  Court  of  Delaware  and  to  enforce  and  defend  our intellectual property. This case was consolidated with the Symtuza matters discussed above, and a trial was scheduled for February 2025. In February 2025, we entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex and its manufacturer of cobicistat on silicon dioxide, MSN, to resolve the litigation and patent challenges associated with Genvoya in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Apotex and MSN were granted a non-exclusive license for Apotex's ANDA product in the U.S. to certain of our patents on cobicistat on silicon dioxide and TAF relating to G envoya beginning on August 6, 2032, or earlier in certain circumstances. The settlement agreement has been filed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice as required by law.\n\n## Antitrust and Consumer Protection\n\nWe, along with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ('BMS'), Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc. ('Johnson &amp; Johnson'), and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ('Teva') have been named as defendants in class action lawsuits filed in 2019 and 2020 related to various drugs used to treat HIV , including drugs used in combination antiretroviral therapy. Plaintiffs allege that we (and the other defendants) engaged in various conduct to restrain competition in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. The lawsuits, which have been consolidated, are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuits seek to bring claims on behalf of direct purchasers consisting largely of wholesalers and indirect or end-payor purchasers, including health insurers and individual patients. Plaintiffs seek damages, permanent injunctive relief and other relief. In the second half of 2021 and first half of 2022, several plaintiffs consisting of retail pharmacies, individual health plans and United Healthcare, filed separate lawsuits effectively opting out of the class action cases, asserting claims that are substantively the same as the classes. These cases have been coordinated with the class actions. In March 2023, the District Court granted our motion to hold separate trials as to (i) the allegations against us and Teva seeking monetary damages relating to Truvada and Atripla ('Phase I') and (ii) the allegations against us and, in part, Johnson &amp; Johnson, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief relating to Complera ('Phase II'). In May 2023, we settled claims with the direct purchaser class and the retailer opt-out plaintiffs for $525 million, which we paid in the second half of 2023. The settlement agreements are not an admission of liability or fault by us. In June 2023, the jury returned a complete verdict in G ilead's favor on the remaining plaintiffs' Phase I allegations. In November 2023, the court denied plaintiffs' motion to set aside the verdict, and in February 2024, the court entered final judgment on the Phase I verdict and certain summary judgment rulings. In September 2024, plaintiffs filed their opening appellate briefs challenging the Phase I verdict and those summary judgment rulings. We filed our responsive briefs in January 2025. The court has stayed Phase II pending the appeal of Phase I. While we intend to vigorously oppose the appeal and defend against the Phase II claims, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. If plaintiffs are successful in their appeal or Phase II claims, we could be required to pay monetary damages or could be subject to permanent injunctive relief in favor of plaintiffs.\n\nIn January 2022, we, along with BMS and Janssen Products, L.P., were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, by Aetna, Inc. on behalf of itself and its affiliates and subsidiaries that effectively opts the Aetna plaintiffs out of the above class actions. The allegations are substantively the same as those in the class actions. The Aetna plaintiffs seek damages, permanent injunctive relief and other relief. In March 2024, the court denied our motion for judgment on the pleadings to preclude Aetna from re-litigating claims that were dismissed at summary judgment in the above class action cases. We filed a writ petition appealing the denial of our motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the appellate court denied in May 2024. In April 2024, the court granted our motion to bifurcate the case to adjudicate the issue of preclusion before litigating the merits of the case. In July 2024, Aetna filed a request to voluntarily dismiss two of its claims with prejudice, which the court subsequently granted, leaving only the claims related to Truvada and Atripla. In September 2024, Aetna filed an amended complaint with respect to these claims. In October 2024, we filed a demurrer and motion to strike plaintiff's claims.",

      "question": "How did GILD's collaboration with Merck on Keytruda-based combination therapies in 2022 evolve into broader partnership terms in 2023, particularly in terms of cost-sharing, commercialization rights, and revenue thresholds?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GILD collaborated with Merck on Keytruda-based combination therapies for NSCLC and TNBC, with Merck paying ongoing royalties on Keytruda sales (6.5% through 2023). By 2023, this relationship expanded into a broader partnership where GILD and Merck shared global development and commercialization costs at 60% and 40%, respectively. GILD gained U.S. commercialization rights for long-acting oral products, while Merck led in the EU and rest of the world. Revenue-sharing terms included equal revenue splits until thresholds of $2.0 billion (oral) and $3.5 billion (injectable) were surpassed, after which GILD's share increased to 65%. This evolution reflects a strategic deepening of the partnership beyond clinical collaboration into joint commercialization and revenue-sharing with defined financial thresholds.",

      "question": "How did the expiration timeline of key patent rights in 2023 influence LLY's projected market exclusivity periods for major products in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, LLY highlighted that the loss of patent protection typically results in rapid revenue declines due to generic competition, especially in the U.S., and that delays in regulatory approval or market access can limit the ability to capitalize on exclusivity periods. The company also noted that in December 2023, a proposed U.S. framework could allow the federal government to exercise 'march-in rights' on drugs developed with federal funds, potentially undermining patent protection. In 2024, LLY disclosed that the market exclusivity for major products depends on a complex interaction between patent and regulatory protections, with specific expiry dates listed for each product. However, the uncertainty around patent litigation and the potential impact of regulatory changes from 2023 (like the proposed march-in rights) introduced risk into the predictability of those exclusivity timelines. This shows a direct causal chain where the earlier patent risk environment (2023) affects how LLY assesses and discloses its market exclusivity outlook (2024) through the lens of evolving regulatory and legal dynamics.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Beckman Coulter, a subsidiary of DHR, recorded a $547 million pretax contract settlement expense as part of a resolution with Quidel Corporation, which included fixed annual payments of approximately $75 million through 2029. By 2023, these ongoing payments were still in effect and were classified as a noncash financing activity of $576 million, with cash outflows related to servicing the obligation being recorded as financing activities. This indicates that the initial settlement had long-term financial implications for DHR, as the company continued to bear significant financial obligations to Quidel, with the extended payment structure affecting both its balance sheet and cash flow statements. The fact that the payments remained unchanged through 2023 highlights the enduring impact of the 2021 agreement on DHR\u2019s financial planning and liquidity management.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nassessed, would require a charge to future earnings. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in its U.S. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws.\n\nTax authorities in Denmark have issued tax assessments related to interest accrued by certain of the Company's subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2015. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company received a notice from the Danish tax authorities that included a significant reduction in the interest amounts imposed on the original tax assessments. Taking into account the revised interest amounts, the assessments total approximately DKK 2.1 billion including interest accrued to date (approximately $317 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2021). The Company's appeal of the tax assessments with the Danish National Tax Tribunal has been put on hold awaiting the final outcome of other preceding withholding tax cases that have been brought before the Danish High Court. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company intends on pursuing this matter through the Danish High Court should the appeal to the Danish National Tax Tribunal be unsuccessful. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could take many years, as a result of the payments the Company has previously made related to these assessments in order to mitigate further interest accruals, the Company does not expect the resolution of this matter will have a future material adverse impact to the Company's financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.\n\nManagement estimates that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations may be reduced by approximately $58 million within 12 months as a result of resolution of worldwide tax matters, payments of tax audit settlements and/or statute of limitations expirations. Future resolution of uncertain tax positions related to discontinued operations may result in additional charges or credits to earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (refer to Note 3).\n\nThe Company operates in various non-U.S. jurisdictions where income tax incentives and rulings have been granted for specific periods of time. In Switzerland, the Company has various tax rulings and tax holiday arrangements which reduce the overall effective tax rate of the Company. The tax holidays expire between 2022 and 2027. In Singapore, the Company operates under various tax incentive agreements that provide for reduced tax rates. Subject to the Company satisfying certain requirements, the agreements expire in 2022.  As of December 31, 2021, the Company had satisfied the conditions enumerated in these agreements. Included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are tax benefits of $59 million, $43 million and $71 million (or $0.08, $0.06 and $0.10 per diluted common share) for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from these rulings and tax holidays.\n\n## NOTE 8. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES\n\nEffective July 24, 2021, the Company's indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Beckman Coulter, Inc. ('Beckman'), entered into a series of related agreements with Quidel Corporation and a subsidiary thereof ('Quidel') to resolve litigation that Beckman initiated against Quidel and to modify and partially terminate the related prior commercial arrangement. Pursuant to the related agreements, the dispute regarding Beckman's ability to compete in B-type Naturietic Peptide ('BNP') test related activities has been settled, allowing Beckman to research, develop, manufacture and distribute BNP type tests. Beckman's commitment to supply certain BNP test kits to Quidel has also been terminated. Beckman also obtained the right to distribute and sell the BNP assay currently sold by Quidel. As consideration under the agreements, Beckman will pay Quidel predominantly fixed payments of approximately $75 million per year through 2029 (subject to proration in 2021). The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in determining the value of the elements of the transaction. The present value of the payments to Quidel is estimated to be $581 million, of which $547 million was recorded as a pretax contract settlement expense primarily due to the unfavorable nature of the prior arrangement (consisting of a cash charge of $5 million and a noncash charge of $542 million) in the third quarter of 2021 related to the modification and partial termination of the prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation. The Company also capitalized $34 million in intangible assets, comprised of proprietary technology, customer relationships and the use of a trade name acquired in the settlement, which represent a noncash investing activity. Due to the extended payment terms of the arrangement, the arrangement represents a noncash financing activity of $576 million. Over the period of the arrangement, the cash payments related to servicing the obligation due to Quidel will be recorded as cash outflows from financing activities and the payments related to the imputed interest on the obligation due to Quidel will be recorded as cash outflows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.",

      "question": "How did the introduction of the RADV Audit Rule in 2023 impact CVS's Medicare Advantage plan performance and risk adjustment payments compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS offered expanding Medicare Advantage plans and was subject to CMS audits and risk adjustment mechanisms, which directly influenced its reimbursement and plan performance. In January 2023, CMS introduced the RADV Audit Rule, which eliminated the fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster and continued the use of extrapolation in contract-level RADV audits. This change increased the potential liability for payment errors without the buffer of the FFS adjuster, directly affecting risk adjustment data validation and reimbursement accuracy for Medicare Advantage plans. As a result, the Company faced greater uncertainty and potential adverse financial impacts on its Medicare operating results. In 2023, CMS released the Company's star ratings, which showed that its Medicare Advantage plans were not eligible for full-level quality bonuses in 2024, potentially reducing profit margins. However, based on the 2024 star ratings released in October 2023, the percentage of Aetna Medicare Advantage members in 4+ star plans was expected to return to 87%, up from 21% based on the 2023 ratings, indicating a potential recovery in plan performance and eligibility for full-level quality bonuses in 2025.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVS(2022) \u2192 Medicare Advantage Plans: In 2022, CVS offered expanding Medicare Advantage plans as part of its Health Care Benefits segment, which was subject to CMS audits and risk adjustment mechanisms.",
        "Hop 2: Medicare Advantage Plans \u2192 RADV Audit Rule: In 2023, the RADV Audit Rule introduced by CMS eliminated the FFS adjuster and continued extrapolation in audits, increasing the risk of repayment liabilities for Medicare Advantage organizations like CVS.",
        "Hop 3: RADV Audit Rule \u2190 CVS(2023): In 2023, the Company's Medicare Advantage plans were not eligible for full-level quality bonuses in 2024, but the 2024 star ratings indicated a recovery, with 87% of Aetna Medicare Advantage members expected to be in 4+ star plans, impacting future risk adjustment payments."

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "question": "How did the legal risks associated with Comirnaty in 2024 relate to Pfizer's ongoing contractual manufacturing obligations from 2023, particularly in light of the Comirnaty formulation updates approved in late 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Pfizer had $33 million in Comirnaty-related manufacturing revenues from its partnership with BioNTech and carried $6 billion in remaining performance obligations tied to Comirnaty and Paxlovid supply contracts, with deliveries expected through 2028. In September 2023, the FDA approved an updated Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted version of Comirnaty, which likely contributed to ongoing manufacturing and supply commitments. However, by 2024, Comirnaty became the subject of multiple lawsuits from GSK and Promosome, alleging patent infringement in both the U.S. and Europe. These legal actions introduced new risk factors for Pfizer related to Comirnaty\u2019s continued production and commercialization, directly impacting the company\u2019s ability to fulfill long-term obligations tied to the product. Thus, the legal risks in 2024 directly challenged the fulfillment of the contractual commitments made in 2023, especially as the updated formulation increased production complexity and potential exposure to litigation.",

        "Hop 3: Comirnaty \u2190 PFE(2024): By 2024, Comirnaty faced multiple patent infringement lawsuits from GSK and Promosome in the U.S. and Europe, introducing legal risks that could disrupt Pfizer\u2019s ability to fulfill the Comirnaty supply obligations carried over from 2023."

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS maintained a 50% ownership stake in Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity jointly established with Cardinal Health, Inc. in 2014 and extended in 2021 for a total term of 15 years, running through 2029. Cardinal made quarterly payments to CVS, which began in October 2014 and were scheduled to continue through June 2029, with increases tied to milestone achievements. These payments reduced CVS's carrying value of inventory and were recognized in cost of products sold when inventory was sold. By 2024, CVS continued to consolidate Red Oak as the primary beneficiary, indicating that its strategic role remained intact and that the sourcing arrangement was still central to both companies' supply chain operations. The extension of the Red Oak agreement in 2021, as noted in both 2022 and 2024 disclosures, demonstrates a continued commitment to the joint venture, suggesting that the relationship with Cardinal Health, Inc. remained a key component of CVS\u2019s sourcing strategy and cost management in generic pharmaceuticals.",

          "chunk_text": "## Shares Held in Trust\n\nThe Company maintains grantor trusts, which held approximately one million shares of its common stock at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. These shares are designated for use under various employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nThe Company has investments in (i) a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity, (ii) certain hedge fund and private equity investments and (iii) certain real estate partnerships that are considered VIEs. The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it may voluntarily contribute funds. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers several factors, including whether the Company has (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities - Primary Beneficiary\n\nIn 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ('Cardinal') established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ('Red Oak'), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own 50%. The Red Oak arrangement had an initial term of ten years. In 2021, the Red Oak arrangement was amended to extend the initial term an additional five years, for a total term of 15 years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak by either company, and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\nCardinal is required to pay the Company quarterly payments, which began in October 2014 and will extend through June 2029. As milestones are met, the quarterly payments increase. The Company received $183 million from Cardinal during each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The payments reduce the Company's carrying value of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold. Amounts reimbursed by Cardinal for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and amounts due to or due from Cardinal at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities - Other Variable Interest Holder\n\nThe Company has invested in certain VIEs for which it has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary, consisting of the following:\n\n- Hedge fund and private equity investments - The Company invests in hedge fund and private equity investments in order to generate investment returns for its investment portfolio supporting its insurance businesses.\n- Real estate partnerships - The Company invests in various real estate partnerships, including those that construct, own and manage low-income housing developments. For the low income housing development investments, substantially all of the projected benefits to the Company are from tax credits and other tax benefits.\n\nThe Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because the nature of the Company's involvement with the activities of these VIEs does not give the Company the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. The Company records the amount of its investment in these VIEs as long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes its share of each VIE's income or losses in net income (loss). The Company's maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is limited to its investment balances as disclosed below and the risk of recapture of previously recognized tax credits related to the real estate partnerships, which the Company does not consider significant.\n\nThe total amount of other variable interest holder VIE assets included in long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\n\n",

Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak. Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company.\n\n## Working Capital Practices\n\nThe Company funds the growth of its businesses through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and long-term borrowings. For additional information on the Company's working capital practices, see 'Liquidity and Capital Resources' in the MD&amp;A included in Item 7 of this 10-K. Employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, providers, governmental units, government-sponsored plans (with the exception of Medicare Part D services, which are described below), labor groups and expatriates, which represent the vast majority of Health Care Benefits segment revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. As a provider of Medicare Part D services, the Company contracts annually with CMS. Utilization of services each plan year results in the accumulation of either a receivable from or a payable to CMS. The timing of settlement of the receivable or payable with CMS takes several quarters, which impacts working capital from year to year. The majority of the Retail/LTC segment non-pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards. Managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, government funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third party insurance programs, which represent the vast majority of the Company's consolidated pharmacy revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. The remainder of the Company's consolidated pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards.\n\n## Human Capital\n\n## Overview\n\nAt CVS Health, we share a single, clear purpose: bringing our heart to every moment of your health. We devote significant time and attention to the attraction, development and retention of talent to deliver high levels of service to our customers. Our commitment to them includes a competitive rewards package and programs that support our diverse range of colleagues in rewarding and fulfilling careers. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 300,000 colleagues primarily in the United States including in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, approximately 72% of whom were full-time.\n\nWe believe engaged colleagues produce stronger business results and are more likely to build a career with the Company. Each year we conduct an internal engagement survey that provides colleagues with an opportunity to share their opinions and experiences with respect to their role, their team and the enterprise to help our Board and our management identify areas where we can improve colleague experience. The survey covers a broad range of topics including development and opportunities, diversity management, recognition, performance, well-being, compliance and continuous improvement. In 2021, greater than 80% of our colleagues participated in the engagement survey, of which greater than 75% responded that they were actively engaged.\n\nThe Board and our chief executive officer ('CEO') provide oversight of our human capital strategy, which consists of the following categories: total rewards; diversity, equity and inclusion; colleague development; and health and safety.\n\n## Total Rewards\n\nWe recognize how vital our colleagues are to our success and strive to offer comprehensive and competitive wages and benefits to meet the varying needs of our colleagues and their families. The benefits and programs include annual bonuses, 401(k) plans, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, health care and insurance benefits, paid time off, flexible work schedules, family leave, dependent care resources, colleague assistance programs and tuition assistance, among many others, depending on eligibility.\n\nIn recognition of the critical role that the attraction and retention of talent plays in the success of our business, during 2021, we also announced a significant investment in our employees through an increase in the Company's minimum hourly wage to $15.00 an hour effective July 2022, with incremental increases to the Company's competitive hourly rates beginning in August 2021. The new wage structure also incorporates additional increases beyond the $15.00 minimum, with higher starting hourly rates for roles such as pharmacy technicians and call center representatives. In addition, during 2021 we awarded incremental",

The effect of a change in the tax  rates on deferred tax  assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such change.\n\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and the Company's recent operating results. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax  asset will be recovered.\n\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax  positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\n\nInterest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax  positions are recognized in the income tax  provision.\n\n## Measurement of Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans ('pension plans') and other postretirement employee benefit plans ('OPEB plans') for its employees and retirees. The Company recognizes the funded status of its pension and OPEB plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on the year-end measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations. When the fair value of plan assets are in ex cess of the plan benefit obligations, the amounts are reported in other current assets and other assets. When the fair value of plan benefit obligations are in ex cess of plan assets, the amounts are reported in accrued ex penses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities based on the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets. The net periodic benefit income for the Company's pension and OPEB plans do not contain a service cost component as these plans have been frozen for an extended period of time. Non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nEarnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method. The Company calculates basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. See Note 16 ''Earnings Per Share'' for additional information.\n\n## Shares Held in Trust\n\nThe Company maintains grantor trusts, which held approximately one million shares of its common stock at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. These shares are designated for use under various employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## VIEs\n\nThe Company has various investments that are considered VIEs. The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it may voluntarily contribute funds. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers several factors, including whether the Company has (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the V IE.\n\n## VIEs - Primary Beneficiary\n\n## Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ('Red Oak')\n\nIn 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc.

      "question": "How did Merck's 2023 collaboration revenue from Keytruda-related partnerships evolve into concerns about U.S. sales declines in 2024 due to government price setting under the Inflation Reduction Act?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Merck reported $212 million in alliance revenue from collaborations, including co-promotion and royalty arrangements for products like Reblozyl, which reflects the company's broader strategy of leveraging partnerships to drive revenue. This collaborative model extended to Keytruda, a major revenue driver, which was being evaluated in combination with other therapies like V940 (mRNA-4157) under a joint development agreement with Moderna. However, by 2024, Merck explicitly stated that Keytruda would be subject to government price setting under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with a government-determined price expected to take effect on January 1, 2028. This regulatory shift, which followed the precedent of Januvia's price negotiation in 2023 and Janumet's in 2025, is projected to cause a decline in U.S. sales of Keytruda after 2028. The evolution from collaborative revenue growth in 2023 to anticipated regulatory-driven sales pressure in 2024 highlights how Merck\u2019s strategic positioning around Keytruda has been increasingly constrained by public policy changes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn  addressing global cost containment pressures, the  Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens' access to appropriate health care, including medicines.\n\nOperating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company's business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.\n\n## United States\n\nThe Company faces increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company's sales and profit margins, including, through (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to M edicare and M edicaid, including the M edicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization A ct of 2003, the Patient Protection and A ffordable Care A ct of 2010 (A CA ), the A merican Rescue Plan A ct of 2021 (A merican Rescue Plan A ct), and the Inflation Reduction A ct of 2022 (IRA ). A dditionally , increased utiliz ation of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program and restrictions on the Company's ability to identify  inappropriate discounts are having a negative impact on Company performance.\n\nIn the U.S., federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay . For example, federal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by M edicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain state and federal entities such as the Department of Defense, V eterans A ffairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.\n\nAdditionally in the U.S., consolidation and integration among health care entities is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products.  Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for M erck's products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been increasing the cost-sharing required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies, as well as governments, also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in  treatment  areas  in  which  the  payor  has  taken  the  position  that  multiple  branded  products  are  therapeutically  comparable.  A s  the  U.S.  payor  market concentrates further, the Company may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors.\n\n## Legislative Changes\n\nIn 2022, Congress passed the IRA , which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the M edicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the M edicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits, which has taken effect in 2025, and government price setting for certain M edicare Part D drugs, starting in 2026, and  M edicare  Part  B  drugs  starting  in  2028.  Government  price  setting  may  also  impact  pricing  in  the  private  market  negatively  affecting  the  Company's performance. In A ugust 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for M edicare &amp; M edicaid Services (CM S), selected Januvia for the first y ear of the IRA 's 'Drug Price Negotiation Program' (Program). Pursuant to the IRA 's Program, a government price was set for Januvia , which will become effective on January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS announced that Janumet and Janumet XR have been selected for government price setting, which will become effective on January 1, 2027. In addition, the Company expects that Keytruda will be selected in 2026 for government price setting, which would become effective on January 1, 2028 and the Company expects that, as a result, U.S. sales of Keytruda will decline after that time. The Company has sued the U.S.  government  regarding  the  IRA 's  Program  (see  Item  8  'Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,'  Note  10.  'Contingencies  and  Environmental Liabilities' below). Furthermore,",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Relating to G overnment Regulation and Legal Proceedings\n\n## The health care industry in the U.S. has been, and will continue to be, subject to increasing regulation and political action.\n\nAs discussed above in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment,' the Company believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as well as political and legal action, as future proposals to reform the health care system are considered by the Executive Branch, Congress and state legislatures.\n\nIn 2022, Congress passed the IRA , which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the M edicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the M edicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits, which has taken effect in 2025, and government price setting for certain M edicare Part D drugs, starting in 2026, and  M edicare  Part  B  drugs  starting  in  2028.  Furthermore,  government  price  setting  may  also  impact  pricing  in  the  private  market,  negatively  affecting  the Company's performance. A s noted in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment,' in 2023, HHS selected Januvia for the first y ear of the IRA 's price setting program, which will result in a government set price becoming effective on January 1, 2026. On January 17, 2025, HHS announced that Janumet and Janumet XR have been selected for government price setting, which will become effective on January 1, 2027. Furthermore, the Company expects that in 2026 HHS will include Keytruda in a subsequent selection of products to undergo IRA  price setting, with such price to become effective on January 1, 2028 and the Company expects that, as a result, U.S. sales of Keytruda will decline after that time.\n\nIn addition, in 2021, Congress passed the A merican Rescue Plan A ct, which included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to M edicaid beginning in January 2024. These rebates act as a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer discounts paid to M edicaid can increase. Prior to this change, manufacturers have not been required to pay more than 100% of the A verage M anufacturer Price (AMP) in rebates to state M edicaid programs for M edicaid-covered drugs. A s a result of this provision, manufacturers may have to pay state M edicaid programs more in rebates than they received on sales of particular products. This change presents a risk to M erck for drugs that have high M edicaid utilization and rebate exposure that is more than 100% of the AM P . A dditionally , increased utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program and restrictions on the Company's ability  to identify  inappropriate discounts are having a negative impact on the Company's performance. A lso, the Company expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical pricing and will increasingly shift to more aggressive price control tools such as Prescription Drug A ffordability Boards that have the authority to conduct affordability rev iews and establish upper payment limits and that Company products may be selected for such reviews.\n\nIn the U.S., members of the government have made public statements in favor of, and may take steps to implement, various regulatory changes that could  negatively  impact  the  pharmaceutical  industry ,  including  the  Company .  Those  potential  changes  include  some  related  to  vaccines  and  vaccine development, as well as personnel and policy changes at the FDA and other government agencies and programs. For example, HHS could undergo changes that could make it more difficult for the FDA  to grant regulatory approvals for drugs and vaccines and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue or maintain recommendations for vaccines. A dditionally , if the FDA  drug user fee programs were eliminated, that could cause significant delays to facility inspections and approvals of new products. It is too early for the Company to assess which, if any , of the policy changes that have been publicly referenced would be implemented, and the Company cannot predict what additional future changes in the health care industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in particular,  will  occur;  howev er,  any   changes  could  hav e  a  material  adv erse  effect  on  the  Company 's  business,  cash  flows,  results  of  operations,  financial condition and prospects.\n\n## The  Company's  products,  including  products  in  development,  cannot  be  marketed  unless  the  Company  obtains  and  maintains  regulatory approval.\n\nThe Company's activities, including research, preclinical testing, clinical trials and the manufacturing and marketing of its products, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in the U.S., including the FDA , and by foreign regulatory authorities, including in the EU, Japan and China. In the U.S., the FDA  administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety , effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals and vaccines. In some cases, the FDA  requirements have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the U.S. Regulation outside the U.S. also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, reduction in the cost of drugs. The FDA  and foreign regulatory authorities, including in the EU, Japan and China, have substantial discretion to require additional testing, to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Gilead identified that changes in tax laws and broader regulatory uncertainty, including evolving interpretations of programs like the 340B Drug Pricing Program, could materially impact their financial position. These regulatory shifts included enforcement actions and policy interpretations by the HHS Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which challenged certain manufacturers\u2019 contract pharmacy policies, signaling increased scrutiny of the program. In response, Gilead implemented a contract pharmacy integrity initiative in March 2022 for their branded HCV products, requiring 340B-covered entities to provide claims-level data or designate a single contract pharmacy. By 2024, this initiative faced legal and legislative uncertainty, as some states enacted laws requiring manufacturers to provide 340B pricing through contract pharmacies, conflicting with Gilead\u2019s policy. These developments constrained Gilead\u2019s pricing flexibility and increased rebate obligations, as the expansion of the 340B Program limited the prices Gilead could charge on a growing portion of sales. Additionally, potential enforcement actions or litigation stemming from the 2023 regulatory environment could further impact Gilead\u2019s ability to maintain or modify their 340B-related policies, directly affecting their financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "- Many state legislatures are considering, or have already passed into law, legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as requiring manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, creating review boards for prices, establishing drug payment limits, and encouraging the use of generic drugs. For example, in August 2023, the Colorado Prescription Drug Affordability Review Board ('PDAB') selected G envoya for an affordability review , and subsequently determined that G envoya was not unaffordable. Additional state PDABs have or may in the future undertake similar affordability reviews of our products. A finding that one of our products is unaffordable could lead to legislative action to designate an upper limit on the amount certain purchasers and payors can pay for our products. These initiatives and such other legislation may cause added pricing pressures on our products, and the resulting impact on our business is uncertain at this time.\n- Many countries outside the U.S., including the EU member states, have established complex and lengthy procedures to obtain price approvals and coverage reimbursement and periodically review their pricing and reimbursement decisions. The outcome of these reviews cannot be predicted and could have an adverse effect on the pricing and reimbursement of our medical products in the EU member states. Reductions in the pricing of our medical products in one member state could affect the price in other member states and have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\nA substantial portion of our product sales is subject to significant discounts from list price, including rebates that we may be required to pay state Medicaid agencies and discounts provided to covered entities under 340B. Changes to the 340B program or the Medicaid program at the federal or state level could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, the continued growth of the 340B program limits the prices we may charge on an increasing percentage of sales. Changes to the calculation of rebates under the Medicaid program could substantially increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and decrease the prices we charge 340B-covered entities.\n\nIn March 2022, we implemented a contract pharmacy integrity initiative for our branded hepatitis C virus ('HCV ') products. This integrity initiative does not involve any products from Asegua Therapeutics LLC. Our integrity initiative requires covered entities that enter into 340B bill to/ship to arrangements with contract pharmacies for our branded HCV products to provide claims level data for units dispensed from such contract pharmacies; covered entities without an in-house pharmacy that choose not to participate in the initiative can designate a single contract pharmacy for shipment. Certain manufacturers that have implemented other contract pharmacy integrity programs have received enforcement letters from the  U.S.  Department of  Health and  Human  Services ('HHS') asserting that those programs violate the 340B statute, have been referred to the HHS Office of Inspector G eneral for assessment of civil monetary penalties, and have been subject to administrative dispute resolution proceedings brought on behalf of covered entities. Some of these manufacturers are challenging HHS' position in litigation. Certain states have also enacted laws requiring manufacturers to provide 340B pricing through contract pharmacy arrangements, and additional states may adopt similar laws; we believe these laws, which are being challenged in ongoing litigation, are invalid but we have carved out covered entities in certain states from our integrity initiative while litigation challenging these laws proceeds. We also believe that our integrity initiative complies with the requirements of the 340B statute. However, additional legal or legislative developments with respect to the 340B program, including potential litigation with HHS or other stakeholders, may negatively impact our ability to implement or continue our integrity initiative.\n\nIn addition, standard reimbursement structures do not always adequately reimburse for innovative therapies. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2021, CMS established  a  new  severity-adjusted  diagnosis-related  group  ('DRG ')  018  for  Medicare  inpatient  reimbursement  of  CAR  T-cell  products  such  as  Y escarta  and Tecartus. While the new DRG has a significantly higher base payment amount than the prior DRG  016, the payment available may not be sufficient to reimburse some hospitals for their cost of care for patients receiving  Y escarta and  Tecartus.  When reimbursement is not aligned well to account for treatment costs,  Medicare beneficiaries may be denied access as this misalignment could impact the willingness of some hospitals to offer the therapy and of doctors to recommend the therapy. Additionally, in the EU, there are barriers to reimbursement in individual countries that could limit the uptake of Y escarta and Tecartus.\n\nMoreover, we estimate the rebates we will be required to pay in connection with sales during a particular quarter based on claims data from prior quarters. In the U.S., actual rebate claims are typically made by payers one to three quarters in arrears. Actual claims and payments may vary significantly from our estimates.",

      "question": "How did BMY's investment in 2seventy bio in 2022 influence the profit-sharing dynamics for Anti-BCMA Products like Abecma in 2024, particularly given the changes in manufacturing obligations and ex-U.S. milestone payments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY had a 50/50 co-development and profit-sharing arrangement with 2seventy bio for Anti-BCMA Products like Abecma in the U.S., while BMY retained exclusive rights for development and commercialization outside the U.S. By 2024, the collaboration terms were amended to transfer substantially all manufacturing obligations to BMY and eliminate ex-U.S. milestones and royalties payable to 2seventy bio. This shift likely reduced BMY's long-term financial obligations to 2seventy bio, even as Abecma\u2019s U.S. sales grew from $297 million in 2022 to $242 million in 2024 (with profit-sharing costs rising from $49 million to $43 million). These changes reflect a strategic recalibration of responsibilities and financial exposure in the partnership, directly influenced by BMY\u2019s initial investment and evolving stake in 2seventy bio.",

Ono is entitled to receive royalties of 4% in North America and 15% in all territories excluding the three countries listed above, subject to customary adjustments.\n\n## Nektar\n\nIn  2018,  BMS  and  Nektar  commenced  a  worldwide  license  and  collaboration  for  the  development  and  commercialization  of Bempegaldesleukin  (NKTR-214),  Nektar's  investigational  immuno-stimulatory  therapy  designed  to  selectively  expand  specific cancer-fighting T cells and natural killer cells directly in the tumor micro-environment. In January 2020, the parties amended the collaboration agreement. The Opdivo and NKTR-214 combination therapy is currently in Phase III clinical studies for metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and RCC. A joint development plan agreed by the parties as part of the original agreement, and updated as part of the January 2020 amendment, specifies development in certain indications and tumor types  with  each  party  responsible  for  the  supply  of  their  own  product.  BMS's  share  of  the  development  costs  associated  with therapies comprising a BMS medicine used in combination with NKTR-214 is 67.5%, subject to certain cost caps for Nektar. The January  2020  amendment  retains  the  cost  sharing  percentages  from  the  original  agreement.  The  parties  will  also  jointly commercialize  the  therapies,  subject  to  regulatory  approval.  BMS's  share  of  global  NKTR-214  profits  and  losses  will  be  35% subject to certain annual loss caps for Nektar.\n\nBMS paid Nektar $1.85 billion for the rights discussed above and 8.3 million shares of Nektar common stock which represented a 4.8% ownership interest.  BMS's equity  ownership  is  subject  to  certain  lock-up,  standstill  and  voting  provisions  for  a  five-year period. The amount of the up-front payment allocated to the equity investment was $800 million after considering Nektar's stock price on the date of closing and current limitations on trading the securities. The remaining $1.05 billion of the up-front payment was allocated to the rights discussed above. BMS will also pay up to $1.8 billion upon the achievement of contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones over the life of the alliance period. Research and development cost reimbursements were $98 million in 2021, $132 million in 2020 and $108 million in 2019.\n\n## 2seventy bio (formerly bluebird)\n\nOn November 4, 2021, bluebird completed the tax-free spin-off of its oncology programs and portfolio into 2seventy bio, Inc., an independent, publicly-traded company.\n\nThe  parties  jointly  develop  and  commercialize  novel  disease-altering  gene  therapy  product  candidates  targeting  BCMA.  The collaboration arrangement began in 2013 and included (i) a right for BMS to license any anti-BCMA products resulting from the collaboration,  (ii)  a  right  for  2seventy  bio  to  participate  in  the  development  and  commercialization  of  any  licensed  products resulting  from  the  collaboration  through  a  50/50  co-development  and  profit  share  in  the  U.S.  in  exchange  for  a  reduction  of milestone  payments,  and  (iii)  sales-based  milestones  and  royalties  payable  to  2seventy  bio  upon  the  commercialization  of  any licensed  products  resulting  from  the  collaboration  if  2seventy  bio  declined  to  exercise  their  co-development  and  profit  sharing rights. The options to license idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121) and bb21217 were exercised in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2022, the parties elected to not pursue further development of bb21217.\n\nAll profits and losses relating to developing, commercializing and manufacturing ide-cel within the U.S. are shared equally. BMS is exclusively responsible for the development and commercialization of ide-cel outside the U.S.\n\nIn  2020,  terms  of  the  collaboration  were  amended  including  certain  manufacturing  obligations.  Both  parties  were  also  released from future exclusivity related to BCMA-directed T cell therapies. BMS paid $200 million to extinguish its obligation for future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on ide-cel, which was included in Research and development expense in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the FDA approved ide-cel (' Abecma ' ) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Net product sales of Abecma  within  the  Alliance  territory  were  $158  million  and  related  profit  sharing  costs  were  $42  million  in  2021.  Cost reimbursements were not material.",

All rights and obligations for MORAb-202 were transferred to Eisai, and BMS is to receive $90 million as part of the termination, which was included in Other (income)/expense, net during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, of which $85 million was received during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n## Note 4. ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, LICENSING AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS\n\n## Asset Acquisition\n\n## Karuna\n\nOn March 18, 2024, BMS acquired Karuna, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company driven to discover, develop, and deliver transformative medicines for people living  with  psychiatric  and  neurological  conditions.  The  acquisition  provided  BMS  with  rights  to Cobenfy (x anomeline  and  trospium  chloride),  formerly  KarXT. Cobenfy is an antipsychotic with a novel mechanism of action and differentiated efficacy and safety, which was approved by the FDA on September 26, 2024 for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Cobenfy is also in registrational trials for both adjunctive therapy to ex isting standard of care agents in schizophrenia and the treatment of psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nBMS acquired  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  Karuna's  common  stock  for  $330.00  per  share  in  an  all-cash  transaction  for  total  consideration  of $14.0 billion, or $12.9 billion net of cash acquired. The acquisition was funded primarily with debt proceeds (see \"-Note 10. Financing Arrangements\" for further detail). The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since Cobenfy represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired. As a result, $12.1 billion was ex pensed to Acquired IPRD during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.\n\nThe following summarizes the total consideration transferred and allocation of consideration transferred to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and Acquired IPRD expense:",

The  acquisition  provided  BMS  with  rights  to Cobenfy (x anomeline  and  trospium  chloride),  formerly  KarXT. Cobenfy is an antipsychotic with a novel mechanism of action and differentiated efficacy and safety, which was approved by the FDA on September 26, 2024 for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Cobenfy is also in registrational trials for both adjunctive therapy to ex isting standard of care agents in schizophrenia and the treatment of psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nBMS acquired  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  Karuna's  common  stock  for  $330.00  per  share  in  an  all-cash  transaction  for  total  consideration  of $14.0 billion, or $12.9 billion net of cash acquired. The acquisition was funded primarily with debt proceeds (see \"-Note 10. Financing Arrangements\" for further detail). The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since Cobenfy represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired. As a result, $12.1 billion was ex pensed to Acquired IPRD during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.\n\nThe following summarizes the total consideration transferred and allocation of consideration transferred to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and Acquired IPRD expense:",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen faced intensified cost reduction pressures from U.S. payers, including stricter formulary positioning, higher patient co-pays, and payer consolidation, which limited product usage and sales\u2014particularly for ENBREL, Otezla, Repatha, and Aimovig. By 2024, Amgen shifted toward strategic partnerships with payers, especially in response to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Medicare Part D redesign that capped beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and increased manufacturer discount obligations starting in 2025. This evolution reflects a move from reactive rebate management to proactive collaboration with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes, as evidenced by Amgen's stated commitment to work with the healthcare community to ensure innovation and patient access. The shift was also influenced by the IRA\u2019s requirement for rebates if drug prices outpaced inflation, which Amgen began accruing for in 2022 for Part D and 2023 for Part B, indicating a forward-looking alignment with payer and regulatory expectations.",

          "chunk_text": "In the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and PBMs are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and PBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program.\n\nBoth private and some government payers use formularies to manage access to and utilization of drugs. A drug's inclusion and favorable positioning on a formulary are essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients' use of commercial  manufacturer  co-pay  payment  assistance  programs  (including  through  co-pay  accumulator  adjustment  or  maximization programs),  stricter  utilization  management  criteria  before  a  patient  may  get  access  to  a  drug,  higher-tier  formulary  placement  that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has  thereby  limited  Amgen  product  usage  and  sales.  Furthermore,  during  the  past  few  years,  many  PBMs  and  insurers  have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As  a  result,  PBMs  and  insurers  have  greater  market  power  and  negotiating  leverage  to  mandate  stricter  utilization  criteria  and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such  as  the  markets  for  ENBREL,  Otezla,  Repatha  and  Aimovig,  PBMs  are  also  able  to  exert  negotiating  leverage  by  requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position.\n\nIn addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers in both of the major U.S. political  parties  are  pursuing  policies  to  lower  drug  costs.  Potential  policies  cover  a  wide  range  of  areas,  including  allowing  the importation of drugs from other countries; instituting IRP schemes, which would set the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries; implementing policies that in effect would require manufacturers to accept government-set prices for certain drugs, with price ceilings based on a domestic reference-pricing scheme; redesigning the Medicare Part D benefit so as to establish a cap on patient out-of-pocket costs, paired with new requirements that manufacturers cover a share of the costs of Part D drugs; stipulating penalties  if  drug  price  benchmarks  rise  faster  than  inflation;  increasing  transparency  in  drug  pricing;  and  using  third-party  value assessments  to  determine  drug  prices.  Examples  of  such  policies  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  previous  Administration's November 2020 interim final rule, which attempts to institute an MFN IRP model in Medicare Part B and a final rule instituting rebate reform  in  Medicare  Part  D.  Both  of  the  resulting  rules  are  being  challenged  in  court  and  have  not  yet  been  implemented.  Further, although CMS withdrew the MFN IRP, policy makers continue to express strong interest in policies to address drug pricing. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability . The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law on November 15, 2021, delays implementation of the rebate reform rule until 2026 and requires manufacturers of certain  Part  B-covered  drugs  packaged  in  single-use  containers  to  give  refunds  to  the  government  starting  in  2023  for  discarded amounts.  Although  the  direction  of  drug-pricing-policy  reforms  remains  unclear  at  this  time,  Congress  is  continuing  to  consider prescription-drug-pricing reforms, including legislative proposals for a number of the concepts discussed above (including a full repeal of the prior Administration's Part D rebate reform rule).\n\nIn many countries other than the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are  expanding  in  both  established  and  emerging  markets.  Many  countries  also  limit  coverage  to  populations  narrower  than  those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The EU is currently undergoing a review and possible revision of its pharmaceutical legislation, scheduled to conclude at the end 2022. There is a risk that this review will lead to  proposals that may reduce intellectual property protection for new products, as well as change the reimbursement and regulatory landscape in ways that are difficult to predict at this point.",

          "chunk_text": "## -U.S. commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products\n\nPayers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from the consolidation of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. With  increasing  frequency,  payers  are  adopting  benefit  plan  changes  that  shift  a  greater  proportion  of  drug  costs  to  patients.  Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and more significant  limitations  on  patients'  use  of  manufacturer  commercial  copay  assistance  programs.  Further,  government  regulation  of payers may affect these trends. For example, CMS finalized a policy in May 2020 (for plan years starting on or after January 1, 2021, and  remains  standing  policy  for  2022)  that  has  caused  commercial  payers  to  more  widely  adopt  copay  accumulator  adjustment programs. Payers have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their  formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as Step Therapy, or requiring that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mailorder  pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies. Payers have also chosen to exclude certain  indications  for  which  our  products  are  approved  or  chosen  to  exclude  coverage  entirely.  For  example,  some  payers  require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria,  and  these  requirements  have  limited,  and  may  continue  to  limit,  patient  access  to  Repatha  treatment.  In  an  effort  to  reduce barriers  to  access,  we  reduced  the  net  price  of  Repatha  by  providing  greater  discounts  and  rebates  to  payers,  including  PBMs  that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use. For example, in late 2018 and early 2019, in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare, and on December 31,  2019,  we  discontinued  the  higher  list  price  option  for  Repatha.  Despite  these  net  and  list  price  reductions,  some  payers  have restricted,  and  may  continue  to  restrict,  patient  access  and  have  and  may  continue  to  change  formulary  coverage  for  Repatha,  seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, and negatively affect Repatha sales.\n\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements  and  limiting  patient  access  and  usage.  For  example,  in  the  United  States,  as  of  the  beginning  of  2021,  the  top  five integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 85% of all pharmacy prescriptions. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers, and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, CVS, Express Scripts and United Health Group, respectively, each created Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their respective leverage to negotiate deeper discounts. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial  payers  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  product  sales,  business  and  results  of  operations.  Policy  reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or  consequences  for  our  business  and  how  we  interact  with  these  entities.  See Concentration  of  sales  at  certain  of  our  wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\n-Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products\n\nOutside the United States, we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Part I, Item 1.  Business-Reimbursement. IRP has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external  benchmark  of  a  product's  price  in  other  countries.  IRP  policies  can  change  quickly  and  frequently  and  may  not  reflect differences  in  the  burden  of  disease,  indications,  market  structures,  or  affordability  differences  across  countries  or  regions.  Other expenditure control practices, including but not limited to the use of revenue clawbacks, rebates and percentage caps on price increases, are  used  in  various  foreign  jurisdictions  as  well.  In  addition,  countries  may  refuse  to  reimburse  or  may  restrict  the  reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA's approval of Repatha for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for Repatha in France prior to 2020 was limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with HoFH) following a national health technology assessment, which had limited our efforts in France to expand Repatha access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region.

In January 2025, CMS announced the next 15 drugs for Medicare price setting that will be applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, which includes Otezla. Also under the IRA, starting on January 1, 2024, Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning on January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance will become reduced in the catastrophic phase (resulting in a shift and increase of such costs to Part D plans and manufacturers, including by requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs). Further, the IRA created a mechanism for CMS to collect rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation. We began to accrue for rebate obligations on October 1, 2022 for Medicare Part D and on January 1, 2023 for Medicare Part B.\n\nOther potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; increasing transparency in drug pricing; using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices; referencing foreign prices; and changes to government rebate programs. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida to move forward with its importation program proposal, which excludes biologics. CMS also issued a proposed Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rule that would have required manufacturers to aggregate or 'stack' all rebates, discounts or other price concessions made to separate, unrelated entities across the pharmaceutical supply chain on a given unit of product to determine the 'Best Price,' a metric that is used to determine Medicaid rebates and 340B statutory rates. This proposal was not finalized but remains a policy that could be reconsidered in the future. Further, at the state level, eight states (Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish PDABs to identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and in four states (Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington) include authority for the state PDAB to set upper payment limits on certain drugs for in-state patients, payers and providers.\n\nIn  many  countries  other  than  the  United  States,  government-sponsored  healthcare  systems  are  the  primary  payers  for  drugs  and  biologics.  With  increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in rebates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many governments use health technology assessment organizations to judge the added benefit of new treatments over existing ones, metrics which are then used to set reimbursement prices and/or set coverage limits. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that governments will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The EU is currently undergoing a review and revision of its pharmaceutical legislation. Various proposals are under consideration with the EU Council, followed by a negotiation among the EU government to agree to a final law. Full implementation is not expected until 2027 or later. The new legislation, if implemented, will likely have a significant impact on the landscape for access and pricing decisions within EU Member States.\n\nThe dynamics and developments discussed above create pressures on the pricing and potential usage of our products and on the industry. G iven the diverse interests  in  play  between  payers,  biopharmaceutical  manufacturers,  policy  makers,  healthcare  providers  and  independent  organizations,  if  and  whether  the  parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:\n\n- investing billions of dollars annually in R&amp;D;\n- pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;\n- developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;\n- partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;\n- providing patient support and education programs;\n- helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and\n- working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and in which patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.\n\nSee  Item  1A.

          "chunk_text": "In A pril 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort sy stem. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining order staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other parties (the New Protected Parties).\n\nAlso in A pril 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the Company and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained in force until late A ugust 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court's extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for those cases filed in the federal court ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted to proceed.\n\nFurthermore, in A pril 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed by similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023, the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the decision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of A ppeals. In October 2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL's petition for a direct appeal. In July 2024, the Third Circuit issued a non-precedential opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy case.\n\nIn October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision; (ii) pursuing a consensual 'prepackaged' bankruptcy case, as 'strongly encouraged' by the Bankruptcy Court in its dismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative claims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company's talc powder products. In December 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC (\"LLT\").\n\nFollowing the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were reactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a multi-district litigation (M DL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the M DL, case-specific discovery proceeded. The M DL proceedings have been stayed by order of the bankruptcy court in the Red River Bankruptcy case discussed below. In M arch 2024, the court granted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert hearing prior to the trial. The briefing on the renewed Daubert issues was completed in August 2024.\n\nIn M ay 2024, the Company commenced a three-month solicitation period of its proposed consensual 'prepackaged' Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the 'Proposed Plan') for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and future claims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $6.475 billion payable over 25 years (nominal value of approximately $8.0 billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The claims encompassed by the Proposed Plan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its talc powder products.\n\nIn A ugust 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited liability companies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (\"Red River\"); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (\"Pecos River\"); and (3) New Holdco (Texas) LLC. A s a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were separated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated to Pecos River.\n\nIn September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red River filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the Company's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Red River also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to extend the automatic stay to additional non-debtor entities. Prior to filing, the initial proposed plan was amended to, among other things, increase the proposed resolution by $1.75 billion.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n95",

      "question": "How did the patent expiration strategy for LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS\u2122 (sotorasib)'s crystalline form and pharmaceutical compositions change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this imply about Amgen's evolving intellectual property positioning in oncology treatments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen listed two U.S. patent entries for LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS\u2122 (sotorasib): one covering 'Compounds and pharmaceutical compositions' expiring on 5/21/2038, and another covering 'Crystalline form, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment' expiring on 5/20/2040. In 2023, Amgen maintained the same 5/20/2040 expiration for the 'Crystalline form, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment' but added a separate U.S. patent entry for 'Methods of treatment' expiring on 9/15/2040. This indicates a strategic expansion of IP protection, extending treatment method claims while maintaining the core composition and crystalline form coverage. The addition of a later-expiring method of treatment patent suggests Amgen is reinforcing its long-term market exclusivity and competitive positioning in the oncology space for this KRAS G12C inhibitor.",

      "question": "How did the inclusion of Lynparza in Merck's key product portfolio from 2022 to 2023 impact the company's dependence on its oncology segment, especially in light of the growing revenue concentration from Keytruda and Gardasil?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck disclosed Lynparza as a key product contributing to alliance revenue, specifically in oncology for treating advanced ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. By 2023, Lynparza remained part of the key product portfolio, which also included Keytruda and Gardasil/Gardasil 9. In 2023, these two products alone accounted for 56% of Merck's total sales, signaling a growing revenue concentration. This evolution suggests that while Lynparza continued to be a strategic asset, Merck's financial dependence on its oncology segment, particularly Keytruda, increased significantly year-over-year, heightening the risk associated with market exclusivity loss and competitive pressures.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, MDT disclosed that its mutual funds had a fair value of $125 million, all of which was measured using Level 1 inputs. In fiscal year 2023, the fair value of mutual funds decreased to $106 million, with the entire amount still measured using Level 1 inputs. This $19 million decline indicates a reduction in the company's exposure to mutual funds, suggesting a strategic shift in its short-term investment portfolio toward potentially more stable or differently allocated assets.",

      "question": "How did AbbVie's legal strategy around Vraylar evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to its subsidiary Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited's role in patent enforcement and the drug's therapeutic positioning?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie's subsidiary Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited was actively involved in patent enforcement litigation over Vraylar (cariprazine), alongside other subsidiaries, to prevent generic competition from companies like Sun Pharmaceutical and Aurobindo Pharma. By 2024, Vraylar was explicitly positioned in AbbVie's 10-K filing as a core neuroscience product with specific therapeutic indications including schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and major depressive disorder. This evolution suggests that AbbVie transitioned from a defensive legal posture focused on protecting intellectual property to a more strategic commercial and therapeutic positioning of Vraylar within its neuroscience portfolio, likely leveraging the earlier legal actions to secure market exclusivity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABBV(2022) \u2192 Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited: AbbVie's subsidiary was engaged in litigation to enforce Vraylar-related patents against generic drug manufacturers.",

        "Hop 3: Vraylar \u2190 ABBV(2024): Vraylar was disclosed as a key neuroscience product with detailed therapeutic indications, indicating a mature commercial role in AbbVie\u2019s portfolio."

      "answer": "In 2023, GILD recognized revenue from Symtuza through its exclusive supply of Gilead Compounds to Janssen, which was tied to Janssen\u2019s sales of the product. By 2024, the intellectual property license and supply obligations were accounted for as a single performance obligation, with GILD recognizing its share of Symtuza revenue in the period when Janssen\u2019s sales occurred. This shift indicates a deeper financial dependency on Janssen's pricing and sales execution, as GILD's revenue became more directly and immediately tied to Janssen's market performance, rather than being buffered by supply chain dynamics.",

The intellectual property license and supply obligations related to the G ilead Compounds are accounted for as a single performance obligation. As the license was deemed to be the predominant item to which the revenue share relates, we recognize our share of the Symtuza revenue in the period when the corresponding sales of Symtuza by Janssen occur. We record our share of the Symtuza revenue as Product sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily because we supply the Gilead Compounds to Janssen for Symtuza.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including withdrawal of a product from the market, material breach by either party or expiry of the revenue share payment term. Janssen may terminate the agreement without cause on a country-by-country basis, in which case Gilead has the right to become the selling party for such country(ies) if the product has launched but has been on the market for fewer than 10 years. Janssen may also terminate the entire agreement without cause.\n\n## Japan Tobacco\n\nIn 2005, Japan Tobacco, Inc. ('Japan Tobacco') granted us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir, a novel HIV  integrase inhibitor, in all countries of the world, excluding Japan, where Japan Tobacco retained such rights. Effective December 2018, we entered into an agreement with Japan Tobacco to acquire the rights to market and distribute certain products in our HIV  portfolio in Japan and to ex pand our rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir to include Japan. We are responsible for the marketing of the products as of January 1, 2019.\n\nWe are responsible for seeking regulatory approval in our territories and are required to use diligent efforts to commercialize elvitegravir for the treatment of HIV infection. We bear all costs and expenses associated with such commercialization efforts and pay a royalty to Japan Tobacco based on our product sales. Our sales of these products are included in Product sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Royalties due to Japan Tobacco are included in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Royalty expenses recognized were $139 million, $167 million and $198 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2018 agreement, we paid Japan Tobacco $559 million in cash and recognized an intangible asset of $550 million reflecting the estimated fair value of the marketing-related rights acquired from Japan Tobacco. The intangible asset is being amortized over nine years, representing the period over which the majority of the benefits are ex pected to be derived from the applicable products in our HIV  portfolio. The amortization ex pense is classified as selling ex pense and recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including material breach by either party or expiry of royalty payment term. We may also terminate the entire agreement without cause.\n\n## Everest\n\nIn April 2019, Everest Medicines ('Everest') and Immunomedics entered into an agreement granting Everest an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Trodelvy in  G reater  China,  South  Korea,  Singapore,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  V ietnam,  Thailand,  Malaysia  and  Mongolia  (the  'Territories').  G ilead  subsequently acquired Immunomedics in October 2020 and assumed the Everest license and supply agreement, which provided for certain sales milestones and royalties payments to  be  made to  G ilead  and  was  recorded  as  a  $175  million  finite-lived  asset  as  part  of  the  purchase  accounting.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022,  we  reacquired  all development and commercialization rights for Trodelvy from Everest and terminated the previous agreement. Under the terms of the new agreement, G ilead made $280 million in upfront termination payments to Everest, of which $84 million was made in 2022 and $196 million was made in 2023. In addition, Everest is eligible to receive up to $175 million in potential additional payments upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. We accounted for the new agreement as a contract termination, which includes the reacquisition of commercial rights and the settlement of our pre-existing relationship with Everest. As a result, we recorded an expense of $406 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022, which primarily represents the upfront costs and write-off of the remaining value of the pre-existing asset related to the prior agreement. Simultaneously, we recorded an acquired finite-lived asset with a fair value of $50 million for the commercial rights reacquired for products approved in the Territories.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY acknowledged that its key biologics\u2014Opdivo, Yervoy, Orencia, Reblozyl, and Empliciti\u2014faced heightened risk of biosimilar competition due to the 12-year FDA data protection period nearing expiration, which could lead to rapid revenue erosion. This concern was echoed across the industry, as seen in Eli Lilly\u2019s 2022 filings, where loss of exclusivity for biologics like Trulicity and Taltz was linked to steep revenue declines following biosimilar entry. In response, BMY's 2023 strategy focused on mitigating the long-term impact of biosimilar erosion by acquiring Mirati (completed in January 2024), Karuna, and RayzeBio, and entering a global strategic collaboration with SystImmune. These moves were aimed at bolstering its biologics and next-generation immunotherapy pipeline, signaling a clear pivot to innovation-driven growth to offset the anticipated revenue losses from biosimilar competition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

          "chunk_text": "- We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; we have lost or soon will lose effective intellectual property protection for a number of our products, which has resulted and is likely to continue to result in rapid and severe declines in revenues.\n\nA number of our products, including Alimta and Forteo, have recently lost, or soon will lose, significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S. as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S. We have faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the loss of such intellectual property protection. In particular, we expect that the entry of generic competition for Alimta in the U.S. following the loss of patent exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\n\nCertain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. For non-biologic products, loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the U.S. For biologics (such as Humalog, Humulin, Erbitux, Cyramza, Trulicity, Taltz, and Emgality), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. Generic pharmaceutical companies could also introduce a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation.\n\nThere is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. In addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters,\" and Item 1, \"Business Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,\" for more details.\n\n- Our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines. Without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development, as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time, depending on local laws and regulations. Changes to such laws and regulations could reduce protections for our innovative products. In the U.S., in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCIA, which applies to biologic products, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering pharmaceutical products. As a result, we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products, including biologics, will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. In addition, a separate IPR process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use IPR proceedings as an alternative to Hatch-Waxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain. However, if our patents are challenged through this expedited review process, even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent, our win provides limited precedential value at the PTAB and no precedential value in federal district court, meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors. We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. In addition, intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weak and we face additional risks to our intellectual property rights, including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch.

      "question": "How did the introduction of IRA-mandated price negotiation for Eliquis in 2024 impact BMY's revenue projections compared to the 2022 risk assessments around generic competition for the same drug?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY expressed concern that generic competition for Eliquis could significantly erode market exclusivity and revenues, citing potential adverse litigation outcomes in the EU that could allow early entry of generic apixaban. By 2024, the risk shifted from generic competition to regulatory pricing pressure under the IRA, with HHS setting a 'maximum fair price' for Eliquis effective January 1, 2026, which is expected to accelerate revenue erosion even before patent expiry. This indicates a transition from market-driven risk (generics) to policy-driven risk (price negotiation), both of which threaten Eliquis' revenue stream but through different mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BMY(2022) \u2192 Eliquis: BMY acknowledged in 2022 that adverse litigation outcomes in the EU could allow generic apixaban to enter the market before patent expiry, threatening revenue and exclusivity.",
        "Hop 2: Eliquis \u2192 IRA: In 2024, Eliquis was directly impacted by the IRA, with HHS setting a 'maximum fair price' effective 2026, marking the first round of government price negotiation under the act.",
        "Hop 3: IRA \u2190 BMY(2024): BMY's 2024 disclosures reflect an evolving risk landscape where the IRA's pricing mechanisms are now a primary concern, replacing earlier fears of generic competition as the main threat to Eliquis revenue."

          "chunk_text": "generic products, which negatively impacts the protections afforded the Company. Lower-priced generics or biosimilars for BMS biologic products or competing biologics could negatively impact our volumes and prices.\n\nIn  addition,  both  the  U.S.  Congress  and  the  U.S.  FDA  have  taken  steps  to  promote  the  development  and  approval  of generic drugs and biosimilar biologics. For example, in December 2019, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation intended to  facilitate  generic  companies'  access  to  drug  samples.  Section  610  of  the  Further  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act, 2020, provides generic and biosimilar developers a private right of action to obtain sufficient quantities of drug samples from  the  reference  product' s  manufacturer  in  order  to  conduct  testing  necessary  to  obtain  approval  for  generic  or biosimilar products. This law has the potential to have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nThere is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates disclosed in this 2021 Form 10-K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance.\n\n## Certain novel approaches to the treatment of diseases, such as chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T cell therapy, may present significant challenges and risks for us.\n\nThe  development  of  novel  approaches  for  the  treatment  of  diseases,  such  as  our  acquisition  in  November  2019  of Celgene's and Juno's CAR T cell therapy programs, including Breyanzi (liso-cel) and Abecma (ide-cel), presents many new challenges and risks due to the unique nature of genetic modification of patient cells ex vivo using certain viruses to reengineer  these  cells  to  ultimately  treat  diseases,  including  obtaining  regulatory  approval  from  U.S.  FDA  and  other regulatory agencies that have limited experience with the development of cellular therapies involving genetic modification of patient cells; developing and deploying consistent and reliable processes, while limiting contamination, for engineering a patient's cells ex vivo and infusing genetically modified cells back into the patient; developing processes for the safe administration of cellular therapies, including long-term follow-up for patients receiving cellular therapies; and sourcing additional clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our potential CAR T products. The use of reengineered cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by the regulatory, patient or medical communities.\n\nFurther, we may not be able to satisfactorily establish the safety and efficacy or the reliability of these therapies through health  authority  approval,  or  demonstrate  the  potential  advantages  and  side  effects  compared  to  existing  and  future therapies. Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Furthermore, certain payment models could impact the financial feasibility of making CAR T cell therapies available in certain markets or by certain treatment sites, thereby limiting patient access. To date, only a few products  that  involve  the  genetic  modification  of  patient  cells  have  been  approved  for  commercial  sale.  Moreover,  the safety profiles of cellular therapies may adversely influence public perception and may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials, or if approved, of physicians and payers to subscribe to these novel treatment approaches. If we fail to overcome these and other challenges, or if significant adverse events are reported from similar therapies,  our  development  of  these  novel  treatment  approaches  may  be  hampered  or  delayed,  which  could  adversely affect our future anticipated revenues and/or profitability related to these therapeutic programs. In addition, we could also face  difficulties  in  manufacturing  CAR  T  cell  therapies,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  future  anticipated  revenues and/or profitability related to our CAR T cell therapies. See ' -We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.'\n\n## We face intense competition from other manufacturers and expect to see increasing market penetration of lower-priced generic products.\n\nThe future growth of BMS is dependent on the market access, uptake and expansion for marketed brands, new product introductions,  new  indications,  product  extensions  and  co-promotional  activities  with  alliance  partners.  Competition  is keen and as we lose exclusivity for some of our marketed brands lower-priced generic products will increasingly penetrate our  markets.  Generic  challenges  to  our  products  can  also  arise  at  any  time,  and  our  patents  may  not  prevent  the emergence of generic competition for our products. For example, if we receive an adverse litigation decision in a country in the EU where our Eliquis composition of matter patents and related Supplementary Protection Certificates are being challenged (see 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies'), we may not be able to prevent generic apixaban products from being introduced in such country prior to our estimated minimum market exclusivity date. In some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the United States or in the EU; political and social pressure has also pushed legislation and other measures that promote the use  of  generic  and  biosimilar  products.  In  addition,  we  face  competition  from  new  products  entering  the  market, particularly in IO. New products may have (i) lower prices, (ii) superior efficacy (benefit) or safety (risk) profiles (whether actual  or  perceived),  (iii)  technological  advantages  that  may  make  such  products  more  convenient  to  use,  (iv)  better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, (v) more effective marketing programs and/or other differentiating factors that make it harder for our products to compete. We also face intense competition for external partnerships, joint ventures and  acquisition  targets  that  can  help  develop  and  bring  new  products  to  markets.  Business  combinations  among  our competitors and major third-party payers may increase competition",

          "chunk_text": "## Economic and Market Factors\n\n## Governmental Actions\n\nAs regulators continue to focus on prescription drugs, our products are facing increased pressures across the portfolio. These pressures stem from legislative and policy changes, including price controls, pharmaceutical market access, discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the U.S., EU and other regions around the world. These pressures have resulted in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse, which can negatively impact our results of operations (including intangible asset impairment charges), operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. The IRA directs (i) the federal government to 'negotiate' prices for select high-cost Medicare Part D (beginning in 2026) and Part B (beginning in 2028) drugs that are more than nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their initial FDA approval, (ii) manufacturers to pay a rebate for Medicare Part B and  Part  D  drugs  when  prices  increase  faster  than  inflation  and  (iii)  the  formation  of  the  Part  D  Manufacturer  Program  which  replaced  the  Part  D  CG DP  and established a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries as of January 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for 10% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and 20% after that cap is reached. In August 2024, as part of the first round of government price setting pursuant to the IRA, the HHS announced the \"maximum fair  price\"  for  a  30-day  equivalent  supply  of Eliquis ,  which  applies  to  the  U.S.  Medicare  channel  effective  January  1,  2026.  In  January  2025,  the  HHS  selected Pomalyst as a medicine subject to \"negotiation\" for government-set prices beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our results of operations, and it is possible that these changes may result in a material impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn  addition,  in  December  2023,  the  Biden  administration  released  a  proposed  framework  that  for  the  first  time  proposed  that  a  drug's  price  can  be  a  factor  in determining that the drug is not accessible to the public and, therefore, that the government could exercise 'march-in rights' and license it to a third party to manufacture.  We cannot predict whether the  Trump administration will finalize the draft framework or if the government will propose other drug pricing policy changes. If pursued and finalized, these policies could reduce prices and reimbursement for certain of our products and could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\n\nAt  the  state  level,  multiple  states  have  passed,  are  pursuing  or  are  considering  government  action  via  legislation  or  regulations  to  change  drug  pricing  and reimbursement (e.g., establishing prescription drug affordability boards, implementing manufacturer mandates tied to the Federal Public Health Service Act drug pricing program, etc.). Some of these state-level actions may also influence federal and other state policies and legislation. G iven the current uncertainty surrounding the adoption, timing and implementation of many of these measures, as well as pending litigation challenging such laws, we are unable to predict their full impact on our business. However, such measures could modify or decrease access, coverage, or reimbursement of our products, or result in significant changes to our sales or pricing practices, which could have a material impact on our revenues and results of operations. With respect to the Federal Public Health Service Act drug pricing program, certain states have enacted laws regulating manufacturer pricing obligations under the program to date. Several additional states are considering similar potential legislation or other government actions, and we expect other states may do the same in the future.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with the IRA, the following changes have been made to U.S. tax laws, including (i) a 15% minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations on adjusted financial statement income beginning in 2023 and (ii) a non-deductible 1% excise tax provision on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. Furthermore, countries are in the process of enacting changes to their tax laws to implement the agreement by the OECD to establish a global minimum tax. See risk  factors  on  these  items  included  under  'Part  I-Item  1A.  Risk  Factors-Product,  Industry  and  Operational  Risks-Increased  pricing  pressure  and  other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins', '-We could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected' and '-Changes to tax regulations could negatively impact our earnings.'",

      "question": "How did the increase in state-level drug affordability legislation targeting price competition in 2024 impact LLY's pricing strategy and Medicaid rebate obligations compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, LLY identified price competition as a key risk factor, noting that generic and biosimilar entrants were pressuring branded product pricing and sales volumes. By 2024, this competitive pressure was amplified by state-level legislation, such as PDABs in Colorado, Maine, and New Jersey, which sought to set upper payment limits on drugs like ENBREL, directly constraining LLY's pricing flexibility. These legislative actions, combined with IRA-driven federal policies, led to increased Medicaid rebate obligations for LLY, as price increases above inflation triggered additional penalties and rebates, particularly under Medicaid and 340B programs. Specifically, LLY reported in 2024 that Medicaid rebates were calculated at a minimum of 23.1% plus adjustments for inflation, and the expansion of 340B pricing further eroded revenue margins. This represents a clear evolution from competitive market forces in 2023 to regulatory-driven pricing constraints in 2024 that directly affected LLY's financial exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2023) \u2192 Price Competition: LLY identified price competition as a risk factor, noting that branded products face pressure from generics and biosimilars, leading to reduced sales and price cuts.",
        "Hop 2: Price Competition \u2192 State Legislation: In 2024, state-level policies such as PDABs and Medicaid rebate adjustments were enacted in response to rising drug prices, directly targeting price-setting mechanisms and limiting manufacturer pricing power.",
        "Hop 3: State Legislation \u2190 LLY(2024): LLY reported in 2024 that these state-level pricing laws and Medicaid rebate rules increased their financial obligations and constrained pricing strategies, with Medicaid rebates at a minimum of 23.1% plus inflation adjustments."

          "chunk_text": "years such that, by 2031, approximately 100 drugs could be subject to such set prices). The Medicare price setting process for the first 10 drugs subject to Medicare price setting in Part D began in 2023 , which includes ENBREL, our product that currently generates considerable revenues. In 2024, CMS set a price for ENBREL under Medicare Part D that is significantly lower than currently applicable, beginning on January 1, 2026, which we expect will negatively impact its profitability in Medicare. See Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of operations-Product sales-ENBREL. In January 2025, CMS announced the next 15 drugs for Medicare price setting that will be applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, which includes Otezla. Depending on the growth and success of our medicines, other of our medicines may also be subject to selection by CMS in the next, or in a future, cycle of mandatory Medicare price setting. If other of our medicines are selected by CMS for Medicare price setting, we may be required to accept a price set by the government for Medicare similar to the process that was applied to ENBREL. Also under the IRA, Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance  will  be  reduced  in  the  catastrophic  phase  (resulting  in  a  shift  and  increase  of  such  costs  to  Part  D  plans  and  manufacturers,  including  by  requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs). Further, the IRA inflation penalties allows CMS to collect rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation. Such rebate obligations began to accrue October 1, 2022 for Medicare Part D and January 1, 2023 for Medicare Part B, but CMS has not yet issued invoices and has some discretion as to when to issue such invoices to manufacturers. We expect that several of our products will be subject to IRA inflation penalties, and several of our products have been on lists that are issued and updated on a quarterly basis by CMS under a related program under which Medicare beneficiaries are charged reduced coinsurance if price increases exceed inflation. The IRA's Medicare price setting and Medicare redesign are likely to have a material adverse effect on our sales, our business and our results of operations, and such impact is expected to increase through the end of the decade and will depend on factors including the extent of our portfolio's ex posure to Medicare reimbursement, the rate of inflation over time, the number of our products selected for Medicare price setting and the timing of market entry of generic or biosimilar competition. Further, following the enactment of the IRA, the environment remains dynamic and U.S. policymakers continue to demonstrate interest  in  health  care  and  drug  pricing  changes.  For  ex ample,  in April  2024,  CMS  finalized  policy  changes  that  will  give  Part  D  plans  more  flex ibility  to  substitute biosimilars for innovator products on formularies in 2025. Additionally, various government agencies have taken actions designed to reduce expenditures on prescription drugs. For example, HHS released a report with drug pricing proposals that seek to promote competition. The USPTO has also taken steps to strengthen coordination with the FDA to address perceived impediments to generic drug and biosimilar competition. Other CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can also significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed.\n\nWe also face risks related to the reporting of pricing data that affects reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.\n\n-Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, access to, and have affected, and may continue to affect, sales of our products\n\nAt the state level, legislation, government actions, and ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, PDABs, drug importation programs, reference pricing schemes, and other drug pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to report to the state proprietary pricing information or provide advance notice of certain price increases.\n\nStates are also enacting laws referencing the IRA and seeking to regulate and prohibit restrictions on the 340B Program. For example, following the passage of the IRA, bills have been proposed in multiple states that would apply the drug price caps set by HHS for Medicare to drug prices in an individual state, and such references to  IRA  price  caps  have  also  been  included  in  PDAB  legislation.  For  Medicaid  patients,  states  have  established  a  Medicaid  drug  spending  cap  (New  Y ork)  and implemented  a  new  review  and  supplemental  rebate  negotiation  process  (Massachusetts).  Eight  states  (Colorado,  Maine,  New  Hampshire,  New  Jersey,  Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish PDABs to identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and four such states include authority for the state PDABs to set upper payment limits on certain drugs for in-state patients, payers and providers. In 2024, no fewer than 17 states introduced PDAB legislation. The eight states with enacted PDAB laws are in various phases of implementation, with Colorado's PDAB being the furthest along. The Colorado PDAB deemed three of five drugs 'unaffordable,' including ENBREL, and are subject to rulemaking to establish an Upper Payment Limit (UPL) commencing March 2025 and that could be effective as soon as the fourth quarter of 2025. Further, inappropriate ex panded utilization of the 340B Program from broadened application of the 340B discounts has had, and is",

          "chunk_text": "The IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiv eness of inv estment in small molecule innov ation. The IRA can cause changes to dev elopment approach and timing and inv estments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nHeightened governmental scrutiny ov er the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products and the practices of pharmacy benefit managers and other supply chain entities has also resulted in sev eral U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, rev iew the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, require adv ance notice of list price increases, establish upper payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability rev iew boards, allow the importation of drugs from other countries, address pharmacy benefit manager practices, and reform gov ernment program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Pharmacy benefit manager reform could be pursued or enacted in 2025. Restrictiv e or unfav orable pricing, cov erage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by gov ernments, regulatory agencies, courts, or priv ate payers could also adv ersely impact our business and financial results. Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. executiv e branch and regulatory authorities worldwide, could intensify these efforts and adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\n\nIn the U.S., we are required to prov ide rebates to the federal gov ernment and state gov ernments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under v arious federal and state healthcare programs, including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (a minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for price increases abov e the consumer price index ov er time) and discounts to priv ate entities who treat patients in certain types of healthcare facilities intended to serv e low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B cov ered entities). Additionally, an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified gov ernment programs, such as Medicare Part B and Part D, and Medicaid.\n\nChanges to the 340B program or the Medicaid programs could hav e a material adv erse impact on our business. For example, continued expansion of the 340B program and growth of entities claiming entitlement to 340B pricing, including in ways that may be inconsistent with the statutory scheme, impacts our rev enue on an increasing percentage of sales. Changes to the calculation of rebates under the Medicaid program could also increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and decrease the prices charged to 340B cov ered entities.\n\nWe have implemented a Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System applicable to sales through the 340B program, which generally limits distribution of 340B-priced product to: (i) cov ered entities and their child sites; or (ii) if a cov ered entity lacks an in-house outpatient pharmacy, a single contract pharmacy designated by a cov ered entity to establish a 340B bill to/ship to arrangement. Claims-lev el data is ordinarily required for any contract pharmacy. Our Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System contains certain exceptions that permit broader contract pharmacy usage, including for \"penny priced\" insulin products, prov ided that the cov ered entity passes through all discounts to eligible patients at the point of sale and meets other conditions. We believ e our Contract Pharmacy Limited Distribution System complies with the 340B statute, but it remains subject to ongoing inquiries and litigation that could hav e a material impact on our business, as discussed in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 16: Contingencies.\" Other aspects of the 340B program, including the manner in which manufacturers can offer 340B pricing, and proper definitions of \"patient\" and \"child site\" under the 340B statute, are also subject to ongoing litigation by Lilly and/or other parties, the resolution of which could impact the growth and scope of the 340B program. For example, on Nov ember 14, 2024, Lilly sued the Health Resources and Serv ices Administration (HRSA) over its purported rejection of Lilly's plan to implement a cash replenishment model to make 340B pricing av ailable to 340B cov ered entities, in place of the current product replenishment model.\n\nRebates are also negotiated in the priv ate sector. We pay rebates to priv ate payers that prov ide prescription drug benefits to seniors cov ered by Medicare and to priv ate payers that prov ide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitiv e products and generics in the same class.\n\nFor a discussion of risks related to how we price our products, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We are party to litigation and inv estigations related to our products, how we price or commercialize our products, and other aspects of our business, which could adv ersely affect our business, and we are self-insured for such matters.\"",

      "question": "How did the changes in BMY's regulatory exclusivity protections for Opdivo between 2023 and 2024 affect the company's ability to maintain market exclusivity and defend against generic competition in the U.S. biologics market?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BMY highlighted the risks associated with losing market exclusivity earlier than expected due to generic challenges and weaker patent protections in certain countries, which could negatively impact revenue and earnings. Market exclusivity was described as being determined by both patent rights and regulatory exclusivity, with the latter providing a 12-year protection period for biologics in the U.S. By 2024, BMY confirmed that Opdivo, one of its key biologic products, was still subject to the U.S. 12-year regulatory exclusivity period, which prevents biosimilar approval until 12 years after initial FDA approval. However, the increased frequency of patent challenges from generic and biosimilar manufacturers raised uncertainty about the duration of market exclusivity, even with regulatory protections in place. The interplay between evolving patent litigation risks and fixed regulatory exclusivity timelines created a more complex environment for BMY to defend Opdivo\u2019s market position, especially as generic manufacturers could file challenges during the later stages of exclusivity periods.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BMY(2023) \u2192 Market Exclusivity: BMY expressed concerns about the potential loss of market exclusivity for key products due to patent challenges and regulatory pressures, especially in the U.S. and EU, with specific mention of Opdivo\u2019s complex supply and patent landscape.",
        "Hop 2: Market Exclusivity \u2192 Regulatory Exclusivity: Regulatory exclusivity was identified as a key factor in determining market exclusivity, particularly for biologics like Opdivo, which benefit from a 12-year U.S. exclusivity period.",
        "Hop 3: Regulatory Exclusivity \u2190 BMY(2024): In 2024, BMY reiterated the 12-year regulatory exclusivity for biologics but noted increased risks from generic and biosimilar challenges, which could undermine the effective duration of exclusivity even if regulatory timelines remained unchanged."

          "chunk_text": "An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovator's NDA is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the generic product. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV  certification. The innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, ANDAs including Paragraph IV  certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these ANDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines can also receive several types of regulatory exclusivity. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, a generic manufacturer may file its ANDA after the fourth year  of  the  five-year  regulatory  ex clusivity  period.  Our  marketed  chemical  products  include Eliquis,  Revlimid,  Pomalyst,  Sprycel,  Zeposia,  Camzyos,  Sotyktu , Augtyro, Krazati, and Cobenfy .\n\n## Biologic products (includes CAR-T cell therapy products)\n\nQualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative  biological  product  was  first  approved  by  the  FDA.  Our  marketed  biologic  products  include Opdivo , Opdivo  Qvantig, Orencia, Yervoy,  Reblozyl, Opdualag, Breyanzi, Abecma and Abraxane.\n\nIn the U.S., medicines (chemically synthesized or biologically derived) may also receive an additional six months of market exclusivity (added to certain patent terms and regulatory exclusivities) if certain agreed-upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market ex clusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions may limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory ex clusivity.\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended for up to five years to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 15 years from the date of drug approval. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis. The EU provides an additional six months of exclusivity added to the extended patent term if certain pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized  procedure.'  This  procedure  is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA.\n\nAfter obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout  the  EU,  all  products  for  which  marketing  authorizations  have  been  filed  after  October  and  November  2005  are  subject  to  an  '8+2+1'  regulatory exclusivity regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with ex isting treatments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY relied on Ono to secure several regulatory approvals for Opdivo in Japan and the EU, including for Hodgkin lymphoma in pediatric patients, first-line treatment of unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma, and combination therapies for RCC and esophageal cancers. These approvals expanded Opdivo\u2019s geographic and therapeutic footprint. By 2023, BMY strategically emphasized broadening Opdivo\u2019s use into new tumor types and earlier lines of therapy, citing the success of these prior approvals as part of their commercial and development momentum. The company also highlighted plans to expand into additional indications both as monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other agents, leveraging the established global regulatory and clinical foundation built in part through Ono\u2019s contributions in 2022.",

Ono is entitled to receive royalties of 4% in North America and 15% in all territories excluding the three countries listed above, subject to customary adjustments.\n\n## Nektar\n\nIn  2018,  BMS  and  Nektar  commenced  a  worldwide  license  and  collaboration  for  the  development  and  commercialization  of Bempegaldesleukin  (NKTR-214),  Nektar's  investigational  immuno-stimulatory  therapy  designed  to  selectively  expand  specific cancer-fighting T cells and natural killer cells directly in the tumor micro-environment. In January 2020, the parties amended the collaboration agreement. The Opdivo and NKTR-214 combination therapy is currently in Phase III clinical studies for metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and RCC. A joint development plan agreed by the parties as part of the original agreement, and updated as part of the January 2020 amendment, specifies development in certain indications and tumor types  with  each  party  responsible  for  the  supply  of  their  own  product.  BMS's  share  of  the  development  costs  associated  with therapies comprising a BMS medicine used in combination with NKTR-214 is 67.5%, subject to certain cost caps for Nektar. The January  2020  amendment  retains  the  cost  sharing  percentages  from  the  original  agreement.  The  parties  will  also  jointly commercialize  the  therapies,  subject  to  regulatory  approval.  BMS's  share  of  global  NKTR-214  profits  and  losses  will  be  35% subject to certain annual loss caps for Nektar.\n\nBMS paid Nektar $1.85 billion for the rights discussed above and 8.3 million shares of Nektar common stock which represented a 4.8% ownership interest.  BMS's equity  ownership  is  subject  to  certain  lock-up,  standstill  and  voting  provisions  for  a  five-year period. The amount of the up-front payment allocated to the equity investment was $800 million after considering Nektar's stock price on the date of closing and current limitations on trading the securities. The remaining $1.05 billion of the up-front payment was allocated to the rights discussed above. BMS will also pay up to $1.8 billion upon the achievement of contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones over the life of the alliance period. Research and development cost reimbursements were $98 million in 2021, $132 million in 2020 and $108 million in 2019.\n\n## 2seventy bio (formerly bluebird)\n\nOn November 4, 2021, bluebird completed the tax-free spin-off of its oncology programs and portfolio into 2seventy bio, Inc., an independent, publicly-traded company.\n\nThe  parties  jointly  develop  and  commercialize  novel  disease-altering  gene  therapy  product  candidates  targeting  BCMA.  The collaboration arrangement began in 2013 and included (i) a right for BMS to license any anti-BCMA products resulting from the collaboration,  (ii)  a  right  for  2seventy  bio  to  participate  in  the  development  and  commercialization  of  any  licensed  products resulting  from  the  collaboration  through  a  50/50  co-development  and  profit  share  in  the  U.S.  in  exchange  for  a  reduction  of milestone  payments,  and  (iii)  sales-based  milestones  and  royalties  payable  to  2seventy  bio  upon  the  commercialization  of  any licensed  products  resulting  from  the  collaboration  if  2seventy  bio  declined  to  exercise  their  co-development  and  profit  sharing rights. The options to license idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121) and bb21217 were exercised in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2022, the parties elected to not pursue further development of bb21217.\n\nAll profits and losses relating to developing, commercializing and manufacturing ide-cel within the U.S. are shared equally. BMS is exclusively responsible for the development and commercialization of ide-cel outside the U.S.\n\nIn  2020,  terms  of  the  collaboration  were  amended  including  certain  manufacturing  obligations.  Both  parties  were  also  released from future exclusivity related to BCMA-directed T cell therapies. BMS paid $200 million to extinguish its obligation for future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on ide-cel, which was included in Research and development expense in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the FDA approved ide-cel (' Abecma ' ) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Net product sales of Abecma  within  the  Alliance  territory  were  $158  million  and  related  profit  sharing  costs  were  $42  million  in  2021.  Cost reimbursements were not material.",

      "question": "How did the 2023 FDA Emergency Use Authorization for Lagevrio influence its 2024 sales performance across different geographic markets, particularly given the 33% overall decline and regional shifts like those in Japan and the U.S.?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Lagevrio received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA for treating high-risk adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, which initially supported its market entry. By 2024, however, global demand had shifted significantly, with a 33% overall sales decline attributed to reduced uptake in several Asia Pacific markets, especially Japan. While the U.S. saw some offsetting growth due to commercial distribution under the EUA, this was insufficient to counterbalance the international downturn. This reflects how the initial regulatory authorization in 2023 set the trajectory for Lagevrio's 2024 sales performance, which was ultimately constrained by evolving geographic demand patterns.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS entered into two four-year reinsurance agreements to reduce required capital and provide collateralized excess of loss reinsurance coverage for its Health Care Benefits segment's group Commercial Insured business. These agreements built on Aetna's historical use of reinsurance, including legacy arrangements like the 2018 sale of Aetna's standalone Medicare Part D plans and the associated reinsurance agreements with WellCare for the 2019 plan year. In 2023, CVS continued this strategy by entering into two additional four-year reinsurance agreements in January 2024\u2014indicating a consistent approach to capital optimization and risk transfer that traces back to Aetna's legacy practices. The continuation of similar structures suggests that Aetna's prior involvement in reinsurance has directly shaped CVS's current approach to managing insurance risk and capital efficiency.",

Reinsurance\n\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance contracts.

('WellCare'), effective December 31, 2018.

      "question": "How did LLY's approach to maintaining exclusivity for biologics change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this suggest about their evolving strategy against biosimilar competition?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LLY expressed significant concern about the threat of biosimilars, especially after the FDA began regulating insulin as biologics under the BPCIA, which could reduce the data requirements for biosimilar entry. They noted that products like Semglee had already been approved as interchangeable biosimilars, increasing substitution risk. By 2023, LLY shifted focus toward leveraging regulatory exclusivity mechanisms, particularly orphan drug exclusivity, which provides 7 years of market protection. This suggests a strategic pivot from emphasizing patent protection and market dynamics to proactively utilizing statutory exclusivity periods to delay biosimilar competition and protect revenue streams.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2022) \u2192 Biologics: LLY expressed concern about biosimilar competition under the BPCIA, noting that insulin products were now regulated as biologics and that interchangeable biosimilars like Semglee had entered the market.",
        "Hop 2: Biologics \u2192 Orphan Drug Exclusivity: Under U.S. law, biologics are eligible for 12 years of exclusivity under the BPCIA, plus potential orphan drug exclusivity for 7 years if treating rare diseases.",
        "Hop 3: Orphan Drug Exclusivity \u2190 LLY(2023): In 2023, LLY emphasized orphan drug exclusivity as a key mechanism to extend market protection for biologics, indicating a strategic shift toward leveraging regulatory exclusivity rather than relying solely on patents."

          "chunk_text": "## Generic Pharmaceuticals\n\nOne of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals. In the U.S. and Europe, the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product, which can cause us to lose a significant portion of the product's revenue in a very short period of time.\n\nFurther, public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In many countries outside the U.S., intellectual property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch.\n\n## Biosimilars\n\nA number of our products and potential new medicines in our clinical-stage pipeline are biologics. In the U.S., the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. Competition for Lilly's biologics may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that, due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. Approval by the FDA ultimately depends on many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.\n\nGlobally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator-developed biologics, including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA and in Europe. The patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market. However, in the U.S., the product exclusivity period under the BPCIA could be affected by recent government proposals and litigation. See \"- Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights.\" In addition, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet entirely clear, and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing. In the U.S., currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" by the FDA will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The FDA has begun to issue \"interchangeable\" designations for biosimilar products.\n\nBiosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. For example, a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro that competes with our product Humalog. On the other hand, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we developed Basaglar, an insulin glargine product, which has the same amino acid sequence as a product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a follow-on biologic in the U.S., and as a biosimilar in Europe and Japan. However, in March 2020, the FDA began regulating all of our insulin products as \"biologics\" rather than \"drugs.\" Based on FDA draft guidance, this change may lessen the amount of data required for competitor biosimilar products to enter the market, some of which could be designated as interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin products at U.S. pharmacies. For example, in June 2020, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for Semglee, a follow-on insulin glargine product that competes with Basaglar in the U.S., and, in July 2021, Semglee received additional FDA approval as a biosimilar that is interchangeable to its reference insulin glargine product. The FDA's interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve and, therefore, the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount primarily reflects $500 million of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. (a)\n\nThe decrease is primarily due to amortization, partially offset by the capitalization of the Comirnaty milestones described above. (b)\n\n## Developed Technology Rights\n\nDeveloped technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\n\n## Brands\n\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\n\n## IPR&amp;D\n\nIPR&amp;D assets represent R&amp;D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

      "question": "How did Gilead's 2022 licensing strategy for Trodelvy in Asia impact its competitive positioning against Bristol Myers Squibb in oncology markets by 2024, particularly in light of BMS's exclusive rights to sotatercept outside the PH field?",
      "answer": "Gilead's 2022 licensing strategy for Trodelvy in Asia, which included an exclusive license valued at $175 million, allowed the company to expand its oncology footprint in key Asian markets while retaining royalty rights. However, by 2024, Gilead found itself in a competitive environment with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), particularly in oncology, where BMS held exclusive rights to sotatercept outside the pulmonary hypertension (PH) field. This exclusive licensing arrangement with Merck meant that BMS could develop and commercialize sotatercept in therapeutic areas that may overlap with Gilead's oncology portfolio. As a result, Gilead's initial licensing of Trodelvy in Asia created a complex dynamic where BMS, now holding exclusive rights to a promising oncology asset in sotatercept, became both a collaborator and a competitor. This dual relationship likely constrained Gilead's strategic options in oncology development and commercialization, particularly in markets where BMS had a strong presence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GILD(2022) \u2192 Exclusive License: Gilead licensed Trodelvy in certain Asian territories for $175 million, aiming to monetize the asset while retaining royalty rights and focusing on core markets.",
        "Hop 2: Exclusive License \u2192 Bristol Myers Squibb: BMS was granted an exclusive license by Merck to develop and commercialize sotatercept outside the PH field, positioning BMS as a key player in oncology and related therapeutic areas.",

The step-up adjustment is recorded in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Income as the inventory is sold to customers and in Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income for inventory used for clinical purposes.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nThe finite-lived intangible asset of $4.6 billion represents the estimated fair value of Trodelvy for metastatic triple-negative breast  cancer  ('TNBC')  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  The  fair  value  was  determined  by  applying  the  income  approach  using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to Trodelvy for metastatic TNBC and a discount rate of 7.0%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value this intangible asset. This intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 12 years.\n\nAcquired  IPR&amp;D  assets  consist  of  Trodelvy  for  hormone  receptor  positive,  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 negative,  metastatic  breast  cancer,  Trodelvy  for  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  Trodelvy  for  urothelial  cancer  ('UC').  The estimated aggregate fair value of $15.8 billion as of the acquisition date was determined by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to these assets and a discount rate of 7.0%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value these intangible assets. Trodelvy for UC was granted accelerated approval by FDA in April 2021 and $1.0 billion was reclassified to finite-lived intangibles from IPR&amp;D. See Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information.\n\nSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset fair values include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including revenue, cost of sales, research and development costs, and sales and marketing expenses); probability of success; the discount rate selected to measure the inherent risk of future cash flows; the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, among other factors.\n\nWe also recorded an intangible asset related to a license and supply agreement with a third party, which was entered into by Immunomedics prior  to  the  acquisition.  Under  the  agreement,  the  third  party  was  granted  an  exclusive  license  to  develop  and commercialize Trodelvy in certain territories in Asia and make certain sales milestones and royalty payments to us. The acquisition date fair value of $175 million was determined by estimating the probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to the outlicense and  a  discount  rate  of  7.0%.  The  discount  rate  represents  the  estimated  rate  that  market  participants  would  use  to  value  this intangible asset. This intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 15 years on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe  inputs  used  for  valuing  these  identifiable  intangibles  are  unobservable  and  considered  Level  3  under  the  fair  value measurement and disclosure guidance.",

Additionally, all outstanding Merck stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) (whether vested or unvested) were converted into adjusted Merck awards for current and former Merck employees or Organon awards for Organon employees (see Note 13).\n\n## 4.    Acquisitions, Research Collaborations and License Agreements\n\nThe  Company  continues  to  pursue  acquisitions  and  the  establishment  of  external  alliances  such  as  research collaborations and licensing agreements to complement its internal research capabilities. These arrangements often include upfront payments, as well as expense reimbursements or payments to the third party, and milestone, royalty or profit share arrangements, contingent  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  future  events  linked  to  the  success  of  the  asset  in  development.  The  Company  also reviews its marketed products and pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing and, as part of its portfolio assessment process, may also divest certain assets. Pro forma financial information for acquired businesses is not presented if the historical financial results of the acquired entity are not significant when compared with the Company's financial results.\n\n## 2021 Transactions\n\nIn November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company, for total consideration of $11.5 billion. Acceleron is evaluating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins that  is  known  to  play  a  central  role  in  the  regulation  of  cell  growth,  differentiation  and  repair.  Acceleron's  lead  therapeutic candidate,  sotatercept  (MK-7962),  has  a  novel  mechanism  of  action  with  the  potential  to  improve  short-term  and/or  long-term clinical outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sotatercept is in Phase 3 trials as an add-on to current standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  PAH.  Under  a  previous  agreement  assumed  by  Merck,  Bristol  Myers  Squibb  (BMS)  was granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize sotatercept outside of the pulmonary hypertension (PH) field (for which Merck would be eligible to receive contingent milestones and royalty payments), however, Merck retains the worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize sotatercept in the PH field. The agreement provides for Merck to pay 22% royalties on future sales of sotatercept in the PH field to BMS.\n\nIn  addition  to  sotatercept, Acceleron's  portfolio  includes Reblozyl (luspatercept),  a  first-in-class  erythroid  maturation recombinant fusion protein that is approved in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood  disorders  and  is  also  being  evaluated  in  Phase  2  and  Phase  3  trials  for  additional  indications  for  hematology  therapies. Reblozyl is  being  developed  and  commercialized  through  a  global  collaboration  with  BMS.  In  connection  with  this  ongoing collaboration, Merck receives a 20% sales royalty from BMS which could increase to a maximum of 24% based on sales levels. This royalty will be reduced by 50% upon the earlier of patent expiry or generic entry on an indication-by-indication basis in each market. Merck is eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments including up to $20 million in regulatory milestones and up to $80 million in sales-based milestones.\n\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The Company incurred $280 million of costs directly related  to  the  acquisition  of Acceleron,  consisting  primarily  of  share-based  compensation  payments  to  settle  non-vested  equity awards attributable to postcombination service, severance, as well as investment banking and legal fees. These costs were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Research and development costs in 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "For the disaggregated revenue amounts contributed by the products listed above as well as the total product sales that include our other approved products, see Note 2. Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nWe also generate revenues from other activities, including royalties for outbound licenses of our intellectual property and other payments received from our collaborations with third-party partners.\n\n## Commercialization and Distribution\n\nWe have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in more than 35 countries. Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party wholesalers, distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial teams promote our products through direct field contact with physicians, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts between the distributor and G ilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the U.S. exclusively through the wholesale channel. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 91% of our product sales in the U.S. and approximately 65% of our total worldwide revenues were from three large wholesalers: Cardinal Health, Inc., Cencora, Inc. and McKesson Corporation, and their specialty distributor affiliates. We sell and distribute our products in Europe and countries outside the U.S. where the product is approved, either through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe operate  in  a  highly  competitive  environment.  Our  products  compete  with  other  commercially  available  products  based  primarily  on  efficacy,  safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease of use, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, distribution and marketing. We also face significant competition from: (i) large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical firms acting either independently or together with other such companies to pursue the development of products and technologies that may be competitive with our existing products or research programs; (ii) academic  institutions,  government  agencies  and  other  public  and  private  organizations  conducting  research  who  may  seek  patent  protection  or  may  establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs; (iii) pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers as our products mature, which often result in a reduction of the net product prices; and (iv) new branded or generic products introduced into major markets, which may impact our ability to maintain pricing and market share.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  'We  face  significant  competition  from  global  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  companies,  specialized pharmaceutical firms and generic drug manufacturers.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur research and development ('R&amp;D') mission is to discover and develop transformational therapies in areas of high unmet medical need.  Our product development efforts are focused primarily on viral diseases, cancer and inflammatory diseases. Our team of research scientists is engaged in the discovery and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to the approval of innovative medicines and therapies that will transform care for people around the world.  We have committed significant resources to internal  R&amp;D opportunities and external business development activity to drive innovation and growth of our business. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of start-up activities in-house. We rely on thirdparty contract research organizations to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management, patient enrollment, ongoing monitoring, site management and bioanalysis.\n\nThe development of product candidates and investigational therapies in our pipeline is subject to various risks and uncertainties that could result in delays or prevent completion of the development and approval of our product candidates. For more information about these risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A. Risk Factors 'We face risks in our clinical trials, including the potential for unfavorable results, delays in anticipated timelines and disruption.' Drug development is inherently risky, and many product candidates and investigational therapies fail during the development process.\n\nIn 2024, we continued to invest in and advance our R&amp;D pipeline across our therapeutic areas. Below is a summary of our product candidates that are in Phase 3 clinical trials or pending marketing authorization review by FDA or European Medicines Agency ('EMA').",

      "question": "What was the impact of the evolving supply relationship between Merck and Organon on financial obligations and supply chain dynamics between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "Merck's supply relationship with Organon for formulated pharmaceutical products underwent a notable shift from 2023 to 2024, impacting financial obligations and supply chain dynamics. In 2023, Merck reported sales under the manufacturing and supply agreements (MSAs) with Organon at $394 million, with related cost of sales at $422 million. By 2024, sales slightly declined to $392 million, while cost of sales improved to $390 million, indicating better cost efficiency in the supply chain. Additionally, the financial obligations between the two companies changed significantly: amounts due from Organon dropped from $632 million in 2023 to $330 million in 2024, while amounts due to Organon decreased more sharply from $598 million to $113 million. This demonstrates a reduction in intercompany receivables and liabilities, suggesting a maturing or winding down of transitional financial arrangements post-spin-off.",

        "Hop 1: MRK(2023) \u2192 Formulated Pharmaceutical Products: Merck supplied formulated pharmaceutical products to Organon under MSAs, with sales of $394 million and cost of sales of $422 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Formulated Pharmaceutical Products \u2192 Organon: The supply relationship was governed by long-term MSAs established during the spin-off, with financial obligations tied to ongoing manufacturing and distribution activities.",
        "Hop 3: Organon \u2190 MRK(2024): In 2024, Merck\u2019s sales to Organon slightly declined to $392 million, while cost of sales improved to $390 million, with a significant drop in intercompany receivables and liabilities ($632M to $330M and $598M to $113M, respectively)."

Upon option exercise, M erck made a payment of $30 million, which was recorded as a charge to Research and development expenses in 2022. A dditionally , M erck made an additional  payment  of  $25  million  upon  technology  transfer  in  2023.  M erck  has  also  made  all  contingent  developmental  milestone  payments  under  the agreement, which aggregated $90 million, nearly all of which were paid in 2024 and were recorded to Research and development expenses. In addition, KelunBiotech is eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments (which include all program compounds) aggregating up to $290 million in first commercial sale milestones, and $780 million in sales-based milestones. The agreement also provides for M erck to pay tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales.\n\n## Spin-Off of Organon &amp; Co.\n\nIn connection with the 2021 spin-off of Organon &amp; Co. (Organon), M erck and Organon entered into a series of interim operating agreements pursuant to which in various jurisdictions where M erck held licenses, permits and other rights in connection with marketing, import and/or distribution of Organon products prior to the separation, M erck continued to market, import and distribute such products on behalf of Organon until such time as the relevant licenses and permits transferred to Organon, with Organon receiving all of the economic benefits and burdens of such activities. A s of December 31, 2024, only one jurisdiction remains under an interim operating agreement. A dditionally , M erck and Organon entered into a number of manufacturing and supply agreements (M SA s) with terms ranging from four years to ten years. The amounts included in the consolidated statement of income for the above M SA s include sales of $392 million, $394 million and $383 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively , and related cost of sales of $390 million, $422 million and $404 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively . The amounts due from Organon under all spin-off related agreements were $330 million and $632 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively , and are reflected in Other current assets . The amounts due to Organon under these agreements were $113 million and $598 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in Accrued and other current liabilities .\n\n## 4.    C ollaborative Arrangements\n\nMerck has entered into collaborative arrangements that provide the Company with varying rights to develop, produce and market products together with its collaborativ e partners. Both parties in these arrangements are active participants and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities of the collaboration. M erck's more significant collaborative arrangements are discussed below.\n\n## AstraZeneca PLC\n\nIn  2017,  M erck  and A straZeneca  PLC  (A straZeneca)  entered  into  a  global  strategic  oncology  collaboration  to  co-develop  and  co-commercialize AstraZeneca's  Lynparza  (olaparib)  for  multiple  cancer  types.  Independently ,  M erck  and  A straZeneca  are  developing  and  commercializing  Lynparza  in combinations  with  their  respective  PD-1  and  PD-L1  medicines, Keytruda and  Imfinzi.  The  companies  are  also  jointly  developing  and  commercializing AstraZeneca's  Koselugo  (selumetinib)  for  multiple  indications.  Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  A straZeneca  and  M erck  share  the  development  and commercialization costs for Lynparza and Koselugo monotherapy and non-PD-1/PD-L1 combination therapy opportunities.\n\nProfits from Lynparza and Koselugo product sales generated through monotherapies or combination therapies are shared equally . A straZeneca is the principal  on  Lynparza  and  Koselugo  sales  transactions.  M erck  records  its  share  of  Lynparza  and  Koselugo  product  sales,  net  of  cost  of  sales  and commercialization costs, as alliance revenue, and its share of development costs associated with the collaboration as part of Research and development expenses. Reimbursements received from A straZeneca for research and development expenses are recognized as reductions to Research and development costs.\n\nAs part of the agreement, M erck made an upfront payment to A straZeneca and also made payments over a multi-year period for certain license options. In addition, the agreement provides for contingent payments from M erck to A straZeneca related to the successful achievement of sales-based and regulatory milestones.\n\nIn 2024, sales of Koselugo triggered a $100 million sales-based milestone payment from M erck to A straZeneca. A ccordingly , M erck recorded a $100 million liability  (which  remained  accrued  at  December  31,  2024  and  was  subsequently  paid  in  January  2025)  and  a  corresponding  increase  to  the intangible asset related to Koselugo. M erck also recognized $48 million of cumulative amortization catch-up expense related to the recognition of this milestone in 2024. Merck made a sales-based milestone payment to AstraZeneca of $400 million in 2022 (which had been previously accrued for). A dditionally , in 2022, M erck determined it was probable that sales of  Lynparza in the future would trigger a $600 million sales-based milestone payment from  M erck to A straZeneca. Accordingly, M erck recorded a $600 million liability (which remained accrued at December 31, 2024 and was",

      "question": "How did Bristol-Myers Squibb's reliance on Sanofi-owned trademarks change between 2022 and 2024, specifically regarding the presence of Avapro/Avalide in 2022 versus its absence in 2024 and the continued mention of Plavix in both years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb listed Avapro/Avalide and Plavix as Sanofi-owned trademarks that the company referenced in its product portfolio. By 2024, Avapro/Avalide was no longer listed, while Plavix remained noted as a Sanofi trademark. This suggests a reduced reliance on Sanofi's Avapro/Avalide brand, potentially due to product lifecycle changes such as generic transition or internal rebranding, while the continued presence of Plavix indicates ongoing dependency on Sanofi for at least one key product. The change reflects a strategic shift in brand portfolio management, with a narrowing of externally trademarked dependencies.",

      "answer": "CVS maintained its 50% ownership in Red Oak Sourcing, LLC with Cardinal Health in both 2023 and 2024. Cardinal continued to make quarterly payments to CVS, which totaled $183 million in both years. These payments reduced CVS's carrying value of inventory and were recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory was sold. As a result, the cost structure remained stable between the years, with no significant change in the financial benefit derived from the Red Oak joint venture.",

        "Hop 1: CVS(2023) \u2192 Red Oak Sourcing, LLC: CVS owns 50% of Red Oak and consolidates it as the primary beneficiary, receiving $183 million quarterly from Cardinal.",

          "chunk_text": "consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year or years in which the differences are ex pected to reverse. The effect of a change in the tax  rates on deferred tax  assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such change.\n\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and the Company's recent operating results. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax  asset will be recovered.\n\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax  positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\n\nInterest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax  positions are recognized in the income tax  provision.\n\n## Measurement of Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans ('pension plans') and other postretirement employee benefit plans ('OPEB plans') for its employees and retirees. The Company recognizes the funded status of its pension and OPEB plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on the year-end measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations. When the fair value of plan assets are in ex cess of the plan benefit obligations, the amounts are reported in other current assets and other assets. When the fair value of plan benefit obligations are in ex cess of plan assets, the amounts are reported in accrued ex penses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities based on the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets. The net periodic benefit income for the Company's pension and OPEB plans do not contain a service cost component as these plans have been frozen for an extended period of time. Non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nEarnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method. The Company calculates basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. See Note 16 ''Earnings Per Share'' for additional information.\n\n## Shares Held in Trust\n\nThe Company maintains grantor trusts, which held approximately one million shares of its common stock at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. These shares are designated for use under various employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## VIEs\n\nThe Company has various investments that are considered VIEs. The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it may voluntarily contribute funds. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers several factors, including whether the Company has (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the V IE.\n\n## VIEs - Primary Beneficiary\n\n## Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ('Red Oak')\n\nIn 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ('Cardinal') established Red Oak, a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own 50%. The Red Oak arrangement had an initial term of ten years. In 2021, the Red Oak arrangement was amended to extend the initial term an additional five years, for a total term of 15 years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own",

      "question": "How did Pfizer's 2023 challenges with biosimilar competition influence its 2024 collaboration strategies with payors, particularly in light of increased state-level Medicaid rebate negotiations and payor-driven cost containment efforts?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Pfizer identified biosimilars as a key competitive threat, noting that payors were increasingly promoting biosimilars to reduce healthcare costs. This pressure was compounded in 2024 when Pfizer began reclassifying royalty revenues and emphasized a strategic shift toward collaborating with payors to improve patient access and affordability. During this time, states intensified Medicaid rebate negotiations, pushing for deeper supplemental rebates and formulary restrictions. Pfizer's 2024 strategy reflects a response to these pressures by aligning more closely with payors to manage utilization and maintain market access, particularly for high-value biopharma products.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PFE(2023) \u2192 Biosimilars: Pfizer identified biosimilars as a growing competitive threat that impacted its ability to maintain pricing and market share, particularly in a landscape of increasing healthcare cost containment.",
        "Hop 2: Biosimilars \u2192 Payors: Payors actively promoted biosimilars as part of broader cost-control strategies, especially within Medicaid programs where states sought to reduce pharmaceutical expenditures through preferred drug lists and supplemental rebate agreements.",
        "Hop 3: Payors \u2190 PFE(2024): In response, Pfizer shifted toward deeper collaboration with payors in 2024, aiming to align commercial strategies with payor priorities around affordability and access, while also adapting to new revenue classifications and operational efficiency goals."

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## GENERAL\n\nThe following M D &amp;A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the am ounts and certainty of cash flows from  operations and from  outside sources, and is provided as a supplem ent to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statem ents and related notes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this F orm  10-K. D iscussions of 2022 item s and year-to-year com parisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this F orm  10-K can be found within M D &amp;A in our 2023 F orm  10-K.\n\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the im pact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can m ask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful inform ation to evaluate our results.\n\nI n the first quarter of 2024, we reclassified royalty incom e (substantially all of which is related to our Biopharm a segm ent) from Other (income)/deductions--net and began presenting Royalty revenues as a separate line item  within Total revenues in our consolidated statem ents of operations. P rior-period am ounts have been recast to conform  to the current presentation.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEG Y AND OUTLOOK\n\nFinancial Highlights --The following is a sum m ary of certain financial perform ance m etrics (in billions, except per share data):\n\n- ** For additional information regarding Adjusted diluted EPS (w hich is a non-GAAP financial measure), including reconciliations of certain GAAP Reported to non- GAAP Adjusted information, see the NonGAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Incom e section w ithin M D&amp;A.\n\nOur Business and Strategy --Pfizer I nc. is a research-based, global biopharm aceutical com pany. W e apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly im prove their lives. See the Item 1. Business--About Pfizer section. As a science-driven global biopharm aceutical com pany, we rem ain focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting our m arketed brands and deploying capital responsibly, with a focus on initiatives that can help contribute to our long-term  revenue and future growth. M ost of our revenues com e from  the m anufacture and sale of biopharm aceutical products. W e believe that our m edicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare providers and patients, and we continuously evaluate how we can best collaborate with patients, physicians and payors to support and expand patient access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. In addition, we continually seek to expand and broaden our product portfolio offerings through prioritized developm ent of our pipeline and business developm ent opportunities targeted at critical unm et patient needs. As a result, our com m ercial organizational structure and R &amp;D  operations are critical to the successful execution of our business strategy. O ur ability to fulfill our purpose, Breakthroughs that change patients' lives , rem ains a core focus and underscores our com m itm ent to addressing the needs of society to help sustain long-term  value creation for all stakeholders.\n\nOur 2025 key priorities are:\n\n1. Improve R&amp;D productivity w ith sharpened focus\n2. Expand margins and maximize operational efficiency\n3. Achieve commercial excellence in our key categories\n4. Optimize capital allocation.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n28",

      "question": "How did Amgen's strategic development of AMJEVITA as a biosimilar to HUMIRA in 2022 influence its competitive positioning against HUMIRA in 2024, particularly in light of the phase 3 study initiation and the continued presence of HUMIRA as a key competitor in the U.S. and Europe?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen initiated a phase 3 study for AMJEVITA, a biosimilar to HUMIRA, signaling a strategic move to enter the TNF-alpha inhibitor market dominated by AbbVie\u2019s HUMIRA. By 2024, despite AMJEVITA not yet being marketed, HUMIRA remained a direct competitor to Amgen\u2019s other products like Repatha and Otezla in the U.S. and Europe, indicating that Amgen had not yet displaced HUMIRA in key therapeutic areas. The continued listing of HUMIRA as a competitor in 2024 suggests that AMJEVITA had not yet reached commercialization or had limited market penetration, highlighting a gap between clinical development progress and competitive impact.",

      "question": "How did the implementation of Medicare-related pricing provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act impact Amgen's exposure to pricing pressures in 2024 compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Amgen reported significant pricing pressures due to macroeconomic conditions, healthcare cost containment measures, and the IRA\u2019s anticipated impact on drug pricing in Medicare Part B and D. By 2024, the IRA\u2019s provisions began to take effect, including the government's ability to set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics starting as early as nine or thirteen years post-FDA approval. This led to a more direct and structured pricing constraint on Amgen\u2019s products, particularly as the law also redesigned the Part D benefit and introduced penalties for price increases above inflation. The evolution of these regulatory pressures under Medicare shows a shift from anticipated risk in 2023 to a more concrete and binding pricing framework in 2024, increasing Amgen\u2019s exposure to pricing pressures through regulatory mandates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN(2023) \u2192 Pricing Pressures: AMGN cited increasing pricing pressures in its 2023 10-K, including from macroeconomic conditions and the IRA\u2019s expected effects on Medicare pricing.",
        "Hop 2: Pricing Pressures \u2192 Medicare: The IRA introduced structured Medicare pricing mechanisms, such as mandatory price setting for certain drugs starting in 2026 and Part D redesign, as detailed in ABBV\u2019s 2024 10-K.",
        "Hop 3: Medicare \u2190 AMGN(2024): AMGN\u2019s 2024 10-K reflects the concrete impact of IRA provisions, including price-setting mechanisms and inflation penalties, which began to constrain its pricing flexibility under Medicare."

          "chunk_text": "Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.\n\nAbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\nCost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business-Regulation-Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing.\" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, European Union member states and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future.\n\nAbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, as well as federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, contribute to pricing pressures. In particular, the IRA will have the effect of reducing prices and reimbursements for certain of our products, which could significantly impact AbbVie's results of operations. Under the IRA, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services can effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices can apply as soon as nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. In August 2023, HHS, through the CMS, selected Imbruvica as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. In August 2024, the CMS published Medicare Part D prices that will be applicable to these medicines, including Imbruvica, beginning January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS, through the CMS, selected Vraylar and Linzess as two of the 15 medicines subject to government-set prices in Medicare Part D beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. In addition, beginning in January 2025, under the IRA, the 70% coverage gap discount program was replaced by a 10% manufacturer discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and i ncurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20% discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold under the new Part D benefit redesign. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. The IRA has and will continue to meaningfully impact AbbVie's business strategies and those of others in the pharmaceutical i ndustry. The full impact of the IRA on AbbVie's business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of our or a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nAbbVie continues to evaluate the impact that the IRA may have on the company. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries may result in additional pricing pressures.\n\nIn major markets worldwide, governments play a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries' pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in revenues and operating earnings.\n\nRebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

          "chunk_text": "- Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sales of our products.\n\n## Risks Related to Operations\n\n- We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.\n- We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\n- Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n- Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives.\n- The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations.\n\n## General Risk Factors\n\n- Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\n- Our stock price is volatile.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THIRD-PARTY POLICIES\n\nOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.\n\nSales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. G overnments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs. Further, pressures on healthcare budgets from the economic downturn and inflation continue and are likely to increase, across the markets we serve. Payers are increasingly focused on costs, which has resulted,  and  is  ex pected  to  continue  to  result,  in  lower  reimbursement  rates  for  our  products  and/or  narrower  patient  populations  for  which  payers  will  reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, have limited, and are likely to continue to limit, our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which can have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, particularly over the past few years, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced and/or signed into law to lower drug prices. These include the IRA law that enables the U.S. government to set prices for certain drugs in Medicare, redesigns Medicare Part D benefits to shift a greater proportion of the costs to manufacturers and health plans, and enables the U.S. government to impose penalties if drug prices are increased at a rate faster than inflation (IRA Inflation Penalties). Additional proposals focused on drug pricing continue to be debated, and additional executive orders or regulatory initiatives focused on drug pricing and competition are likely to be adopted and implemented in some form. It is unclear what policies the new Administration will advance with respect to IRA implementation and other drug pricing proposals.  Further,  state  government  activity  has  been  dynamic,  including  certain  states  enacting  new  laws  limiting  drug  reimbursement  under  state  run  Medicaid programs and prohibiting restrictions on 340B Program use. Such state laws could also eventually be adopted at the federal level.\n\nWe are unable to predict which or how many policy, regulatory, administrative or legislative changes may ultimately be, or effectively estimate the consequences to our business if, enacted and implemented. However, to the extent that payer actions further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing of or otherwise reduce the use of our products, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n-Changing U.S. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, access to, pricing of, and sales of our products\n\nA substantial proportion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Reimbursement. Our business has been, and will continue to be, affected by legislative actions changing U.S. federal reimbursement policy. For example, the IRA includes provisions requiring that, beginning in 2026, mandatory price setting be introduced in Medicare for certain drugs paid for under Parts B and D, whereby manufacturers must accept a price established by the government or face penalties on all U.S. sales (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20 in 2029 and subsequent",

      "question": "How did LLY's liquidity strategy in 2022 account for the eight-year Toll Tax payment schedule introduced by the 2017 Tax Act, and how did this translate into specific cash outflows related to the Toll Tax in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LLY acknowledged that the 2017 Tax Act would require capitalizing and amortizing R&D expenses, which was expected to increase cash payments for income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and moderately reduce them over the following five years. This highlighted LLY's awareness of the Act's impact on cash flow planning. The Act also introduced an eight-year payment period for the one-time Toll Tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, allowing payments from 2018 through 2025. By 2023, LLY was complying with this schedule, with specific future cash payments related to the Toll Tax outlined in the 2023 10-K. This shows that LLY's 2022 liquidity planning anticipated the long-term cash obligations under the Act, and in 2023, the company was actively managing its cash flows in accordance with the structured eight-year payment plan.",

As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See \"Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters\" for additional information.\n\nWe plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021, compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen positioned Repatha as a PCSK9 inhibitor indicated to reduce cardiovascular risks in adults with established CVD and to lower LDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia, including HeFH and HoFH. By 2024, payers had increasingly imposed utilization criteria, such as prior authorization and step therapy, which limited patient access to Repatha despite its clinical indications. In response, Amgen introduced new National Drug Codes (NDCs) to make Repatha available at a lower list price, aiming to reduce prescription abandonment driven by high patient co-pays, especially among Medicare beneficiaries. This reflects a strategic shift from product positioning in 2022 to access-focused pricing adjustments in 2024, influenced by payer resistance and the need to improve patient affordability.",

Louisiana, Arkansas, West V irginia, Minnesota, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Maryland have enacted laws with mandates on manufacturers participating in the 340B Program, and, in 2024, no fewer than 25 states considered similar legislation. These bills vary, but typically include provisions on restricting a manufacturer's ability to direct drugs in 340B channels, recognizing 340B contract  pharmacies and a prohibition on requiring the inclusion of 340B claims modifiers.  In  March 2024, the  U.S.  Court of Appeals for the 8th  Circuit ruled that Arkansas' Act 1103, which prohibits drugmakers from restricting the acquisition or delivery of 340B drugs to covered entities and their contract pharmacies, was not preempted by the federal 340B statute. The decision contributed to an increase in the number of states considering similar legislation. In July 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi denied motions for a preliminary injunction in two cases challenging a similar law in Mississippi, finding that neither plaintiff had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. These orders are being appealed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. In September 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana dismissed a lawsuit challenging Louisiana's 340B contract pharmacy mandate law, and the U.S. District Court for the  District of  Maryland denied a motion for preliminary injunction challenging a similar law in Maryland. These lawsuits challenging states on their 340B contract pharmacy laws are subsequent to Genesis Health Care, Inc. v. Becerra, where the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina issued an order in November 2023 that enjoins the Health Resources and Services Administration from enforcing its more restrictive interpretation of who is considered a patient under the 340B Program, to the potential benefit of healthcare systems seeking to expand the application of 340B discounts.\n\nAdditionally, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida to move forward with its importation program proposal, though the state has not completed any significant steps towards importation within the one-year authorization window. Colorado, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and V ermont have also enacted state importation laws, and some have submitted plans for approval to the FDA. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs.\n\nUltimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n\n## -U.S. commercial payer actions have affected, and may continue to affect, access to and sales of our products\n\nPayers, including healthcare insurers,  PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from consolidations of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, are continuing to seek ways to further reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients' use of manufacturer commercial co-pay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. Payers, including PBMs, have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, and to also impose restrictions on access to, or usage of, our products (such as Step Therapy), require that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product, and/or chosen to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet their utilization criteria, and these requirements have served to limit patient access to Repatha treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers (including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans), and in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than paying their co-pay, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list  price.  However,  affordability  of  patient  out-of-pocket  co-pay  cost  has  limited,  and  may  continue  to  limit,  patient  use.  Further,  despite  these  net  and  list  price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and may seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions, such as changing formulary coverage for Repatha, that could reduce its sales. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, negatively affecting Repatha sales.\n\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in  the  United  States,  the  FTC's  interim  report  released  in  2024  showed  that  the  top  six   integrated  health  plans  and  PBMs  controlled  about  94%  of  all  pharmacy prescriptions. This high degree of consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mailorder pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers from our business. Each of CVS, Express Scripts and United Health G roup (among the top six integrated health plans and PBMs) have Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their leverage to negotiate deeper discounts on their behalf and for the benefit of their other customers. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage changes, plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse",

Also under the IRA, starting on January 1, 2024, Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning on January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance will become reduced in the catastrophic phase (resulting in a shift and increase of such costs to Part D plans and manufacturers, including by requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs). Further, the IRA created a mechanism for CMS to collect rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation. We began to accrue for rebate obligations on October 1, 2022 for Medicare Part D and on January 1, 2023 for Medicare Part B.\n\nOther potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; increasing transparency in drug pricing; using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices; referencing foreign prices; and changes to government rebate programs. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida to move forward with its importation program proposal, which excludes biologics. CMS also issued a proposed Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rule that would have required manufacturers to aggregate or 'stack' all rebates, discounts or other price concessions made to separate, unrelated entities across the pharmaceutical supply chain on a given unit of product to determine the 'Best Price,' a metric that is used to determine Medicaid rebates and 340B statutory rates. This proposal was not finalized but remains a policy that could be reconsidered in the future. Further, at the state level, eight states (Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish PDABs to identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and in four states (Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington) include authority for the state PDAB to set upper payment limits on certain drugs for in-state patients, payers and providers.\n\nIn  many  countries  other  than  the  United  States,  government-sponsored  healthcare  systems  are  the  primary  payers  for  drugs  and  biologics.  With  increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in rebates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many governments use health technology assessment organizations to judge the added benefit of new treatments over existing ones, metrics which are then used to set reimbursement prices and/or set coverage limits. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that governments will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The EU is currently undergoing a review and revision of its pharmaceutical legislation. Various proposals are under consideration with the EU Council, followed by a negotiation among the EU government to agree to a final law. Full implementation is not expected until 2027 or later. The new legislation, if implemented, will likely have a significant impact on the landscape for access and pricing decisions within EU Member States.\n\nThe dynamics and developments discussed above create pressures on the pricing and potential usage of our products and on the industry. G iven the diverse interests  in  play  between  payers,  biopharmaceutical  manufacturers,  policy  makers,  healthcare  providers  and  independent  organizations,  if  and  whether  the  parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:\n\n- investing billions of dollars annually in R&amp;D;\n- pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;\n- developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;\n- partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;\n- providing patient support and education programs;\n- helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and\n- working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and in which patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.\n\nSee  Item  1A.  Risk  FactorsOur  sales  depend  on  coverage  and  reimbursement  from  government  and  commercial  third-party  payers,  and  pricing  and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability and Item 1A.

      "question": "How did the growth in Merck's sales of Adempas in its own marketing territories from 2022 to 2023 reflect the evolving dynamics of its collaboration with Bayer AG, particularly in terms of profit-sharing and demand trends?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck reported that sales of Adempas in its marketing territories grew by 14%, primarily driven by higher demand in Europe. This growth occurred under the joint development and commercialization agreement with Bayer, where Merck commercializes Adempas outside the Americas. By 2023, this growth rate had slowed to 7%, still reflecting increased demand but at a more moderate pace. During the same period, alliance revenue from the collaboration grew 8% in 2023, indicating stronger performance in profit-sharing from Bayer's territories. This suggests that while Merck's direct sales growth of Adempas slowed slightly, the overall collaboration with Bayer AG became more profitable, likely due to expanded market penetration in Bayer's regions or improved cost-sharing dynamics.",

The  two  companies  have implemented a joint development and commercialization strategy.

Under  the agreement, Bayer commercializes Adempas in the Americas, while Merck commercializes in the rest of the world. For Verquvo, Merck commercializes in the U.S. and Bayer commercializes in the rest of the world. Both companies share in development costs and profits on sales. Merck records sales of Adempas and Verquvo in its marketing territories, as well as alliance revenue. Alliance revenue represents Merck's share of profits from sales of Adempas and Verquvo in Bayer's marketing territories, which are product sales  net  of  cost  of  sales  and  commercialization  costs.  Cost  of  sales  includes  Bayer's  share  of  profits  from  sales  in  Merck's marketing territories.\n\nIn addition, the agreement provided for contingent payments from Merck to Bayer related to the successful achievement of sales-based milestones. Merck made a sales-based milestone payment to Bayer of $375 million in 2020. In 2021, following the approval of Verquvo noted above, Merck determined it was probable that sales of Adempas and Verquvo in the future would trigger the remaining $400 million sales-based milestone",

      "answer": "In 2023, Merck introduced MK-1654 (clesrovimab), a human monoclonal antibody for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as part of its diversified pipeline. By 2024, the company disclosed that MK-1654 was subject to U.S. patent law with an anticipated expiration date of 2036. This indicates a strategic move to secure long-term intellectual property protection for MK-1654, aligning with Merck's broader focus on extending patent coverage for key pipeline assets such as MK-1022 (patritumab deruxtecan), which has a U.S. patent expiration in 2035.

      "answer": "In 2023, LLY significantly increased capital expenditures to $3.45 billion\u2014nearly double the $1.85 billion spent in 2022\u2014to support new manufacturing facilities in Indiana, North Carolina, Germany, and Ireland. Despite this aggressive investment in long-term infrastructure, the company maintained its cash holdings primarily with G-SIBs in 2024, indicating a continued reliance on major financial institutions that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and capital adequacy requirements. This dual approach reflects a strategic balance: LLY is deploying capital to expand production capacity and support future product pipelines, while also maintaining liquidity discipline by entrusting its cash with systemically important banks that are closely monitored for financial stability. The company explicitly notes its ongoing monitoring of exposures to these institutions, reinforcing a risk-aware posture that aligns with its broader liquidity risk management practices.",

      "question": "How did the expiration of compound patents in 2022 affect MRK's market exclusivity strategy for key pharmaceutical products, and how did this evolve into active patent litigation defense efforts by 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MRK acknowledged that the expiration of compound patents could lead to a loss of market exclusivity for key pharmaceutical products, though they noted potential extensions through pediatric exclusivity (up to 6 months) or data protection (5 years for new chemical entities, 7 years for orphan drugs, and 12 years for biologicals). This regulatory and patent landscape shaped their exclusivity strategy. By 2023, MRK actively defended its patent rights, particularly in cases like Bridion, where they filed multiple lawsuits under the Hatch-Waxman Act against generic manufacturers. These legal actions were a direct response to the impending expiration of key patents and aimed to preserve market exclusivity beyond the initial patent term, reflecting a strategic shift from regulatory reliance to litigation-based defense of intellectual property.",

          "chunk_text": "\nReceived Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA for the treatment of high-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. (1)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the patents in the above charts are compound patents. Each patent may be subject to a future patent term restoration of up to five years and six month pediatric market exclusivity, either or both of which may be available. In addition, depending on the circumstances surrounding any final regulatory approval of the compound, there may be other listed patents  or  patent  applications  pending  that  could  have  relevance  to  the  product  as  finally  approved;  the  relevance  of  any  such application would depend upon the claims that ultimately may be granted and the nature of the final regulatory approval of the product. Also, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data is complementary to patent protection and, in some cases, may provide more effective or longer lasting marketing exclusivity than a compound's patent estate. In the U.S., the data protection generally  runs  five  years  from  first  marketing  approval  of  a  new  chemical  entity,  extended  to  seven  years  for  an  orphan  drug indication and 12 years from first marketing approval of a biological product.\n\nWhile  the  expiration  of  a  compound  patent  normally  results  in  a  loss  of  market  exclusivity  for  the  covered pharmaceutical  product,  commercial  benefits  may  continue  to  be  derived  from:  (i)  later-expiring  patents  on  processes  and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii) patents relating to the  use  of  such  product;  (iii)  patents  relating  to  novel  compositions  and  formulations;  and  (iv)  in  the  U.S.  and  certain  other countries, market exclusivity that may be available under relevant law. The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the  market,  the  complexities  and  economics  of  the  process  for  manufacture  of  the  active  ingredient  of  the  product  and  the requirements  of  new  drug  provisions  of  the  Federal  Food,  Drug  and  Cosmetic  Act  or  similar  laws  and  regulations  in  other countries.\n\nAdditions to  market  exclusivity  are  sought  in  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  through  all  relevant  laws,  including  laws increasing patent life. Some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by an increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products. Additionally, improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the U.S. and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties.\n\nFor  further  information  with  respect  to  the  Company's  patents,  see  Item  1A.  'Risk  Factors'  and  Item  8.  'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' Note 11.

          "chunk_text": "\nWe own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries primarily covering our products. We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which  the  product  has  market  exclusivity. A  product's  market  exclusivity  is  generally  determined  by  two  forms  of  intellectual property:  patent  rights  held  by  the  innovator  company  and  any  regulatory  forms  of  exclusivity  to  which  the  innovative  drug  is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to  exclude  others  from  practicing  an  invention  related  to  the  medicine.  Patents  may  cover,  among  other  things,  the  active ingredient(s),  various  uses  of  a  drug  product,  pharmaceutical  formulations,  drug  delivery  mechanisms  and  processes  for  (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory data protection exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, in the U.S., EU, Japan and certain other countries, RDP exclusivity rights are offered as incentives for research on medicines for rare diseases, or orphan drugs, and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. These incentives can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.",

      "question": "How did the performance of Abiomed's Impella RP product in 2023 influence the strategic value of the acquisition as evaluated in 2024, particularly in relation to the commercial and clinical milestones tied to the contingent value rights (CVRs)?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Abiomed's Impella RP was highlighted as a key growth driver within the Interventional Solutions franchise, contributing to a 47.7% year-over-year sales increase, which included strong adoption of Impella RP and Impella 5.5. This early commercial success supported the strategic rationale for the acquisition. By 2024, the continued strength of Impella RP across all major commercialized regions reinforced Abiomed's integration into JNJ's Cardiovascular franchise, which grew 21.4% year-over-year. The performance of Impella RP directly influenced the likelihood of achieving the CVR milestones, particularly the $7.50 per share contingent payment tied to FDA approval for use in STEMI patients without cardiogenic shock by 2028. The sustained momentum of Impella RP in 2023 and 2024 suggests that JNJ's acquisition is on track to unlock the full commercial and clinical potential embedded in the CVR structure.",

The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. A cquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal y ear 2024 were not material.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business combination.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $17.7 billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (A biomed). The remaining acquisitions were not material.\n\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of cardiovascular medical technology with a firstin-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and heart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens the Company's position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and recovery, one of healthcare's largest areas of unmet need. The results of operations were included in the M edTech segment as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the acquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $380.00 per share in cash, amounting to $17.1 billion, net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right ('CV R') entitling the holder to receive up to $35.00 per share in cash (which with respect to the CV Rs total approximately $1.6 billion in the aggregate) if certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into account the CV Rs) of approximately $16.5 billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired.\n\n## The milestones of the CVR consist of:\n\n- a. $17.50 per share, payable if net sales for A biomed products exceeds $3.7 billion during Johnson &amp; Johnson's fiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this period and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson &amp; Johnson's fiscal first quarter of 2029, $8.75 per share;\n- b. $7.50 per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella\u00ae products in ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEM I) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\n- c. $10.00 per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella\u00ae products in high risk PCI or STEM I with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical endpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\n\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In fiscal 2023, there were purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $0.2 billion with an offsetting increase to goodwill. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $20.1 billion (net of $0.3 billion cash acquired), primarily to goodwill for $11.1 billion, amortizable intangible assets for $6.6 billion, IPR&amp;D for $1.1 billion, marketable securities of $0.6 billion and liabilities assumed of $3.0 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent consideration mentioned above for $0.7 billion and deferred taxes of $2.0 billion. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities and adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2024 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella\u00ae platform with an average weighted life of 14 years. The IPR&amp;D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&amp;D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied was 9.5%.\n\nIn the fiscal y ears 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.3 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, which was primarily recorded in Other (income)/expense.\n\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal y ears 2024, 2023 and 2022 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.\n\n92",

Additionally, Amgen maintained its equity stake in BeiGene in 2024 through multiple amendments to the Share Purchase Agreement, ensuring continued influence and shared profit dynamics.

          "chunk_text": "## UCB\n\nWe are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of EVENITY . Under our collaboration, UCB has rights to lead commercialization for EVENITY in most countries in Europe. Amgen, as the principal, leads commercialization for EVENITY  and recognizes product sales in all other territories, including the United States. G lobal development costs and commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration are shared equally. Amgen manufactures and supplies EVENITY worldwide.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, global profit and loss share expenses were $547 million, $396 million and $255 million, respectively, and were recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net costs recovered from and due to UCB during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were not material.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nIn January 2020, we acquired an equity stake in BeiG ene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. For  additional  information  regarding  our  equity  investment  in  BeiG ene,  see  Note  10,  Investments.  Under  the  collaboration,  BeiG ene  began  selling  XG EV A  in  2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen would pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China of such products for a specified period. Amgen manufactures and supplies the collaboration products to BeiGene.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiG ene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash and development services of up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiG ene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiG ene will share profits and losses equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen also pays royalties to BeiGene.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net costs recovered from BeiG ene for oncology product candidates were $122 million, $109 million and $199 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, product sales from Amgen to BeiG ene under the collaboration were $259 million, $125 million and $64 million, respectively, and were recorded in Product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Profit and loss share expenses related to the initial product-specific commercialization period were not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.\n\nWe are in a collaboration and licensing agreement with Kyowa Kirin to jointly develop and commercialize rocatinlimab, an anti-OX40 fully human monoclonal antibody, worldwide, except in Japan. Rocatinlimab is for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, with potential for treatment of other autoimmune diseases.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we lead the global development, manufacture and commercialization of rocatinlimab, except in Japan. Kyowa Kirin will co-promote rocatinlimab with Amgen in the United States and have opt in rights to co-promote rocatinlimab in various other markets outside the United States, including in Europe and Asia.\n\nWe made an upfront payment of $400 million to Kyowa Kirin that was recognized in R&amp;D expense in the third quarter of 2021. Amgen and Kyowa Kirin share equally the global development costs, except in Japan, and the U.S. commercialization costs. Outside the United States and Japan, any commercialization costs incurred by Kyowa Kirin will be reimbursed by Amgen. We may also be required to make milestone payments of up to $850 million contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory events and commercial thresholds. We will also pay Kyowa Kirin significant double-digit royalties on global sales, except in Japan. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net costs recovered from Kyowa Kirin were $166 million, $93 million and $23 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Other\n\nIn addition to the collaborations discussed above, we have various other collaborations that are not individually significant to our business at this time. Pursuant to the terms of those agreements, we may be required to pay additional amounts, or we may receive additional amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones that in the aggregate could be significant. We may also incur or have reimbursed to us significant R&amp;D costs if a related product candidate were to advance to late-stage clinical trials. In addition, if any products related to these collaborations are approved for sale, we may be required to pay significant royalties, or we may receive significant royalties on future sales. The payments of these amounts, however, are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events that have high degrees of uncertainty of occurrence.",

      "question": "How did the 2024 EU regulatory changes proposing shorter orphan drug exclusivity periods affect AMGN's strategic positioning of its biologics portfolio compared to 2023, particularly in light of the 12-year exclusivity framework under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMGN's biologics portfolio was supported by a robust regulatory framework including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which granted 12 years of exclusivity for innovator biologics and allowed for additional orphan drug exclusivity. This regulatory environment supported AMGN's strategic investment and positioning of its biologics pipeline. However, in 2024, the EU's proposed revisions to its pharmaceutical legislation threatened to shorten orphan drug exclusivity periods, creating uncertainty in international markets. This regulatory shift likely prompted AMGN to reassess its biologics portfolio strategy, particularly for products targeting small-population indications, as shorter exclusivity periods could reduce market protection and revenue potential in Europe, where the company had previously faced challenges with reimbursement and market access.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN(2023) \u2192 Biologics: AMGN's business model was heavily reliant on biologics, which are governed by specific regulatory protections including the 12-year exclusivity period under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.",
        "Hop 2: Biologics \u2192 Orphan Drug Exclusivity: Biologics may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity under U.S. and EU regulatory frameworks, providing an additional 7 years of exclusivity for products treating rare diseases.",
        "Hop 3: Orphan Drug Exclusivity \u2190 AMGN(2024): In 2024, AMGN acknowledged that the EU's proposed changes to pharmaceutical legislation\u2014expected to be implemented by 2027\u2014could reduce orphan drug exclusivity periods, directly impacting the company's strategic positioning of its biologics portfolio in international markets."

          "chunk_text": "effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Policy reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For example, in September 2024, the FTC brought  action  against  the  three  largest  PBMs  alleging  anticompetitive  and  unfair  rebating  practices.  In  addition,  multiple  Congressional  Committees  have  been investigating PBM practices and have also proposed legislation that could increase transparency and reporting of these practices and/or impact rebates and service fees. The results of such inquiries could have an effect on manufacturer interactions with PBMs, resulting in changes to access for certain medicines. See Concentration of sales  at  certain  of  our  wholesaler  distributors,  and  consolidation  of  private  payers,  such  as  insurers,  and  PBMs  has  negatively  affected,  and  may  continue  to negatively affect, our business.\n\nOur business is also affected by policies implemented by private healthcare entities that process Medicare claims, including Medicare Administrative Contractors. For  ex ample,  in  2022,  several  Medicare Administrative  Contractors  issued  notice  that  TEZSPIRE  would  be  added  to  their  'self-administered  drug'  ex clusion  lists. Although the Medicare Administrative Contractors subsequently removed TEZSPIRE from their exclusion lists, these exclusions, if reintroduced and/or implemented, would result in Medicare beneficiaries with severe asthma losing access to TEZSPIRE coverage under Medicare Part B and potentially also under Medicare Advantage.\n\n## -Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products\n\nOutside the United States, we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures and to reduce intellectual property protections. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Reimbursement. Pressures to decrease drug expenditures may intensify as governments take actions to address budgets strained by high inflation and weak economic conditions, including in Europe where the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have challenged the economies in that region. Further, the EU is currently undergoing a review and revision of its general pharmaceutical legislation that, while full implementation is not ex pected before 2027, has led to proposals that  would  reduce  intellectual  property  protection  for  new  products  (including  potentially  shortening  the  duration  of  regulatory  data  ex clusivity  and  orphan  drug exclusivity protections), as well as change the reimbursement and regulatory landscape. International reference pricing has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs. International reference pricing policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures or affordability across countries or regions. Other expenditure control practices, including the use of revenue clawbacks, rebates and caps on product sales, are also used in various foreign jurisdictions. In addition, countries may refuse to reimburse, or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product, when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA's approval of Repatha for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, prior to 2020, the reimbursement of Repatha in France was limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)) following a national health technology assessment. Many countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most, or all of, the sales in that country or region. Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their ex isting coverage and reimbursement, or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to hospitals and other providers, has negatively affected, and may further negatively affect, the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them. Such failures and changes have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\n\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Professional societies, practice management groups, insurance  carriers,  physicians'  groups,  private  health  and  science  foundations  and  organizations  involved  in  various  diseases  also  publish  guidelines  and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. V alue assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products' reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations.  In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, costeffectiveness and service effects of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations have recommended, and may  in  the  future  recommend,  reimbursement  for  certain  of  our  products  for  a  narrower  indication  than  was  approved  by  applicable  regulatory  agencies  or  may recommend against reimbursement entirely.

      "question": "How did the expiration timeline for AMGN's Prolia/XGEVA patents in 2023 and 2024 affect the company's competitive positioning in the U.S. and European markets, particularly in light of the 2022 expiration of the European patent and the upcoming 2025 U.S. patent expiration?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMGN faced increasing regulatory and competitive risks due to the uncertainty around patent protection for its products, including Prolia/XGEVA, as outlined in the 10-K filing. This concern was directly tied to the expiration of the European patent for Prolia/XGEVA in June 2022, which left the product exposed to biosimilar competition in that market. In 2024, the U.S. patent for Prolia/XGEVA was still active, with an expiration date of February 2025, giving AMGN a limited window to reinforce its market position before facing domestic biosimilar threats. The narrowing patent protection timeline\u2014especially the proximity of the 2025 U.S. expiration\u2014likely intensified AMGN's strategic focus on lifecycle management and market retention efforts for Prolia/XGEVA in both regions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN(2023) \u2192 Patent Protection: AMGN expressed concerns about the weakening of patent protections and the increasing risk of biosimilar competition, especially in light of recent global trends and litigation risks.",
        "Hop 2: Patent Protection \u2192 Prolia/XGEVA: The 2024 patent expiration table revealed that Prolia/XGEVA\u2019s European patent had already expired in June 2022, while its U.S. patent was set to expire in February 2025.",
        "Hop 3: Prolia/XGEVA \u2190 AMGN(2024): AMGN continued to produce and market Prolia/XGEVA in 2024, but with the U.S. patent nearing expiration, the company faced imminent biosimilar threats that could erode its market share."

      "answer": "In 2022, MDT reported $125 million in mutual funds, all valued using Level 1 inputs, indicating a full reliance on quoted market prices. By 2024, the mutual fund holding decreased slightly to $114 million, still entirely based on Level 1 inputs. However, the overall short-term investment value increased from $73 million in 2022 to $114 million in 2024, suggesting a strategic shift toward maintaining a larger liquid position while preserving the same valuation methodology. This shows MDT maintained transparency in valuation but adjusted the scale of short-term investments.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of BMY's legal liability exposure related to Onglyza from 2022 to 2023 reflect changes in their partnership risk with AstraZeneca following the exclusion of plaintiffs' general causation expert in January 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY faced approximately 270 pending claims in federal and state courts related to Onglyza, with the MDL court excluding plaintiffs' general causation expert in January 2022, which significantly weakened the plaintiffs' case. By 2023, the JCCP court granted summary judgment to the defendants, which was affirmed on appeal, and the MDL court also granted summary judgment in August 2022, leaving only a pending appeal in the Sixth Circuit. This legal progression shows that the exclusion of the expert in 2022 directly influenced the favorable outcomes in 2023, reducing BMY's exposure. Since BMY sold Onglyza to AstraZeneca in 2014 and shares liability with them, the reduced legal risk in 2023 reflects a decreased burden on the partnership compared to 2022.",

        "Hop 1: BMY(2022) \u2192 Onglyza: In 2022, BMY faced ~270 claims related to Onglyza, with the MDL court excluding plaintiffs' general causation expert in January 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION\n\nBMS is a party to various product liability lawsuits. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged  personal  injury  and  economic  loss.  As  previously  disclosed,  in  addition  to  lawsuits,  BMS  also  faces  unfiled  claims involving its products.\n\n## Abilify*\n\nBMS and Otsuka are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Abilify* . Plaintiffs allege Abilify* caused them to engage in compulsive gambling and other impulse control disorders. There have been over 2,500 cases filed in state and federal courts and additional  cases  are  pending  in  Canada.  The  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  consolidated  the  federal  court  cases  for pretrial purposes in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. In February 2019, BMS and Otsuka entered into a master  settlement  agreement  establishing  a  proposed  settlement  program  to  resolve  all Abilify* compulsivity  claims  filed  as  of January 28, 2019 in the MDL as well as various state courts, including California and New Jersey. To date, approximately 2,700 cases, comprising approximately 3,900 plaintiffs, have been dismissed based on participation in the settlement program or failure to comply with settlement related court orders. In the U.S., no cases remain in the MDL and less than 5 cases remain pending in state courts  (New  Jersey  and  Massachusetts).  There  are  eleven  cases  pending  in  Canada  (four  class  actions,  seven  individual  injury claims). Out of the eleven cases, only two are active (the class actions in Quebec and Ontario). Both class actions have now been certified and will proceed separately, subject to a pending further appeal of the Ontario class certification decision.\n\n## Byetta*\n\nAmylin, a former subsidiary of BMS, and Lilly are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Byetta*. This litigation involved lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs, which include injury plaintiffs as well as claims by spouses and/or other beneficiaries, in various courts in the U.S. The majority of these cases have been brought by individuals who allege personal injury sustained after using Byetta *, primarily pancreatic cancer, and, in some cases, claiming alleged wrongful death. The majority of cases are pending in Federal Court in San Diego in an MDL or in a coordinated proceeding in California Superior Court in Los Angeles ('JCCP'). In April 2020 the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based on federal preemption and a motion for summary judgment based on the absence of general causation evidence in the MDL and JCCP. Both motions were granted in March 2021 and April 2021, respectively. The orders will result in the dismissal of all claims alleging an injury of pancreatic cancer in the MDL and JCCP. Plaintiffs initially appealed the MDL order, but subsequently filed a motion to dismiss their appeal as to Amylin and Lilly. That motion to dismiss was granted on October 5, 2021 making the MDL decision final as to Amylin and Lilly. Plaintiffs may seek appeals  in  the  JCCP. As  of  December  31,  2021,  Plaintiffs'  counsel  have  submitted  dismissals  with  prejudice  in  exchange  for  a waiver of costs on behalf of nearly 60% of the plaintiffs in the JCCP (including injury plaintiffs and spouse/beneficiary plaintiffs) alleging claims against Amylin and Lilly. Additional dismissals are anticipated. BMS sold Byetta * to AstraZeneca in February 2014 as part of BMS's global diabetes business divestiture and any additional liability to Amylin with respect to Byetta * is expected to be shared with AstraZeneca.\n\n## Onglyza*\n\nBMS and AstraZeneca are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Onglyza* . Plaintiffs assert claims, including claims for wrongful death, as a result of heart failure or other cardiovascular injuries they allege were caused by their use of Onglyza* . As of June 2021, claims are pending in state and federal court on behalf of approximately 270 individuals who allege they ingested the product  and  suffered  an  injury.  In  February  2018,  the  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  ordered  all  federal  cases  to  be transferred  to  an  MDL  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Kentucky. A  significant  majority  of  the  claims  are pending in the MDL, with others pending in a coordinated proceeding in California Superior Court in San Francisco ('JCCP'). In August 2021, the MDL and JCCP courts jointly heard evidence regarding the parties' motions to exclude general causation experts. On September 24, 2021, the JCCP court granted defendants' motion to exclude plaintiffs' only general causation expert and largely denied plaintiffs' motions to exclude defendants' general causation experts; on January 5, 2022, the MDL court likewise granted defendants' motion to exclude plaintiffs' expert and denied entirely plaintiffs' motions. As part of BMS's global diabetes business divestiture, BMS sold Onglyza* to AstraZeneca in February 2014 and any potential liability with respect to Onglyza* is expected to be shared with AstraZeneca.",

      "question": "How did GILD's partnership with Merck in 2022 influence the development and commercialization strategy for long-acting injectable HIV products by 2024, particularly in terms of cost-sharing, leadership responsibilities, and revenue-sharing thresholds?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GILD entered into a collaboration with Merck to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting HIV treatments combining lenacapavir and islatravir, with a 60%/40% cost-sharing split and defined leadership roles: Merck leading U.S. commercialization for injectables and GILD leading in the EU and rest of the world. By 2024, this arrangement remained largely unchanged, with the same cost-sharing model and leadership structure in place, and revenue-sharing thresholds set at $3.5 billion in net product sales for injectables to trigger an increase in GILD's revenue share to 65% above that threshold. Despite no revenues being recognized under the agreement through 2024, the foundational strategy for commercialization and cost structure remained consistent, indicating a stable long-term strategic alignment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Merck &amp; Co, Inc. ('Merck')\n\nOn March 13, 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting investigational treatments in HIV that combine Gilead's investigational capsid  inhibitor,  lenacapavir,  and  Merck's  investigational  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  translocation  inhibitor,  islatravir.  The collaboration will initially focus on long-acting oral and injectable formulations.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck will share global development and commercialization costs at 60% and 40%, respectively, across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, if approved, Gilead would lead commercialization in the United States, and Merck would lead commercialization in the European Union ('EU') and rest of the world. For long-acting injectable products, if approved, Merck would lead commercialization in the United States and Gilead would lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world. Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck would jointly promote  the  combination  products  in  the  United  States  and  certain  other  major  markets.  If  successful,  we  would  share  global product revenues with Merck equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-determined per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion in net product sales for the oral combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue would increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Upon passing $3.5 billion in net product sales for the injectable combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue will increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Reimbursements of research and development costs to or from Merck are recorded within Research and development expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  Expenses  recognized  under  the  agreement  were  not  material  for  the  year ended December 31, 2021. No revenues have been recognized under the agreement for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nWe will also have the option to license certain of Merck's investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination with lenacapavir. Reciprocally, Merck will have the option to license certain of Gilead's investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination with islatravir. Each company may exercise its option for such investigational oral integrase inhibitor of the other company within the first five years after execution of the agreement, following completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial of that  integrase  inhibitor.  Upon  exercise  of  an  option,  the  companies  will  split  development  costs  and  revenues,  unless  the  nonexercising company decides to opt-out, in which case the non-exercising company will be paid a royalty.\n\nIn December 2021, Merck announced the decision of the parties to stop all dosing of participants in the Phase 2 clinical study evaluating  an  oral-weekly  combination  treatment  regimen  of  lenacapavir  and  islatravir  following  the  decision  of  FDA  to  place clinical holds on the investigational new drug applications for certain formulations of islatravir.\n\n## Arcus\n\nOn May 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction with Arcus, a publicly traded oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, which included entry into an option, license and collaboration agreement (the 'Collaboration Agreement') and a common stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement (together, and as subsequently amended the 'Stock Purchase Agreements'). In accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreements, which closed on July 13, 2020, we made an upfront payment of $175 million and acquired approximately 6.0 million shares of Arcus common stock for approximately $200  million.  Of  the  total  $391  million  initial  cash  payments,  including  transactional  costs,  made  under  the  agreements,  we recorded $135 million as an equity investment which was calculated based on Arcus' closing stock price on the closing date of the transaction. The remaining $256 million was attributed to (i) the acquired license and option rights of $175 million representing IPR&amp;D assets with no alternative future use, (ii) $65 million of an issuance premium for the equity purchase and (iii) $16 million of direct transactional costs. These amounts were expensed as Acquired in-process research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nUnder the Stock Purchase Agreements, we have the right to purchase additional shares of Arcus from Arcus over the five-year period beginning on the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreements, up to a maximum of 35% of the outstanding voting stock. We are subject to a three-year standstill, restricting our ability to acquire voting stock of Arcus exceeding more than 35% of the thenissued and outstanding voting stock of Arcus, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, we agreed not to dispose of any equity securities of Arcus prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreements without the prior consent of Arcus, subject to certain exceptions. On May 29, 2020, in a separate secondary equity offering, we acquired 2.2 million shares of common stock of Arcus for approximately $61 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we also acquired approximately 5.7 million additional shares of Arcus common stock for $220 million. As a result, we currently own a total of 13.8 million shares of Arcus, which represented approximately 19.5% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of Arcus immediately following the closing of the first quarter 2021 transaction.",

          "chunk_text": "## Arcellx\n\nIn January 2023, we closed an agreement to enter into a global strategic collaboration with Arcellx, a public company, to co-develop and co-commercialize Arcellx's lead late-stage product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and potential future nextgeneration  autologous  and  non-autologous  products.  In  December  2023,  we  amended  the  agreement  and  expanded  the  scope  of  the  collaboration  to  include lymphomas and exercised our option to negotiate a license for Arcellx's ARC-SparX program, ACLX-001, in multiple myeloma. In conjunction with the collaboration, we recorded a combined $313 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2023, primarily related to upfront payments. We also recorded a combined equity investment of $299 million. Our equity investment is subject to lock-up provisions until June 2025 and is included in Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024. The companies will share development, clinical  trial  and  commercialization  costs  for  CART-ddBCMA  and  will  jointly  commercialize  the  product  and  split  U.S.  profits 50/50.  Outside  the  U.S.,  we  will commercialize  the  product  and Arcellx  will  receive  royalties  on  sales.  Under  the  agreement, Arcellx   is  eligible  to  receive  performance-based  development  and regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.5 billion related to CART-ddBCMA, a potential future next-generation autologous product and a potential future nonautologous product, with further commercial milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote the future products. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid $68 million for development milestones met, which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If additional future products are developed, Arcellx would be eligible to receive additional milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote these additional future products as well.\n\n## Dragonfly\n\nIn April  2022,  we  entered  into  a  strategic  research  collaboration  agreement  (the  'Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement')  with  Dragonfly  Therapeutics,  Inc. ('Dragonfly') to develop natural killer ('NK') cell engager-based immunotherapies for oncology and inflammation indications. Under the terms of the Dragonfly Collaboration Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide license from Dragonfly for the 5T4-targeting investigational immunotherapy program, DF7001, as well as  options,  after  the  completion  of  certain  preclinical  activities,  to  license  ex clusive,  worldwide  rights  to  develop  and  commercialize  additional  NK  cell  engager programs using the  Dragonfly  Tri-specific  NK  Engager  platform.  Upon  the  closing  of  the  Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement,  we  made  a  $300  million  upfront payment to Dragonfly, and we made an additional $15 million payment related to a target selection in connection with an August 2022 amendment to the agreement, which were recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. In July 2023, we mutually agreed to terminate the DF7001 program. If we exercise our options on additional NK cell engager programs, Dragonfly would be eligible to receive opt-in payments and performance-based development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on worldwide net sales on these optioned programs.\n\n## Merck\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. ('Merck') to jointly develop  and  commercialize  long-acting  investigational  treatments  in  HIV   that  combine  G ilead's  investigational  capsid  inhibitor,  lenacapavir,  and  Merck's investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. The collaboration is initially focused on long-acting oral and injectable formulations.\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  as  amended,  G ilead  and  Merck  will  mostly  share  global  development  and  commercialization  costs  at 60%  and 40%, respectively, across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, if approved, G ilead would lead commercialization in the U.S., and Merck would lead  commercialization  in  the  European  Union  ('EU')  and  rest  of  the  world.

No revenues have been recognized under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

If additional future products are developed, Arcellx would be eligible to receive additional milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote these additional future products as well.\n\n## Dragonfly\n\nIn April  2022,  we  entered  into  a  strategic  research  collaboration  agreement  (the  'Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement')  with  Dragonfly  Therapeutics,  Inc. ('Dragonfly') to develop natural killer ('NK') cell engager-based immunotherapies for oncology and inflammation indications. Under the terms of the Dragonfly Collaboration Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide license from Dragonfly for the 5T4-targeting investigational immunotherapy program, DF7001, as well as  options,  after  the  completion  of  certain  preclinical  activities,  to  license  ex clusive,  worldwide  rights  to  develop  and  commercialize  additional  NK  cell  engager programs using the  Dragonfly  Tri-specific  NK  Engager  platform.  Upon  the  closing  of  the  Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement,  we  made  a  $300  million  upfront payment to Dragonfly, and we made an additional $15 million payment related to a target selection in connection with an August 2022 amendment to the agreement, which were recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. In July 2023, we mutually agreed to terminate the DF7001 program. If we exercise our options on additional NK cell engager programs, Dragonfly would be eligible to receive opt-in payments and performance-based development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on worldwide net sales on these optioned programs.\n\n## Merck\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. ('Merck') to jointly develop  and  commercialize  long-acting  investigational  treatments  in  HIV   that  combine  G ilead's  investigational  capsid  inhibitor,  lenacapavir,  and  Merck's investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. The collaboration is initially focused on long-acting oral and injectable formulations.\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  as  amended,  G ilead  and  Merck  will  mostly  share  global  development  and  commercialization  costs  at 60%  and 40%, respectively, across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, if approved, G ilead would lead commercialization in the U.S., and Merck would lead  commercialization  in  the  European  Union  ('EU')  and  rest  of  the  world.  For  long-acting  injectable  products,  if  approved,  Merck  would  lead commercialization in the U.S. and G ilead would lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world. Under the terms of the agreement, G ilead and Merck would jointly promote the combination products in the U.S. and certain other major markets. If successful, we would share global product revenues with Merck equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-determined per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion in net product sales for the oral combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue would increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Upon passing $3.5 billion in net product sales for the injectable combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue will increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Reimbursements of R&amp;D costs to or from Merck are recorded within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenses recognized under the agreement were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. No revenues have been recognized under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

      "question": "How did the change in DHR's fair value estimation methods between 2022 and 2023 impact their pension plan contribution requirements, given the role of valuation methods in determining fair value estimates?",
      "answer": "In 2022, DHR used valuation methods such as market multiples, third-party appraisals, and quoted market prices to estimate fair value, which influenced its pension contribution expectations of $10 million for U.S. plans and $48 million for non-U.S. plans. By 2023, the same valuation methods were still in place, but the estimated contributions decreased to $9 million for U.S. plans and $35 million for non-U.S. plans. This suggests that either the fair value estimates of the pension assets increased or the funded status of the plans improved, reducing the required contributions. The fair value estimation process remained judgment-intensive, with potential variability based on different methodologies or assumptions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DHR(2022) \u2192 Valuation Methods: DHR disclosed using market multiples, third-party appraisals, and quoted market prices to estimate fair value in 2022, with expected pension contributions of $10M (U.S.) and $48M (non-U.S.).",
        "Hop 2: Valuation Methods \u2192 Fair Value Estimation: The use of these valuation methods introduced subjectivity and potential variability in fair value estimates, as noted in the 2023 MET document, due to market conditions and differing assumptions.",
        "Hop 3: Fair Value Estimation \u2190 DHR(2023): In 2023, DHR continued using the same valuation methods, but expected pension contributions decreased to $9M (U.S.) and $35M (non-U.S.), indicating a change in fair value estimates or plan funded status."

      "answer": "In 2023, U.S. Aranesp sales declined due to lower unit demand, driven by independent and medium-sized dialysis organizations transitioning from Aranesp to EPOGEN. This shift indicates growing adoption of EPOGEN in the dialysis market segment. By 2024, EPOGEN remained a key product in Amgen's anemia treatment portfolio, alongside Aranesp, suggesting that EPOGEN gained relative importance as a competitive offering against biosimilars and in response to customer transitions. The continued listing of EPOGEN among Amgen\u2019s marketed products in 2024 highlights its sustained strategic role in the company\u2019s broader anemia treatment strategy, despite the ongoing competitive pressures noted in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LLY relied heavily on extended market exclusivity for biologics, particularly through the 12-year U.S. data protection period under the BPCIA and potential orphan designations in the EU, which provide seven years of market exclusivity. These protections were critical for maintaining revenue streams from key biologics. By 2023, LLY faced increasing regulatory risk, including a proposal by the European Commission to reduce data package protection by two years, directly threatening the duration of market exclusivity for their biologics. This regulatory shift, combined with U.S. legislative proposals to limit patent strategies, forced LLY to emphasize stronger defense of existing patent rights and to advocate against policy changes that could further erode their intellectual property position. The company's 2023 disclosures reflect a strategic pivot toward reinforcing patent portfolios and engaging in policy advocacy to preserve exclusivity periods.",

          "chunk_text": "Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product, which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However, in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:\n\n- Regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period of data package protection depends on the country. For example, the period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics as described below), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent.\n- Under the BPCIA, the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, subject to certain conditions.\n- In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusivity\" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data protection and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant patents, to the extent these protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity attaches to the term of any relevant patent, pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity-i.e., a bar to generic or biosimilar approval, not a patent right.\n- Under the U.S. orphan drug law, a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive \"orphan\" designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits, orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric exclusivity, the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents.\n\nOutside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely, and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization, more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of \"flexibilities\" allowed under the agreement. Thus, some types of patents, such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules, are not available in certain developing countries. Further, many developing countries, and some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in TRIPs.\n\n## Our Intellectual Property Portfolio\n\nWe consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations-particularly with respect to those products discussed below-to be important to our operations. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold patents on manufacturing processes, formulations, devices, or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below. For approved products, dates include, where applicable, pending or granted patent term extensions.",

We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which  the  product  has  market  exclusivity. A  product's  market  exclusivity  is  generally  determined  by  two  forms  of  intellectual property:  patent  rights  held  by  the  innovator  company  and  any  regulatory  forms  of  exclusivity  to  which  the  innovative  drug  is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to  exclude  others  from  practicing  an  invention  related  to  the  medicine.  Patents  may  cover,  among  other  things,  the  active ingredient(s),  various  uses  of  a  drug  product,  pharmaceutical  formulations,  drug  delivery  mechanisms  and  processes  for  (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory data protection exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, in the U.S., EU, Japan and certain other countries, RDP exclusivity rights are offered as incentives for research on medicines for rare diseases, or orphan drugs, and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. These incentives can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.",

      "question": "How did JNJ's 2022 concerns about counterfeit pharmaceuticals and supply chain vulnerabilities influence its 2024 adoption and commercialization strategy for AI-driven product tracking technologies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ highlighted significant risks related to counterfeit medicines entering the supply chain, which threatened patient safety, eroded consumer trust, and risked lost sales (JNJ_10k_2022.pdf). These vulnerabilities were compounded by supply chain disruptions from the ongoing effects of the pandemic, which further exposed weaknesses in traceability and control. By 2024, JNJ began integrating AI-driven technologies into its product tracking systems, aiming to enhance supply chain integrity and combat counterfeiting (JNJ_10k_2024.pdf). However, the company acknowledged new risks associated with AI adoption, including potential obsolescence of newly implemented systems and regulatory uncertainty. The evolution from supply chain risk awareness in 2022 to strategic AI implementation in 2024 reflects a direct response to earlier vulnerabilities, though with tempered expectations due to emerging technological and regulatory challenges.",

Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured -often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites -as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.\n\nThe industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company's business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Company's employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\n\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Company's future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and impact of variants. Any resurgence in COVID-19 could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\n\nWe also face uncertainties related to our COVID-19 vaccine, including uncertainties related to the risk that our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy, safety and durability; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&amp;D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this 'Risk Factors' section and those incorporated by reference herein, including risks relating to the Company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in laws relating to supply of the Company's products. Given that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company.",

The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by M icron, a supplier of ours. A s another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an A ction Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the A ction Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability  of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\nFinally , our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in T aiwan and South Korea. A ny new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from T aiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\n## Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\n\nCertain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and government regulators have focused on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in the U.S. that may differ from other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders' expectations. A dditionally , our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards or legal requirements. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices and legal requirements, choose not to conduct business with potential customers and suppliers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers and suppliers due to our policies. These factors and increased disclosure may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or ex pose us to liability .\n\n## Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\n\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as A I, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability  and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building A I capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone A I applications. A I poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society , such as A I solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity , or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy , employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability . Lev eraging A I capabilities to potentially  improv e our internal functions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to A I may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code of Practice for General Purpose A rtificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission regarding details of some of our Trustworthy A I processes related to our risk framework. Furthermore, changes in A I-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of A I by  us or others could undermine public confidence in A I and slow adoption of A I in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\n\n## Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify .

          "chunk_text": "## Risks related to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization\n\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company's innovation, development and implementation of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company's long-term success.\n\nThe Company's continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company's existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2024 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.\n\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients' and healthcare providers' future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company's products from competing products and approaches to treatment. M oreover, the development and regulatory approval of new products may be delayed due to limits on federal agency budgets or personnel, including reductions to the U.S. FDA 's budget, employees, and operations, which may lead to slower response times and longer review periods. A fter approval, new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.\n\nThe Company leverages the use of data science, machine learning and other forms of AI and emerging technologies across varying parts of its business and operations, and the introduction and incorporation of A I may result in unintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities. A I technology is continuously evolving, and the A I technologies we develop and adopt may become obsolete earlier than planned. Our investments in these technologies may not result in the benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive advantage. The application of A I in our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws and regulations that may entail significant costs or ultimately limit our ability to continue the use of these technologies. These technologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security further described below.\n\n## Risks related to financial and economic market conditions\n\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally.\n\nThe Company's extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\n\nForeign currency exchange : In fiscal 2024, approximately 43% of the Company's sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe, 5% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 15% in the Asia-Pacific and A frica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company's revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company's non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\n\nInflation and currency devaluation risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in A rgentina, Turkey, V enezuela and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-y ear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n13",

This arrangement included a 60% co-promotion fee when a sale was made to the other party's assigned customer. By 2024, Orencia generated $3,682 million in revenue, reflecting a 2% increase from $3,601 million in 2023. The production responsibilities remained consistent with the 2022 agreement, with BMY maintaining supply and order fulfillment for the intravenous formulation, while Ono managed the subcutaneous version.

Ono is entitled to receive royalties of 4% in North America and 15% in all territories excluding the three countries listed above, subject to customary adjustments.\n\n## Nektar\n\nIn  2018,  BMS  and  Nektar  commenced  a  worldwide  license  and  collaboration  for  the  development  and  commercialization  of Bempegaldesleukin  (NKTR-214),  Nektar's  investigational  immuno-stimulatory  therapy  designed  to  selectively  expand  specific cancer-fighting T cells and natural killer cells directly in the tumor micro-environment. In January 2020, the parties amended the collaboration agreement. The Opdivo and NKTR-214 combination therapy is currently in Phase III clinical studies for metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and RCC. A joint development plan agreed by the parties as part of the original agreement, and updated as part of the January 2020 amendment, specifies development in certain indications and tumor types  with  each  party  responsible  for  the  supply  of  their  own  product.  BMS's  share  of  the  development  costs  associated  with therapies comprising a BMS medicine used in combination with NKTR-214 is 67.5%, subject to certain cost caps for Nektar. The January  2020  amendment  retains  the  cost  sharing  percentages  from  the  original  agreement.  The  parties  will  also  jointly commercialize  the  therapies,  subject  to  regulatory  approval.  BMS's  share  of  global  NKTR-214  profits  and  losses  will  be  35% subject to certain annual loss caps for Nektar.\n\nBMS paid Nektar $1.85 billion for the rights discussed above and 8.3 million shares of Nektar common stock which represented a 4.8% ownership interest.  BMS's equity  ownership  is  subject  to  certain  lock-up,  standstill  and  voting  provisions  for  a  five-year period. The amount of the up-front payment allocated to the equity investment was $800 million after considering Nektar's stock price on the date of closing and current limitations on trading the securities. The remaining $1.05 billion of the up-front payment was allocated to the rights discussed above. BMS will also pay up to $1.8 billion upon the achievement of contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones over the life of the alliance period. Research and development cost reimbursements were $98 million in 2021, $132 million in 2020 and $108 million in 2019.\n\n## 2seventy bio (formerly bluebird)\n\nOn November 4, 2021, bluebird completed the tax-free spin-off of its oncology programs and portfolio into 2seventy bio, Inc., an independent, publicly-traded company.\n\nThe  parties  jointly  develop  and  commercialize  novel  disease-altering  gene  therapy  product  candidates  targeting  BCMA.  The collaboration arrangement began in 2013 and included (i) a right for BMS to license any anti-BCMA products resulting from the collaboration,  (ii)  a  right  for  2seventy  bio  to  participate  in  the  development  and  commercialization  of  any  licensed  products resulting  from  the  collaboration  through  a  50/50  co-development  and  profit  share  in  the  U.S.  in  exchange  for  a  reduction  of milestone  payments,  and  (iii)  sales-based  milestones  and  royalties  payable  to  2seventy  bio  upon  the  commercialization  of  any licensed  products  resulting  from  the  collaboration  if  2seventy  bio  declined  to  exercise  their  co-development  and  profit  sharing rights. The options to license idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121) and bb21217 were exercised in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2022, the parties elected to not pursue further development of bb21217.\n\nAll profits and losses relating to developing, commercializing and manufacturing ide-cel within the U.S. are shared equally. BMS is exclusively responsible for the development and commercialization of ide-cel outside the U.S.\n\nIn  2020,  terms  of  the  collaboration  were  amended  including  certain  manufacturing  obligations.  Both  parties  were  also  released from future exclusivity related to BCMA-directed T cell therapies. BMS paid $200 million to extinguish its obligation for future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on ide-cel, which was included in Research and development expense in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the FDA approved ide-cel (' Abecma ' ) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Net product sales of Abecma  within  the  Alliance  territory  were  $158  million  and  related  profit  sharing  costs  were  $42  million  in  2021.  Cost reimbursements were not material.",

BMS  is  responsible  for  the  order  fulfillment  and distribution of the intravenous formulation and Ono is responsible for the subcutaneous formulation. Both formulations are jointly promoted by both parties with assigned customer accounts and BMS is responsible for the product supply. A co-promotion fee of 60% is paid when a sale is made to the other party's assigned customer.\n\nIn 2019, Ono exercised the right to accept NKTR-214 into the alliance with BMS upon completion of a Phase I clinical study of Opdivo and NKTR-214 in the Ono Territory. Ono partially reimbursed BMS for development costs incurred with the study and shares in certain future development costs, contingent milestone payments, profits and losses under the collaboration with Nektar.\n\nIn 2017, Ono granted BMS an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of ONO-4578, Ono's Prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 antagonist. In 2020, the rights were terminated by both parties.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Imbruvica was selected as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices under the Inflation Reduction Act, with pricing set to begin in 2026. This regulatory development introduced significant risk to AbbVie's revenue outlook for the drug. By 2024, AbbVie had adjusted its financial and strategic planning accordingly, emphasizing pipeline diversification and on-market product investment while noting the potential for accelerated revenue erosion due to the new pricing framework. The company reported $56.3 billion in worldwide net revenues for 2024, but also highlighted the looming impact of the CMS-published Part D prices for Imbruvica, which will take effect in 2026, signaling a strategic shift to mitigate future revenue losses from government price setting.",

        "Hop 1: ABBV(2023) \u2192 Imbruvica: AbbVie co-commercializes Imbruvica in the U.S. and shares profits equally with Janssen, with Imbruvica contributing to AbbVie\u2019s $54.3 billion in 2023 net revenues.",

        "Hop 3: Government Price Setting \u2190 ABBV(2024): In 2024, AbbVie acknowledged the CMS publication of Part D prices for Imbruvica, incorporating this regulatory risk into its strategic planning and noting the potential for accelerated revenue erosion prior to patent expiration."

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Strategic Objectives\n\nAbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key onmarket products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also continuing to repay debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.\n\nAbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:\n\n- Maximizing revenue growth of our key on-market products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, Elahere, Vraylar, Ubrelvy, Qulipta, Vyalev/Produodopa, Botox and Juvederm Collection.\n- Advancing our research and development pipeline by delivering late-stage pipeline milestones, achieving key proof-of-concept objectives across therapeutic areas and continuing to invest in key on-market product indication expansion.\n- Maximizing the value of key acquisitions as well as continuing to invest in external innovation.\n- Continuing to effectively manage the impact of Humira biosimilar erosion.\n- The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2025. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled \"Research and Development\" included as part of this Item 7.\n\n## 2024 Financial Results\n\nAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2024 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $56.3 billion, operating earnings of $9.1 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.39 and cash flows from operations of $18.8 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 4% on a reported and 5% on a constant currency basis.\n\nDiluted earnings per share in 2024 was $2.39 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.5 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $3.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $3.5 billion related to intangible asset impairment; (iv) $978 million of acquisition and integration expenses; and (v) $721 million for charges related to litigation matters. These costs were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $1.8 billion primarily related to the settlement of income tax examinations. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie's pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie's on-market brands.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has and will continue to have a significant impact on how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program, i ncluding through the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose price increases outpace inflation, the redesign of Medicare Part D benefits to shift a greater portion of the costs to manufacturers, and through government price-setting for certain Medicare Part B and Part D drugs. In 2023, Imbruvica was selected as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. In 2024, the CMS published Medicare Part D prices that will be applicable to the 10 selected drugs, including Imbruvica, beginning in 2026. In January 2025, HHS, through the CMS, selected Vraylar and Linzess as two of the 15 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1 'Business - Regulation - Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing,' Part I, Item 1A 'Risk Factors' and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

      "question": "How did the revenue performance of Emgality in 2023 relate to the data protection timeline for the product across key global markets, and how might this have influenced LLY's intellectual property strategy in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Emgality generated $482.2 million in U.S. revenue and $196.0 million in revenue from outside the U.S., indicating its significance as a neuroscience product. Emgality is subject to biologics data protection in the U.S. until 2030, data protection in major European countries until 2028, and data protection in Japan until 2029. These protection timelines likely informed LLY's 2024 intellectual property strategy, which emphasizes the importance of data protection and patent coverage for maintaining market exclusivity and supporting long-term revenue potential for key products like Emgality.",

      "question": "How did the decline in MRK's reliance on Bridion as a key product from 2023 to 2024 reflect the impact of patent expiration in international markets, and what does this indicate about the company's ability to offset revenue losses through other product lines?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MRK identified Bridion as a key product that contributed significantly to profits and cash flows, but it also noted that the product lost market exclusivity in the EU and was set to lose exclusivity in Japan in 2024 and the U.S. in 2026, with expectations of substantial sales declines in those markets. By 2024, Bridion's total global sales had decreased from $1,842 million in 2023 to $1,764 million in 2024, reflecting a $78 million drop. This decline aligns with the expected impact of patent expirations in international markets. However, MRK's overall pharmaceutical segment sales increased from $53,583 million in 2023 to $57,400 million in 2024, suggesting that the company was able to offset some of the revenue losses from Bridion through growth in other product lines, particularly Keytruda, which saw a $4,469 million increase in total sales year-over-year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK(2023) \u2192 Key Products: In 2023, MRK emphasized its dependence on key products like Bridion for profits and cash flows, while also acknowledging the risks associated with patent expirations and the expected loss of exclusivity in key international markets.",
        "Hop 2: Key Products \u2192 Bridion: Bridion was specifically called out in 2023 as having lost exclusivity in the EU and set to lose exclusivity in Japan in 2024 and the U.S. in 2026, with the company projecting a significant decline in sales as a result.",
        "Hop 3: Bridion \u2190 MRK(2024): By 2024, Bridion's global sales had declined from $1,842 million in 2023 to $1,764 million, consistent with the anticipated impact of patent expiration in international markets."

      "question": "How did the ongoing litigation risks involving Celgene in 2022 influence the impairment charges related to Celgene-acquired R&D assets in 2023, and what does this suggest about BMY's post-acquisition portfolio risk assessment and prioritization?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY (as Bristol-Myers Squibb) faced ongoing litigation risks tied to Celgene, including a lawsuit from MSP in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, where plaintiffs pursued claims related to the reimbursement of Celgene drugs like Thalomid and Revlimid. These legal challenges, part of a broader set of litigation exposures, reflected continued liabilities from the Celgene acquisition. In 2023, BMY disclosed $610 million and $230 million in IPRD impairment charges tied directly to Celgene-acquired compounds \u2014 one partially written down due to changes in clinical timelines and competitive pressures, and the other fully written off due to discontinuation. The temporal evolution from litigation exposure in 2022 to asset write-downs in 2023 suggests that unresolved legal risks and shifting strategic priorities post-acquisition led to a reevaluation of Celgene\u2019s R&D pipeline, resulting in significant financial adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BMY(2022) \u2192 MSP: In December 2021, MSP sued Celgene and BMS over claims tied to the reimbursement of Celgene drugs, reflecting ongoing litigation exposure post-acquisition.",
        "Hop 2: MSP \u2192 Celgene: The lawsuit was part of a broader set of legal actions involving Celgene\u2019s products, indicating persistent liabilities linked to the company\u2019s legacy operations.",
        "Hop 3: Celgene \u2190 BMY(2023): In 2023, BMY recorded $610M and $230M in IPRD impairment charges for Celgene-acquired compounds, showing a direct financial consequence tied to Celgene\u2019s R&D assets post-litigation exposure."

          "chunk_text": "In  May  2020,  Celgene  filed  suit  against  Humana  Pharmacy,  Inc.  ('HPI'),  a  Humana  subsidiary,  in  Delaware  Superior  Court. Celgene's complaint alleges that HPI breached its contractual obligations to Celgene by assigning claims to Humana that Humana is now asserting. The complaint seeks damages for HPI's breach as well as a declaratory judgment. A trial has been scheduled for March 2023.\n\nIn July 2020, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association ('BCBSA') sued Celgene and BMS on behalf of the Federal Employee Program in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. BCBSA's complaint makes largely the same claims and allegations as were made in the class action litigation. In April 2021, the parties' joint motion to transfer the action to the District of New Jersey was granted and the case is now pending in that Court. No trial date has been scheduled.\n\nIn August 2020, BCBSM Inc., Health Care Service Corporation ('HCSC'), Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida Inc., and Molina Healthcare, Inc. ('Molina') sued Celgene and BMS in a Minnesota state court. The complaint makes largely the same claims and allegations as were made in the class action litigation but adds allegations on behalf of HCSC only as to alleged off-label marketing of Thalomid and Revlimid . In September 2020, Celgene and BMS removed the action to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. In March 2021, that Court denied plaintiffs' motion to remand the action to state court, dismissed Molina for lack of personal jurisdiction and granted defendants' motion to transfer the action to the District of New Jersey. The case is now pending in the District of New Jersey. No trial date has been scheduled.\n\nIn  January  2021,  Cigna  Corporation  ('Cigna')  sued  Celgene  and  BMS  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of Pennsylvania. Cigna's complaint makes largely the same claims and allegations as were made in the class action litigation. Cigna's complaint purports to assert claims on behalf of Cigna and its subsidiaries in several capacities, including as a direct purchaser and as an indirect purchaser. In May 2021, the parties' joint motion to transfer the action to the District of New Jersey was granted and the case is now pending in that Court. No trial date has been scheduled.\n\nIn May 2021, Molina sued Celgene and BMS in San Francisco Superior Court. Molina's complaint makes largely the same claims and allegations as were made in the class action litigation. In July 2021, Celgene and BMS removed the action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and in January 2022, that court granted Molina's motion to remand to San Francisco Superior Court. No trial date has been scheduled.\n\nIn December 2021, a group of plaintiffs-MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC; MSPA Claims 1, LLC; MAO-MSO Recovery II, LLC, Series PMPI, a segregated series of MAO-MSO Recovery II, LLC; MSP Recovery Claims Series 44, LLC; MSP Recovery Claims PROV, Series LLC; and MSP Recovery Claims CAID, Series LLC (together, 'MSP')-sued Celgene and BMS in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. MSP's complaint makes largely the same claims and allegations as were made in the class action litigation. MSP purports to pursue assignments from certain named and unnamed entities that allegedly purchased or otherwise provided reimbursement for Thalomid and/or Revlimid ,  and purports to bring direct and indirect purchaser claims. No trial date has been scheduled.\n\n## GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\nLike other pharmaceutical companies, BMS and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which BMS operates. As a result, BMS, from time to time, is subject to various governmental and regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as threatened legal actions and proceedings. It is possible that criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, could result from government or regulatory investigations.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nAs previously reported, BMS is a party to several environmental proceedings and other matters, and is responsible under various state, federal and foreign laws, including CERCLA, for certain costs of investigating and/or remediating contamination resulting from past industrial activity at BMS's current or former sites or at waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties.\n\n## CERCLA Matters\n\nWith respect to CERCLA matters for which BMS is responsible under various state, federal and international laws, BMS typically estimates potential costs based on information obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or counterpart state or foreign agency and/or studies prepared by independent consultants, including the total estimated costs for the site and the expected cost-sharing, if any, with other 'potentially responsible parties,' and BMS accrues liabilities when they are probable and reasonably estimable. BMS estimated its share of future costs for these sites to be $89 million at December 31, 2021, which represents the sum of best estimates or, where no best estimate can reasonably be made, estimates of the minimal probable amount among a range of such costs (without taking into account any potential recoveries from other parties). The amount includes the estimated costs for any additional probable loss associated with the previously disclosed North Brunswick Township High School Remediation Site.",

In July 2021, Celgene and BMS removed the action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and in January 2022, that court granted Molina's motion to remand to San Francisco Superior Court. No trial date has been scheduled.\n\nIn December 2021, a group of plaintiffs-MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC; MSPA Claims 1, LLC; MAO-MSO Recovery II, LLC, Series PMPI, a segregated series of MAO-MSO Recovery II, LLC; MSP Recovery Claims Series 44, LLC; MSP Recovery Claims PROV, Series LLC; and MSP Recovery Claims CAID, Series LLC (together, 'MSP')-sued Celgene and BMS in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. MSP's complaint makes largely the same claims and allegations as were made in the class action litigation. MSP purports to pursue assignments from certain named and unnamed entities that allegedly purchased or otherwise provided reimbursement for Thalomid and/or Revlimid ,  and purports to bring direct and indirect purchaser claims. No trial date has been scheduled.\n\n## GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\nLike other pharmaceutical companies, BMS and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which BMS operates. As a result, BMS, from time to time, is subject to various governmental and regulatory inquiries and investigations as well as threatened legal actions and proceedings. It is possible that criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, could result from government or regulatory investigations.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nAs previously reported, BMS is a party to several environmental proceedings and other matters, and is responsible under various state, federal and foreign laws, including CERCLA, for certain costs of investigating and/or remediating contamination resulting from past industrial activity at BMS's current or former sites or at waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties.\n\n## CERCLA Matters\n\nWith respect to CERCLA matters for which BMS is responsible under various state, federal and international laws, BMS typically estimates potential costs based on information obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or counterpart state or foreign agency and/or studies prepared by independent consultants, including the total estimated costs for the site and the expected cost-sharing, if any, with other 'potentially responsible parties,' and BMS accrues liabilities when they are probable and reasonably estimable. BMS estimated its share of future costs for these sites to be $89 million at December 31, 2021, which represents the sum of best estimates or, where no best estimate can reasonably be made, estimates of the minimal probable amount among a range of such costs (without taking into account any potential recoveries from other parties). The amount includes the estimated costs for any additional probable loss associated with the previously disclosed North Brunswick Township High School Remediation Site.",

      "question": "How did the change in MRK's reliance on Bravecto as a key product evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what impact did this have on the company's overall revenue diversification risk?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MRK's key products\u2014including Bravecto\u2014were central to its profitability and cash flow, with the top products like Keytruda and Gardasil/Gardasil 9 accounting for 56% of total sales. The company acknowledged that any adverse event affecting these products could have a material impact. By 2024, Keytruda alone accounted for 46% of total sales, indicating a relative shift in revenue concentration away from other key products like Bravecto. This suggests that Bravecto's strategic importance may have slightly diminished in 2024 compared to 2023, though it remained a listed key product. The increased concentration in Keytruda heightens MRK's revenue diversification risk, making the company more vulnerable to events affecting its top-selling oncology drug.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK(2023) \u2192 Key Products: In 2023, MRK's profitability and cash flow were heavily dependent on key products like Keytruda, Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Lynparza, Bravecto, and Bridion, which together accounted for 56% of total sales.",
        "Hop 2: Key Products \u2192 Bravecto: Bravecto was explicitly listed among MRK's key products in 2023, indicating its material contribution to the company's revenue and profitability.",
        "Hop 3: Bravecto \u2190 MRK(2024): In 2024, while Bravecto remained a key product, the company's revenue became more concentrated in Keytruda, which alone accounted for 46% of total sales, suggesting a relative decrease in Bravecto's strategic weight."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Key products generate a significant amount of the Company's profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for its leading products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flows depends largely upon the continued profitability of the Company's key products, such as Keytruda , Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Lynparza, Bravecto , and Bridion . In 2024, the Company's oncology portfolio, led by Keytruda , represented substantially all of the Company's revenue growth. In particular, in the aggregate, in 2024, sales of Keytruda represented 46% of the Company's total sales. A s a result of the Company's dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products, such as the slowing demand for Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in China which the Company has experienced, could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and financial condition. Other events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the Company's product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the sales of any such products.\n\n## The Company's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in other ways; consequently , the Company may not be able to replace sales of successful products that lose patent protection.\n\nIn order to remain competitive, the Company , like other major pharmaceutical companies, must continue to launch new products. Expected declines in sales of products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the Company's future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products that it may develop through collaborations and joint ventures and products that it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. T o accomplish this, the Company commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development, both through its own dedicated resources and through various collaborations with third parties. There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs and vaccines. A s a result, there is a high risk that funds invested by the Company in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. T o bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market may take a decade or more and failure can occur at any point in the process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested.\n\nFor a description of the research and development process, see Item 1. 'Business - Research and Development' above. Each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals. Therefore, the Company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and resources. Some of the risks encountered in the research and development process include the following: preclinical testing of a new compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be disappointing.\n\nThe Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to  develop,  license  or  otherwise  acquire  compounds,  product  candidates  or  products;  or  whether  any  products,  once  launched,  will  be  commercially successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## The Company's success is dependent on the successful development and marketing of new products, which are subject to substantial risks.\n\nProducts that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or fail to succeed for numerous reasons, including the following:\n\n- findings of ineffectiv eness, superior safety or efficacy of competing products, or harmful side effects in clinical or preclinical testing;",

      "question": "How did the progression of BMY's nivolumab-based combination therapy from its 2022 regulatory review status to the 2024 commercial performance of Opdualag reflect the strategic evolution of its melanoma treatment portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY's nivolumab was positioned as part of a novel fixed-dose combination with relatlimab for melanoma treatment, with regulatory submissions accepted by both the FDA and EMA based on the RELATIVITY-047 trial data showing improved progression-free survival. By 2024, this combination had been commercialized as Opdualag, generating $928 million in revenue, a 48% increase from the prior year, indicating strong market adoption and strategic emphasis on this therapeutic area. The evolution from a regulatory focus in 2022 to a high-growth product in 2024 demonstrates BMY's successful transition of the nivolumab-relatlimab combination into a key asset within its oncology portfolio.",

      "question": "How did the legal outcomes involving Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in JNJ's patent litigation cases evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about JNJ's ability to defend its drug patents in court?",
      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ (via its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) was involved in litigation against Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. regarding the patent infringement of INVEGA TRINZA (U.S. Patent No. 10,143,693). The District Court ruled in May 2023 that Mylan's proposed generic product infringed the patent and that the patent was valid. Mylan appealed the decision. By 2024, the appeal was still pending, with oral arguments held in February 2025, indicating that the legal battle had extended beyond the initial ruling. This evolution shows that JNJ initially succeeded in defending its patent in district court, but the continuation of the appeal suggests ongoing uncertainty and the need for sustained legal efforts to protect its intellectual property.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JNJ (2023) \u2192 Defendant (LITIGATION): JNJ filed patent infringement lawsuits against multiple generic manufacturers, including Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., over INVEGA TRINZA.",
        "Hop 2: Defendant \u2192 Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Mylan was specifically named as a defendant in the litigation over U.S. Patent No. 10,143,693 for INVEGA TRINZA, with a district court ruling in JNJ\u2019s favor in May 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \u2190 JNJ (2024): In 2024, the litigation involving Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. remained unresolved as Mylan had appealed the 2023 ruling, with oral arguments held in February 2025."

      "question": "How did BMY's operational presence in Switzerland in 2022 influence its ability to leverage Project Orbis regulatory pathways by 2024, and what impact did this have on the approval timeline for oncology drugs like Opdivo in international markets?",
      "answer": "BMY's operational presence in Switzerland in 2022, particularly through its Revlimid and Thalomid manufacturing facility in Zofingen, positioned the company to benefit from Switzerland's participation in Project Orbis\u2014a global collaborative review program for oncology drugs. By 2024, this strategic alignment enabled BMY to accelerate regulatory approvals for oncology products like Opdivo in international markets. For instance, under Project Orbis, earlier approvals were granted by the Australian TGA, Health Canada, and the UK\u2019s MHRA in 2022 for Opdivo in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, which directly contributed to the FDA approval in March 2022\u2014four months ahead of the priority review PDUFA date. This demonstrates how BMY\u2019s Swiss operations in 2022 facilitated faster global regulatory alignment and expedited market access by 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BMY(2022) \u2192 Switzerland: BMY operated a key manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland, producing active ingredients for Revlimid and Thalomid, indicating a strong operational footprint in the country.",
        "Hop 2: Switzerland \u2192 Project Orbis: Switzerland was one of the countries participating in Project Orbis, a global collaborative regulatory initiative that allowed for concurrent review of oncology applications, as seen with Trodelvy's approval in 2021.",
        "Hop 3: Project Orbis \u2190 BMY(2024): By 2024, BMY leveraged Project Orbis to accelerate approvals for Opdivo combinations, with earlier international approvals facilitating faster FDA review and market access."

          "chunk_text": "## Manufacturing and Quality Assurance\n\nWe operate and manage a manufacturing network, consisting of internal and external resources, in a manner that permits us to improve efficiency while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity. Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Given that shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy  process  requiring  significant  capital  and  other  expenditures  as  well  as  regulatory  approvals,  we  manage  and  operate  a flexible manufacturing network that minimizes unnecessary product transfers and inefficient uses of manufacturing capacity. For further discussion of the regulatory impact on our manufacturing, refer to '-Government Regulation' above.\n\nOur significant biologics, cell therapy and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Ireland and Switzerland and require significant ongoing capital investment for both maintenance and compliance with increasing regulatory requirements.  For  example,  the  FDA  approved  our  large  scale  multi-product  bulk  biologics  manufacturing  facility  in  Devens, Massachusetts  in  May  2012  and  we  continue  to  make  capital  investments  in  this  facility.  In  addition,  we  expect  to  continue modification  of  our  existing  manufacturing  network  to  meet  complex  processing  standards  that  are  required  for  our  growing portfolio,  particularly  biologics  and  cell  therapy.  Biologics  manufacturing  involves  more  complex  processes  than  those  of traditional  pharmaceutical  operations.  For  example,  we  completed  our  new  large-scale  biologics  manufacturing  facility  in Cruiserath,  Ireland,  which  was  approved  by  the  FDA  in  December  2019  and  by  the  EU  in  January  2020.  For  our  cell  therapy product candidates and marketed products, including Breyanzi and Abecma , we have invested in our own manufacturing network, including facilities in Bothell, Washington; Summit, New Jersey; and Devens, Massachusetts, as well as third-party manufacturers. Beyond  regulatory  requirements,  many  of  our  products  involve  technically  sophisticated  manufacturing  processes  or  require specialized raw materials. For example, we manufacture for clinical and commercial use several sterile products, biologic products and CAR T products, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. As a result, even slight deviations at any point in their production process may lead to production failures or recalls.\n\nIn addition to our own manufacturing sites, we rely on third parties to manufacture or supply us with all or a portion of the active product ingredient or drug substance necessary for us to manufacture various products, such as Opdivo , Eliquis, Sprycel , Yervoy, Reblozyl, Inrebic, Abraxane, and Pomalyst/Imnovid. We are also expanding our use of third-party manufacturers for drug product and finished goods manufacturing and we continue to shift towards using third-party manufacturers for supply of our mature and other brands . With respect to Revlimid and Thalomid \u00ae, we own and operate a manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland, in which we produce the active product ingredient for Revlimid and Thalomid and  we  contract  with  a  third-party  manufacturer  to provide the back-up active product ingredient for Revlimid and Thalomid . To maintain a stable supply of these products, we take a variety of actions including inventory management and maintenance of additional quantities of materials, when possible, that are designed  to  provide  for  a  reasonable  level  of  these  ingredients  to  be  held  by  the  third-party  supplier,  us  or  both,  so  that  our manufacturing operations are not interrupted. Certain supply arrangements extend over multiple years with committed amounts using expected near or long-term demand requirements that are subject to change. As an additional protection, in some cases, we take  steps  to  maintain  an  approved  back-up  source  where  available  and  when  needed.  For  example,  we  have  the  capability  to manufacture Opdivo internally and have arrangements with third-party manufacturers to meet demand.\n\nIn connection with acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and collaboration arrangements or distribution agreements for certain of our products, or in certain other circumstances, we have entered into agreements under which we have agreed to supply our products to third parties and intend to continue to enter into such arrangements or agreements in the future. In addition to liabilities that could arise from our failure to supply such products under the agreements, these arrangements or agreements could require us to invest in facilities  for  the  manufacturing  of  non-strategic  products,  in  the  case  of  a  divestiture  or  distribution  arrangement,  resulting  in additional regulatory filings and obligations or causing an interruption in the manufacturing of our own strategic products.\n\nOur success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support  their  safety  and  effectiveness.  Product  quality  arises  from  a  total  commitment  to  quality  in  all  parts  of  our  operations, including research and development, purchasing, facilities maintenance and planning, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics and distribution. We maintain records to demonstrate the quality and integrity of data, technical information and production processes.\n\nControl  of  production  processes  involves  established  specifications  and  standards  for  raw  materials,  components,  ingredients, equipment and facilities,  manufacturing methods and operations, packaging materials and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes, on the raw materials, drug substance and the final product and on product samples held on stability to  ensure  that  the  product  meets  regulatory  requirements  and  conforms to our standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical analyses, microbiological testing or a combination of these along with other analyses. Quality control testing is provided by  business  unit/site  and  third-party  laboratories.  Quality  assurance  groups  routinely  monitor  manufacturing  procedures  and systems used by us, our subsidiaries and third-party suppliers to ensure quality and compliance requirements are met.",

          "chunk_text": "In many markets outside the U.S., we operate in an environment of government-mandated, cost-containment programs. In these markets, a significant portion of funding for healthcare services and the determination of pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products are subject to either direct government control at the point of care or governments serving as the primary payer. As a result, our products may face restricted access and pricing pressures by both public and private payers and may be subject to assessments of comparative value and effectiveness against existing standard of care. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and/or enacted mandated price cuts or rebate schemes as methods of cost control. In most EU countries, for ex ample, the government regulates pricing of a new product at launch often through direct price controls, international price comparisons, and/or reference pricing to the current standard of care. Prices are often reevaluated and further restricted throughout the life of the medicine. In other EU markets, such as Germany, the government does not set pricing restrictions at launch, but pricing freedom is subsequently limited. Companies may also face significant delays in market access for new products and more than a year can elapse before new medicines become available to patients in the market. Additionally, countries outside of the U.S. have regularly imposed new or additional cost containment measures for pharmaceuticals such as volume discounts, cost caps, cost sharing for increases in ex cess of prior year costs for individual products or aggregated market level spending and clawbacks. These trends have been accelerating in recent years. For example, in 2022, G ermany reformed its pricing and reimbursement system to further restrain pharmaceutical spending by reducing its 'free pricing' period and introducing new cost-containment measures on medicines based on their value assessment results, and use in combination with other medicines, and more. The Japanese government continues to impose price cuts outside the normal repricing cycles, and in the last several years introduced a new value assessment requirement on some medicines to further cut prices. The existence of price differentials between markets, particularly among neighboring countries, due to the different national pricing and reimbursement conditions leads to potential parallel trade flows.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive global regulations by regional, country, state and local agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, other Federal statutes and regulations, various state statutes and regulations (including newly enacted state laws regulating drug price transparency, rebates and drug spending), and laws and regulations of foreign governments govern to varying degrees the testing, approval, production, labeling, distribution, post-market surveillance,  advertising,  dissemination  of  information  and  promotion  of  our  products.  The  lengthy  process  of  laboratory  and  clinical  testing,  data  analysis, manufacturing,  development  and  regulatory  review  necessary  for  required  governmental  approvals  is  extremely  costly  and  can  significantly  delay  product introductions in a given market. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major world markets. In addition, our operations are subject to complex Federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations. We anticipate that the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort, time and ex pense as well as significant capital investments.\n\nThe  FDA  is  of  particular  importance  in  the  U.S.  It  has  jurisdiction  over  virtually  all  of  our  activities  and  imposes  requirements  covering  the  testing,  safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and post-marketing surveillance of our products. In many cases, FDA requirements have increased the amount  of  time  and  money  necessary  to  develop  new  products  and  bring  them  to  market  in  the  U.S.  The  regulatory  review  process  is  a  resource  intensive undertaking for both the FDA and the pharmaceutical company. Improvements in the efficiency of this process can have significant impact on bringing new therapies to patients more quickly. The FDA can employ several tools to facilitate the development of certain drugs or expedite certain applications, including fast track designation,  Breakthrough  Therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, incentives for orphan drugs developed for rare diseases and others.  For example, in recent years the FDA OCE established two projects to test novel approaches for more efficient regulatory review of oncology drugs: the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program and the Assessment Aid. Under the Assessment Aid pilot program, the FDA approved Opdivo given with three cycles of platinumdoublet chemotherapy on March 4, 2022 for the first-line treatment of adult patients with resectable NSCLC in the neoadjuvant setting. This approval was achieved four months before the priority review PDUFA date in July 2022. To develop a framework for concurrent review of supplemental oncology applications among multiple approval authorities, the OCE initiated Project Orbis. Under Project Orbis, earlier approvals from the Australian Therapeutic G oods Administration ('TGA'), Health Canada and the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency were received on the combination of Opdivo given with three cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount primarily reflects $500 million of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. (a)\n\nThe decrease is primarily due to amortization, partially offset by the capitalization of the Comirnaty milestones described above. (b)\n\n## Developed Technology Rights\n\nDeveloped technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\n\n## Brands\n\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\n\n## IPR&amp;D\n\nIPR&amp;D assets represent R&amp;D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

      "question": "How did Amgen's strategic use of orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. in 2023 influence its market exclusivity approach for BLINCYTO in the EU in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Amgen leveraged the U.S. orphan drug exclusivity framework, which grants 7 years of exclusivity for drugs treating rare diseases, to protect products like TEPEZZA and UPLIZNA. This regulatory strategy likely informed Amgen's approach in 2024, where it pursued orphan medicinal product designation in the EU for BLINCYTO, which provides 10 years of market exclusivity for approved orphan indications across all EU member states. The shift from a 7-year U.S. exclusivity model to a 10-year EU model demonstrates Amgen\u2019s tailored regulatory strategy to maximize market protection by region, leveraging specific provisions in both jurisdictions to maintain competitive advantage for BLINCYTO.",

          "chunk_text": "## Regulation outside the United States\n\nIn EU countries as well as in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States.\n\nIn the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure , identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies.  Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment-based on safety, quality and efficacy-is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure , which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA's CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally follows the CHMP's opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval.\n\nIn the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, an applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired, relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is 'highly similar' with regard to quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future .\n\nIn the EU, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, provides that a medicine can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the EC if its sponsor can establish that: (i) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (ii) either (a) such conditions affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the EU, or even if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. An application for the designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product may be submitted at any stage of development of the medicinal product but before the filing of an MAA. A marketing authorization for an orphan medicinal product may only include indications  designated as orphan.  For non-orphan indications treated with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, a separate marketing authorization has to be sought. Approved orphan drugs in the EU receive 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication in all EU member states. We currently have orphan medicinal product designation for BLINCYTO in the EU and intend to seek medicinal product designation for a number of our products in the future.\n\nOther countries such as those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical-trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, regulatory timelines can be less predictable.  The  regulatory  process  may  also  include  manufacturing/testing  facility  inspections,  testing  of  drug  product  upon  importation  and  other  domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that would allow for submissions under more-competitive time frames. With regard to biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea).\n\nIn some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby manufacturers must establish that their medical devices conform to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements.",

      "question": "How did the changes in CMS Innovation Center model participation requirements between 2023 and 2024 affect Oak Street Health's ability to achieve shared savings, and what does this imply for CVS's strategic integration of value-based care models?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVS highlighted Oak Street Health's expected growth as part of its strategic expansion into value-based care. However, by 2024, the company disclosed increasing regulatory and operational risks tied to CMS Innovation Center models like ACO REACH, including annual payment benchmark reductions and lack of long-term model continuity. These changes directly impacted Oak Street Health's ability to reliably achieve shared savings, as CMS adjustments made it harder to predict and capture cost savings. This evolution suggests that CVS's integration of value-based care models faces growing uncertainty due to shifting CMS policies, potentially affecting the long-term ROI of its Oak Street Health acquisition.",

      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb's 2022 strategic expansion into CRC, including the development of Opdivo in combination regimens and new tumor types, laid the foundation for broader clinical investigation of Opdivo across solid tumors. This included the advancement of Opdivo in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine, which culminated in its FDA approval in March 2024 for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The 2022 filing explicitly mentioned the expansion of Opdivo into new tumors and combination approaches, which aligns with the 2024 approval that reflects the successful clinical development trajectory supported by the company\u2019s earlier strategic focus.",

          "chunk_text": "We are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (i) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types; (ii) hematology with opportunities to broaden our franchise and potentially sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma; (iii) immunology with priorities in relapsing multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, RA and inflammatory bowel disease; (iv)  cardiovascular  disease  and;  (v)  fibrotic  disease  with  priorities  in  lung  and  liver.  We  continue  to  advance  the  next  wave  of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business development activities. We have  expanded  our  oncology,  hematology  and  immunology  portfolios  with  several  near-term  assets  and  additional  external partnerships.  We  have  invested  in  our  oncology  portfolio  by  pursuing  both  monotherapy  and  combination  approaches  and advancing our next wave of early assets and to explore new collaboration opportunities across our therapeutic areas of focus. We remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of Opdivo in earlier lines of therapy,  expand  into  new  tumors,  accelerate  next  wave  oncology  mechanisms  and  develop  treatment  options  for  refractory oncology patients. We are further strengthening our IO portfolio with another opportunity of relatlimab in a fixed dose combination with  nivolumab  for  the  treatment  of  melanoma  and  expanded  opportunities  in  adjuvant  melanoma,  lung,  liver  and  CRC.  For hematology, we have opportunities to launch several new medicines in the near-term with additional pipeline opportunities in the longer term. There is a broad effort to continue to address the unmet medical need in multiple myeloma and we are working across multiple  modalities  and  mechanisms  of  action  such  as  cereblon  modulators  ('CELMoDs'),  T-cell  Engagers  and  CAR  T-cell therapies.\n\nBeyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunology, cardiovascular and neuroscience diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. We believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines.  For  immunology  with  deucravacitinib,  our  selective  TYK2,  there  is  opportunity  to  be  a  medicine  that  could  treat multiple immune-mediated diseases. The FDA has accepted our NDA for deucravacitinib for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and has set a PDUFA goal date of September 10, 2022. We are expanding our portfolio for cardiovascular disease with our alliance partnership with Janssen where we are advancing a next-generation antithrombotic medicine in milvexian. Additionally,  through  the  acquisition  of  MyoKardia,  we  have  added  mavacamten,  which  has  the  potential  to  be  a  first-in-class medicine to treat the underlying cause of obstructive HCM. The FDA has accepted the NDA for mavacamten for this indication and assigned a revised PDUFA goal date of April 28, 2022.\n\nOur commercial model has been successful with revenues from our key brands continuing to grow, which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. We continue to drive adoption of Opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class  clinical  profile  and  extensive  real  world  data  and  is  now  the  number  one  novel  oral  anticoagulant  in  total  prescriptions globally. Revlimid and Pomalyst have  not  only  transformed  the  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma,  but  as  we  gained  deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of Revlimid and Pomalyst ,  we  have leveraged that knowledge to intentionally design novel CELMoD agents, iberdomide and CC-92480, to improve upon these earlier treatments. We are able to leverage our leading capabilities  in  hematological  malignancies  and  our  robust  pipeline  to  provide  opportunities  for  long-term  growth  to  offset  the impact of future patent expires for Revlimid and Pomalyst . We are building on the continued success of our other key brands and remain strongly committed to Orencia and Sprycel .  We  are  also  optimistic  on  the  future  growth  and  near-term  opportunities  of Reblozyl , Inrebic , Zeposia , Onureg , Breyanzi and Abecma .  Through  our  operating  model  transformation,  our  commercial infrastructure is leveraged for potential growth.\n\nWe expect the growth in our in-line and new product portfolio will enable us to more than offset the expected decline in Revlimid, Abraxane and other products revenues due to their loss of market exclusivity through 2025.\n\nOur operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial, R&amp;D and manufacturing resources on key brands and markets, strengthening our R&amp;D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. The evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in  the  highest  priority  opportunities  within  our  portfolio. Through  our  Celgene  acquisition  restructuring  activities,  we  expect  to realize approximately $3.0 billion of synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance through 2022 and our integration efforts across  general  and  administrative,  manufacturing,  R&amp;D,  procurement  and  streamlining  the  Company's  pricing  and  information technology infrastructure.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of key brands, executing product launches,  investing  in  our  diverse  and  innovative  pipeline,  aided  by  strategic  business  development,  focusing  on  prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.",

      "question": "How did BMY's strategic focus on expanding Opdivo's indications in lung cancer in 2022 translate into new therapeutic applications or commercial growth for Opdivo by 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY emphasized expanding Opdivo\u2019s use in lung cancer through earlier lines of therapy and new tumor types, both as monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other agents. By 2023, this strategy had progressed to include a subcutaneous formulation of Opdivo with positive registrational data, and the company continued to drive adoption by expanding into additional indications and tumor types. This reflects a direct translation of earlier R&D focus into tangible product development and commercial expansion for Opdivo in lung cancer treatment.",

          "chunk_text": "We are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (i) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types; (ii) hematology with opportunities to broaden our franchise and potentially sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma; (iii) immunology with priorities in relapsing multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, RA and inflammatory bowel disease; (iv)  cardiovascular  disease  and;  (v)  fibrotic  disease  with  priorities  in  lung  and  liver.  We  continue  to  advance  the  next  wave  of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business development activities. We have  expanded  our  oncology,  hematology  and  immunology  portfolios  with  several  near-term  assets  and  additional  external partnerships.  We  have  invested  in  our  oncology  portfolio  by  pursuing  both  monotherapy  and  combination  approaches  and advancing our next wave of early assets and to explore new collaboration opportunities across our therapeutic areas of focus. We remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of Opdivo in earlier lines of therapy,  expand  into  new  tumors,  accelerate  next  wave  oncology  mechanisms  and  develop  treatment  options  for  refractory oncology patients. We are further strengthening our IO portfolio with another opportunity of relatlimab in a fixed dose combination with  nivolumab  for  the  treatment  of  melanoma  and  expanded  opportunities  in  adjuvant  melanoma,  lung,  liver  and  CRC.  For hematology, we have opportunities to launch several new medicines in the near-term with additional pipeline opportunities in the longer term. There is a broad effort to continue to address the unmet medical need in multiple myeloma and we are working across multiple  modalities  and  mechanisms  of  action  such  as  cereblon  modulators  ('CELMoDs'),  T-cell  Engagers  and  CAR  T-cell therapies.\n\nBeyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunology, cardiovascular and neuroscience diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. We believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines.  For  immunology  with  deucravacitinib,  our  selective  TYK2,  there  is  opportunity  to  be  a  medicine  that  could  treat multiple immune-mediated diseases. The FDA has accepted our NDA for deucravacitinib for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and has set a PDUFA goal date of September 10, 2022. We are expanding our portfolio for cardiovascular disease with our alliance partnership with Janssen where we are advancing a next-generation antithrombotic medicine in milvexian. Additionally,  through  the  acquisition  of  MyoKardia,  we  have  added  mavacamten,  which  has  the  potential  to  be  a  first-in-class medicine to treat the underlying cause of obstructive HCM. The FDA has accepted the NDA for mavacamten for this indication and assigned a revised PDUFA goal date of April 28, 2022.\n\nOur commercial model has been successful with revenues from our key brands continuing to grow, which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. We continue to drive adoption of Opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class  clinical  profile  and  extensive  real  world  data  and  is  now  the  number  one  novel  oral  anticoagulant  in  total  prescriptions globally. Revlimid and Pomalyst have  not  only  transformed  the  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma,  but  as  we  gained  deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of Revlimid and Pomalyst ,  we  have leveraged that knowledge to intentionally design novel CELMoD agents, iberdomide and CC-92480, to improve upon these earlier treatments. We are able to leverage our leading capabilities  in  hematological  malignancies  and  our  robust  pipeline  to  provide  opportunities  for  long-term  growth  to  offset  the impact of future patent expires for Revlimid and Pomalyst . We are building on the continued success of our other key brands and remain strongly committed to Orencia and Sprycel .  We  are  also  optimistic  on  the  future  growth  and  near-term  opportunities  of Reblozyl , Inrebic , Zeposia , Onureg , Breyanzi and Abecma .  Through  our  operating  model  transformation,  our  commercial infrastructure is leveraged for potential growth.\n\nWe expect the growth in our in-line and new product portfolio will enable us to more than offset the expected decline in Revlimid, Abraxane and other products revenues due to their loss of market exclusivity through 2025.\n\nOur operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial, R&amp;D and manufacturing resources on key brands and markets, strengthening our R&amp;D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. The evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in  the  highest  priority  opportunities  within  our  portfolio. Through  our  Celgene  acquisition  restructuring  activities,  we  expect  to realize approximately $3.0 billion of synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance through 2022 and our integration efforts across  general  and  administrative,  manufacturing,  R&amp;D,  procurement  and  streamlining  the  Company's  pricing  and  information technology infrastructure.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of key brands, executing product launches,  investing  in  our  diverse  and  innovative  pipeline,  aided  by  strategic  business  development,  focusing  on  prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AbbVie's collaboration with Janssen Biotech involved a cost-sharing model where Janssen covered 60% of development costs and AbbVie covered 40%. However, in 2024, the financial performance of Imbruvica was significantly impacted when the U.S. government included Imbruvica in the list of products subject to price controls under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This led AbbVie to record a $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge for Imbruvica in Q3 2023, reflecting a sharp decline in its projected future cash flows. This impairment suggests that despite the cost-sharing benefits from the collaboration, external regulatory changes had a dominant negative impact on the product's financial outlook, altering the earlier economic benefit expected from the Janssen partnership.",

The intangible assets will be amortized using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the acquisitions.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the company made a decision to reduce current sales and marketing investment related to both CoolSculpting, a body contouring technology for aesthetic nonsurgical fat reduction, and Liletta, an on-market women's health product. Each of these strategic decisions contributed to significant decreases in the estimated future cash flows for the respective products and represented triggering events that required an evaluation of the underlying definite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The company used a discounted cash flow analysis for both products. For CoolSculpting, the fair value of $290 million was lower than the carrying value of $1.3 billion resulting in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. For Liletta, the fair value of $241 million was lower than the carrying value of $561 million resulting in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.4 billion to costs of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn August 2023, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the company's oncology product Imbruvica sold in the United States (U.S.) was included on the l i s t of products subject to government-set prices by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. The selection resulted in a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite-lived intangible asset for i mpairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of $1.9 billion, which was lower than the carrying value of $4.0 billion and resulted in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount as of August 29, 2023. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.1 billion to cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn September 2022, the company made a strategic decision to reduce ongoing sales and marketing investment related to Vuity, an on-market product to treat presbyopia. This strategic decision contributed to a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite lived-intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the intangible asset resulting in a full impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $770 million to cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022.\n\nFair value measurements for the above evaluations were based on Level 3 inputs including estimated net revenues, cost of products sold, R&amp;D costs, selling and marketing costs and discount rate.\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $7.6 billion in 2024, $7.9 billion in 2023 and $7.7 billion in 2022 and was included i n cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the redesign of Medicare Part D under the IRA, which began in 2024, impact CVS's ability to forecast and manage health care benefit costs in 2024 compared to 2022, particularly in light of the new manufacturer discount obligations and capped out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS was subject to Medicare Part D regulations and expressed uncertainty about its ability to recoup increased costs from regulatory changes, including those related to mandated coverage or benefits, through higher premiums or expanded membership. By 2024, under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and shift more financial responsibility to Part D plans and manufacturers, including requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs. This change, combined with the IRA\u2019s mechanism for collecting rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation, directly affected CVS's health plan cost structure and forecasting accuracy. In 2024, CVS noted that regulatory changes\u2014including those from the IRA\u2014added complexity to forecasting health care benefit costs, which are based on projections made months in advance and are sensitive to external factors like drug pricing and utilization trends. The redesign of Medicare Part D under the IRA thus introduced new financial pressures and forecasting challenges for CVS in 2024 that were not present in 2022, particularly in managing drug costs and predicting rebate obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nthe Company and other health plans to expanded liability for punitive and other extra-contractual damages and additional state regulation.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the Company can counter the potential adverse effects of such potential legislation or regulation on its operating results or cash flows, including whether it can recoup, through higher premium rates, expanded membership or other measures, the increased costs of mandated coverage or benefits, assessments, fees, taxes or other increased costs, including the cost of modifying its systems to implement any enacted legislation or regulations.\n\nThe Company's businesses also may be affected by other legislation and regulations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act creates incentives for whistleblowers to speak directly to the government rather than utilizing internal compliance programs and reduces the burden of proof under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the 'FCPA'). There also are laws and regulations that set standards for the escheatment of funds to states.\n\nHealth savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending accounts and certain of the tax, fee and subsidy provisions of the ACA also are regulated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe Company also may be adversely affected by court and regulatory decisions that expand or revise the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or impose medical malpractice or bad faith liability. Federal and state courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, continue to consider cases, and federal and state regulators continue to issue regulations and interpretations, addressing bad faith liability for denial of medical claims, the scope of ERISA's fiduciary duty requirements, the scope of the False Claims Act and the pre-emptive effect of ERISA and Medicare Part D on state laws.\n\nContract Audits - The Company is subject to audits of many of its contracts, including its PBM client contracts, its PBM rebate contracts, its PBM network contracts, its contracts relating to Medicare Advantage and/or Medicare Part D, the agreements the Company's pharmacies enter into with other payors, its Medicaid contracts and its customer contracts. Because some of the Company's contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies, audits of these contracts are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs, including those which operate Medicaid fee for service plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare Part D plans or Medicare Advantage organizations.\n\nFederal Employee Health Benefits Program - The Company's subsidiaries contract with the Office of Personnel Management (the 'OPM') to provide managed health care services under the FEHB program in their service areas. These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program. In addition to other requirements, such as the Transparency in Coverage Rule note above, OPM regulations require that community-rated FEHB plans meet a FEHB program-specific minimum MLR by plan code and market. Managing to these rules is complicated by the simultaneous application of the minimum MLR standards and associated premium rebate requirements of the ACA. The Company also has a contractual arrangement with carriers for the FEHB program, such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal workers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the FEHB Act and as part of the FEHB program. Additionally, the Company manages certain FEHB plans on a 'cost-plus' basis. These arrangements subject the Company to certain aspects of the FEHB Act, and other federal regulations, such as the FEHB Acquisition Regulation, that otherwise would not be applicable to the Company. The OPM also is auditing the Company and its other contractors to, among other things, verify that plans meet their applicable FEHB programspecific MLR and the premiums established under the OPM's Insured contracts and costs allocated pursuant to the OPM's costbased contracts are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable FEHB program. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against the Company if it fails to comply with the FEHB program requirements.\n\nClinical Services Regulation - The Company provides clinical services to health plans, PBMs and providers for a variety of complex and common medical conditions, including arranging for certain members to participate in disease management programs. State laws regulate the practice of medicine, the practice of pharmacy, the practice of nursing and certain other clinical activities. Clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of clinical services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice.\n\nThird Party Administration and Other State Licensure Laws - Many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations, such as PPOs, TPAs and companies that provide utilization review services. Several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs (also known as cash card or discount card programs).",

          "chunk_text": "ENBREL's profitability in Medicare. In January 2025, CMS announced the next 15 drugs for Medicare price setting that will be applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, which includes Otezla. Also under the IRA, starting on January 1, 2024, Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning on January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance will become reduced in the catastrophic phase (resulting in a shift and increase of such costs to Part D plans and manufacturers, including by requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs). Further, the IRA created a mechanism for CMS to collect rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation. We began to accrue for rebate obligations on October 1, 2022 for Medicare Part D and on January 1, 2023 for Medicare Part B.\n\nOther potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; increasing transparency in drug pricing; using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices; referencing foreign prices; and changes to government rebate programs. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida to move forward with its importation program proposal, which excludes biologics. CMS also issued a proposed Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rule that would have required manufacturers to aggregate or 'stack' all rebates, discounts or other price concessions made to separate, unrelated entities across the pharmaceutical supply chain on a given unit of product to determine the 'Best Price,' a metric that is used to determine Medicaid rebates and 340B statutory rates. This proposal was not finalized but remains a policy that could be reconsidered in the future. Further, at the state level, eight states (Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish PDABs to identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and in four states (Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington) include authority for the state PDAB to set upper payment limits on certain drugs for in-state patients, payers and providers.\n\nIn  many  countries  other  than  the  United  States,  government-sponsored  healthcare  systems  are  the  primary  payers  for  drugs  and  biologics.  With  increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in rebates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many governments use health technology assessment organizations to judge the added benefit of new treatments over existing ones, metrics which are then used to set reimbursement prices and/or set coverage limits. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that governments will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The EU is currently undergoing a review and revision of its pharmaceutical legislation. Various proposals are under consideration with the EU Council, followed by a negotiation among the EU government to agree to a final law. Full implementation is not expected until 2027 or later. The new legislation, if implemented, will likely have a significant impact on the landscape for access and pricing decisions within EU Member States.\n\nThe dynamics and developments discussed above create pressures on the pricing and potential usage of our products and on the industry. G iven the diverse interests  in  play  between  payers,  biopharmaceutical  manufacturers,  policy  makers,  healthcare  providers  and  independent  organizations,  if  and  whether  the  parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:\n\n- investing billions of dollars annually in R&amp;D;\n- pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;\n- developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;\n- partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;\n- providing patient support and education programs;\n- helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and\n- working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and in which patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.\n\nSee  Item  1A.

There can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.\n\nPremiums for our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which comprised 94% of our Health Care Benefits segment revenues for 2024, are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fix ed premium period, which is generally twelve months. These forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins, are influenced by historical data (and recent historical data in particular), are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members' behavior and health care utilization patterns and medical claim submission patterns and require a significant degree of judgment. For example, our revenue on Individual Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June of the year before the contract year. Cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we ex pect to incur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. During periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical costs trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic, accurately detecting, forecasting, managing, reserving and pricing for our (and our self-insured customers') medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging. There can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing, and whether our health care and other benefit costs will be affected by pandemics, disease outbreaks and other external events over which we have no control. Even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment's operating results.\n\nWhile the public health emergency related to COVID-19 expired in May 2023, COVID-19 still exists and it may, like many other respiratory viruses, wax and wane depending on geography and seasonality. The future impact COVID-19 will have on the Company and its ability to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs is uncertain, and will depend on geographies impacted, whether new variants emerge and their severity, the availability and costs of testing, vaccination and treatment, and legal and regulatory actions. COVID-19 may also impact provider behavior, utilization trends, membership, and overall economic conditions. These impacts could be adverse and material.\n\nA number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs, including previously uninsured members entering the health care system; Medicare members' utilization of supplemental benefits; other changes in members' behavior, health care utilization patterns and utilization management; turnover in our membership, health care provider and member fraud; additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, including changes to or as a result of the ACA and IRA; changes in the health status of our members; the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics; advances in medical technology; increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies); direct-to-consumer marketing by drug manufacturers; the increasing influence of social media on our members' health care utilization and other behaviors; the shift to a consumer-driven business model; changes in health care practices and general economic conditions (such as inflation and employment levels); increases in labor costs; pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks; influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we expected); clusters of high-cost cases; natural disasters and extreme weather events (which may increase in frequency or intensity as a result of climate change); and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control. For example, the length and severity of the influenza season can have an impact on health care and other benefit costs. In 2022-2023 influenza season had an earlier than average start, including as compared to the 2023-2024 influenza season; the 2020-2021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and the 2019-2020 influenza season maintained a high level of severity for a longer period of time than average. In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this issue.\n\nOur Health Care Benefits segment's operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Merck had accrued $600 million in sales-based milestone payments to Eisai for Lenvima, with potential future payments of $2.6 billion not yet accrued. By 2024, Merck's alliance revenue from Lenvima reached $1,010 million, indicating that the collaboration had matured and generated significant returns. This suggests that the earlier milestone payments were part of a strategic investment in the partnership, which translated into measurable revenue growth by 2024.",

In  addition,  the  agreement provides  for  contingent  payments  from  Merck  to  Eisai  related  to  the  successful  achievement  of  sales-based  and  regulatory milestones. Merck made sales-based milestone payments to Eisai aggregating $200 million, $500 million and $50 million in 2021, 2020  and  2019,  respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  sales-based  milestone  payments  accrued  but  not  yet  paid  totaled $600 million. Potential future sales-based milestone payments of $2.6 billion have not yet been accrued as they are not deemed by the Company to be probable at this time.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, Lenvima received regulatory approvals triggering capitalized milestone payments of $75 million and $10 million, respectively, from Merck to Eisai. As of December 31, 2021, a regulatory approval milestone payment of $25 million was accrued but not yet paid. Potential future regulatory milestone payments of $25 million remain under the agreement.\n\nThe  intangible  asset  balance  related  to  Lenvima  (which  includes  capitalized  sales-based  and  regulatory  milestone payments) was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and is included in Other Intangibles, Net . The amount is being amortized over its estimated useful life through 2026 as supported by projected future cash flows, subject to impairment testing.\n\nSummarized financial information related to this collaboration is as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did GILD's regulatory strategy for Bulevirtide evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of its Breakthrough Therapy designation and projected market exclusivity timelines?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GILD's Bulevirtide was under the Breakthrough Therapy designation, indicating that the FDA recognized its potential as a significant treatment for chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection and was expediting its development and review. However, approval was pending due to unresolved manufacturing and delivery concerns cited in a complete response letter from October 2022. By 2023, despite these unresolved issues, Bulevirtide was listed with an expected U.S. exclusivity period through 2030 and in the EU through 2029, suggesting that GILD had made progress in addressing regulatory concerns or had secured interim exclusivity protections. This evolution reflects a strategic shift from regulatory expedited status to a more defined commercialization timeline, even in the absence of final approval.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GILD(2022) \u2192 Breakthrough Therapy Designation: GILD had a drug candidate (Bulevirtide) under Breakthrough Therapy status, with FDA expedited development due to its potential to treat HDV, though approval was pending due to manufacturing and delivery concerns.",
        "Hop 2: Breakthrough Therapy Designation \u2192 Bulevirtide: Bulevirtide was granted both Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations by the FDA, with a Biologics License Application (BLA) filed, but approval was delayed due to a complete response letter issued in October 2022.",
        "Hop 3: Bulevirtide \u2190 GILD(2023): By 2023, Bulevirtide was listed with U.S. exclusivity until 2030 and EU exclusivity until 2029, indicating that despite unresolved FDA concerns, GILD had secured a defined commercialization pathway."

          "chunk_text": "At any point in this process, the development of a drug candidate can be stopped for a number of reasons, including safety concerns,  lack  of  treatment  benefit  or  manufacturing  issues.  We  cannot  be  certain  that  any  clinical  trials  that  we  are  currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or  FDA  may  require  us,  to  delay  or  suspend  our  clinical  trials  at  any  time  if  it  appears  that  patients  are  being  exposed  to  an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit.\n\nEven  after  approving  a  drug,  FDA  may  also  require  Phase  4  non-registrational  studies  to  explore  scientific  questions  to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of our drug. FDA may also require us to provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our filing does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefits of the drug. In addition, even if FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we are complying with regulatory standards or if concerns about the safety or efficacy are uncovered or occur after approval.\n\nIn addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for any drug we sell, including those of companies who manufacture our drugs for us. All of these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by FDA. FDA must also approve foreign establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the United States and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection. Our manufacturing facilities located in California also must be licensed by the State of California in compliance with local regulatory requirements. Our manufacturing facilities in Canada, Ireland and Netherlands also must obtain local licenses and permits in compliance with local regulatory requirements.\n\nFDA may employ one of several tools to facilitate and expedite the development and review of a drug, including fast track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, accelerated approval and Priority Review designation. Fast track designation is designed  to  facilitate  the  development  and  review  of  a  drug  that  treats  a  serious  condition  and  fills  an  unmet  medical  need. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of a drug that treats a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates substantial improvement over available therapies. Accelerated approval of a drug may be granted by FDA where the drug treats a serious condition, fills an unmet medical need and has been studied for safety and efficacy. Priority Review designation means FDA's goal is to take action on an application within six months of filing. FDA may grant  Priority  Review  designation  to  a  drug  that  would  provide  significant  improvement  in  the  safety  or  effectiveness  of  a treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition.\n\n## European Union Regulatory System and Approval Process\n\nIn  the  European  Union ('EU'), our products are subject to a variety of EU and EU Member State regulations governing clinical  trials,  commercial  sales  and  distribution. We  are  required  to  obtain  a  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  before  we  can market  our  medicinal  products  on  the  relevant  market.  The  conduct  of  clinical  trials  in  the  EU  is  governed  by,  among  others, Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and the EU (ICH) Good Clinical Practice rules. These impose legal and regulatory obligations that are similar to those provided in applicable U.S. laws. The conduct of clinical trials in the EU must be approved by the competent authorities of each EU Member States in which the clinical trials take place, and a positive opinion must be obtained from  the  relevant  Ethics  Committee  in  the  relevant  Member  State.  In  2014,  the  EU  legislator  adopted  Regulation  (EU)  No 536/2014  to  replace  Directive  2001/20/EC  and  to  introduce  a  coordinated  procedure  for  authorization  of  clinical  trials.  This Regulation entered into application in January 2022.\n\nMarketing authorization holders, manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and distributors of medicinal products placed on the market in the EU are required to comply with a number of regulatory requirements including pharmacovigilance, GMP compliance and the requirement to obtain manufacturing, import and/or distribution licenses issued by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the imposition of civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of marketing or manufacturing authorizations.\n\n## Pricing and Reimbursement\n\nSuccessful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments and medical services in the markets where we sell our products. Government health authorities,  private  health  insurers  and  other  organizations  generally  provide  reimbursement.  In  the  United  States,  the  European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. A significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to substantial discounts from their list prices, including rebates we may be required  to  pay  to  Medicaid  agencies  or  discounts  we  may  be  required  to  pay  to  340B  covered  entities. As  a  result,  the  price increases we implement from time to time on certain products may have a limited effect on our net product sales in certain markets. In addition, standard reimbursement structures may not adequately reimburse for innovative therapies.",

      "question": "How did Merck's strategic valuation of MK-7962 (sotatercept) in 2022 relate to the regulatory exclusivity timeline confirmed in 2023, and what implications does this have for the long-term revenue protection of the drug post-approval?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck valued MK-7962 (sotatercept) at $6.4 billion as part of its in-process research and development (IPR&D) assets, indicating a high strategic priority and expectation for future revenue generation. By 2023, the company confirmed that as a biologic, MK-7962 would be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity upon U.S. approval, with an expected expiration in July 2033. This exclusivity, combined with patents covering the method of treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension set to expire in 2037 (absent patent term extension), provides a clear regulatory framework that supports the earlier high valuation. The alignment of financial investment with regulatory strategy suggests Merck anticipates a protected revenue stream for MK-7962 through at least the early 2030s, reinforcing the long-term strategic importance of the drug in Merck\u2019s portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK(2022) \u2192 MK-7962 (sotatercept): In 2022, MK-7962 was valued at $6.4 billion as part of IPR&D, reflecting Merck\u2019s strategic confidence in its future potential.",
        "Hop 2: MK-7962 (sotatercept) \u2192 Data Exclusivity: As a biologic, MK-7962 is eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity in the U.S., with an expiration date of July 2033, and method-of-treatment patents expiring in 2037.",
        "Hop 3: Data Exclusivity \u2190 MRK(2023): Merck disclosed in 2023 that data exclusivity for MK-7962 had been granted in the U.S., Japan, and the EU, with U.S. exclusivity expiring in 2033, providing a regulatory foundation for revenue protection."

Some of the more significant acquired intangibles, on a net basis, related to human health marketed products (included  in  products  and  product  rights  above)  at  December  31,  2021  include Reblozyl ,  $3.8  billion; Zerbaxa ,  $478  million; Gardasil/Gardasil 9, $191 million; Bridion , $145 million; Dificid , $145 million; Sivextro , $138 million; and Simponi , $101 million. Additionally, the Company had $5.0 billion of net acquired intangibles related to animal health marketed products at December 31, 2021,  of  which  $2.3  billion  relate  primarily  to  trade  names  obtained  through  the  2019  acquisition  of Antelliq  (see  Note  4). At December 31, 2021, IPR&amp;D primarily relates to MK-7962 (sotatercept), $6.4 billion, obtained through the acquisition of Acceleron in 2021 (see Note 4); MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $2.0 billion, obtained through the acquisition of ArQule in 2020 (see below and Note 4); and MK-7264 (gefapixant) $832 million, obtained through the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals in 2016. Some of the more significant net intangible assets included in licenses and other above at December 31, 2021 include Lynparza, $1.1 billion, related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca; Lenvima, $1.0 billion, related to a collaboration with Eisai; Adempas, $806 million related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer;  and  Verquvo,  $68  million,  also  related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer.  See  Note  5  for additional information related to the intangible assets associated with these collaborations.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  recorded  an  impairment  charge  of  $1.6  billion  within Cost  of  sales related  to Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for injection, a combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of certain bacterial infections. In December 2020, the Company temporarily suspended sales of Zerbaxa , and subsequently issued a product recall, following the identification of product sterility issues. The recall constituted a triggering event requiring the evaluation of the Zerbaxa intangible asset for impairment. The Company revised its cash flow forecasts for Zerbaxa utilizing certain assumptions around the return to market timeline and anticipated uptake in sales thereafter. These revised cash flow forecasts indicated that the Zerbaxa intangible  asset  value  was  not  fully  recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best  estimate  of  the  fair  value  of  the  intangible  asset  related  to Zerbaxa that,  when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above. The Company also wrote-off inventory of $120 million to Cost of sales in 2020 related to the Zerbaxa recall. A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nIn 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges related to marketed products and other intangibles of $705 million. Of this amount, $612 million related to Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate), a product for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by designated susceptible Gram-positive organisms. As part of a reorganization and reprioritization of its internal sales force, the Company made the decision to cease promotion of Sivextro in the U.S. market by the end of 2019. This decision resulted in reduced cash flow projections for Sivextro , which indicated that the Sivextro intangible asset value was not fully recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market  participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to Sivextro that, when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above.\n\nIPR&amp;D that  the  Company  acquires  through  business  combinations  represents  the  fair  value  assigned  to  incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. Amounts capitalized as IPR&amp;D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY faced significant competitive pressure as generic alternatives to Eliquis threatened market exclusivity and revenue, with potential patent challenges in the EU and weaker patent protections globally. By 2024, BMY had evolved its relationship with Pfizer into a structured co-promotion and supply agreement, where Pfizer received co-exclusive license rights in exchange for upfront and milestone payments. BMY supplied Eliquis to Pfizer at cost plus a percentage of net sales in certain markets, indicating a strategic shift to leverage Pfizer\u2019s global infrastructure to counteract generic competition. This evolution from a threat of market erosion to a collaborative supply and co-marketing model shows how BMY adapted its strategy to maintain Eliquis' market position through partnership rather than sole ownership.",

          "chunk_text": "generic products, which negatively impacts the protections afforded the Company. Lower-priced generics or biosimilars for BMS biologic products or competing biologics could negatively impact our volumes and prices.\n\nIn  addition,  both  the  U.S.  Congress  and  the  U.S.  FDA  have  taken  steps  to  promote  the  development  and  approval  of generic drugs and biosimilar biologics. For example, in December 2019, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation intended to  facilitate  generic  companies'  access  to  drug  samples.  Section  610  of  the  Further  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act, 2020, provides generic and biosimilar developers a private right of action to obtain sufficient quantities of drug samples from  the  reference  product' s  manufacturer  in  order  to  conduct  testing  necessary  to  obtain  approval  for  generic  or biosimilar products. This law has the potential to have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nThere is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates disclosed in this 2021 Form 10-K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance.\n\n## Certain novel approaches to the treatment of diseases, such as chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T cell therapy, may present significant challenges and risks for us.\n\nThe  development  of  novel  approaches  for  the  treatment  of  diseases,  such  as  our  acquisition  in  November  2019  of Celgene's and Juno's CAR T cell therapy programs, including Breyanzi (liso-cel) and Abecma (ide-cel), presents many new challenges and risks due to the unique nature of genetic modification of patient cells ex vivo using certain viruses to reengineer  these  cells  to  ultimately  treat  diseases,  including  obtaining  regulatory  approval  from  U.S.  FDA  and  other regulatory agencies that have limited experience with the development of cellular therapies involving genetic modification of patient cells; developing and deploying consistent and reliable processes, while limiting contamination, for engineering a patient's cells ex vivo and infusing genetically modified cells back into the patient; developing processes for the safe administration of cellular therapies, including long-term follow-up for patients receiving cellular therapies; and sourcing additional clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our potential CAR T products. The use of reengineered cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by the regulatory, patient or medical communities.\n\nFurther, we may not be able to satisfactorily establish the safety and efficacy or the reliability of these therapies through health  authority  approval,  or  demonstrate  the  potential  advantages  and  side  effects  compared  to  existing  and  future therapies. Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Furthermore, certain payment models could impact the financial feasibility of making CAR T cell therapies available in certain markets or by certain treatment sites, thereby limiting patient access. To date, only a few products  that  involve  the  genetic  modification  of  patient  cells  have  been  approved  for  commercial  sale.  Moreover,  the safety profiles of cellular therapies may adversely influence public perception and may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials, or if approved, of physicians and payers to subscribe to these novel treatment approaches. If we fail to overcome these and other challenges, or if significant adverse events are reported from similar therapies,  our  development  of  these  novel  treatment  approaches  may  be  hampered  or  delayed,  which  could  adversely affect our future anticipated revenues and/or profitability related to these therapeutic programs. In addition, we could also face  difficulties  in  manufacturing  CAR  T  cell  therapies,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  future  anticipated  revenues and/or profitability related to our CAR T cell therapies. See ' -We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.'\n\n## We face intense competition from other manufacturers and expect to see increasing market penetration of lower-priced generic products.\n\nThe future growth of BMS is dependent on the market access, uptake and expansion for marketed brands, new product introductions,  new  indications,  product  extensions  and  co-promotional  activities  with  alliance  partners.  Competition  is keen and as we lose exclusivity for some of our marketed brands lower-priced generic products will increasingly penetrate our  markets.  Generic  challenges  to  our  products  can  also  arise  at  any  time,  and  our  patents  may  not  prevent  the emergence of generic competition for our products. For example, if we receive an adverse litigation decision in a country in the EU where our Eliquis composition of matter patents and related Supplementary Protection Certificates are being challenged (see 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies'), we may not be able to prevent generic apixaban products from being introduced in such country prior to our estimated minimum market exclusivity date. In some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the United States or in the EU; political and social pressure has also pushed legislation and other measures that promote the use  of  generic  and  biosimilar  products.  In  addition,  we  face  competition  from  new  products  entering  the  market, particularly in IO. New products may have (i) lower prices, (ii) superior efficacy (benefit) or safety (risk) profiles (whether actual  or  perceived),  (iii)  technological  advantages  that  may  make  such  products  more  convenient  to  use,  (iv)  better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, (v) more effective marketing programs and/or other differentiating factors that make it harder for our products to compete. We also face intense competition for external partnerships, joint ventures and  acquisition  targets  that  can  help  develop  and  bring  new  products  to  markets.  Business  combinations  among  our competitors and major third-party payers may increase competition",

The upfront payment and any subsequent contingent milestone proceeds are amortized over the expected period of BMS's co-promotion obligation through the market exclusivity period. Both parties assumed certain obligations to actively participate in a joint ex ecutive committee and various other operating committees and have joint responsibilities for the research, development, distribution, sales and marketing activities of the alliance using resources in their own infrastructures.  BMS and  Pfizer manufacture the product in the alliance and BMS is the principal in the end customer product sales in the U.S., significant countries in Europe, as well as Canada, Australia, China, Japan and South Korea. In certain smaller countries, Pfizer has full commercialization rights and BMS supplies the product to Pfizer at cost plus a percentage of the net sales price to end-customers, which is recorded in full upon transfer of control of the product to Pfizer.\n\nSummarized financial information related to this alliance was as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY introduced the CM-9DX trial for Opdivo in adjuvant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indicating early-stage clinical development focus in liver cancer. By 2023, Opdivo was explicitly listed in BMY\u2019s clinical trial table under adjuvant HCC with the CM-9DX trial, showing progression from introduction to active clinical evaluation. Furthermore, in 2023, BMY emphasized broadening Opdivo\u2019s use into earlier lines of therapy and expanding into new tumors, including liver cancer, as part of its strategic focus on oncology beyond traditional IO. This evolution from trial initiation to strategic prioritization reflects a deliberate shift to solidify Opdivo\u2019s role in HCC treatment.",

      "question": "How did MRK's use of Pediatric Exclusivity provisions in 2022 influence their market exclusivity strategy in 2023, particularly regarding the six-month extension mechanism in both U.S. and EU regulatory frameworks?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MRK was subject to Pediatric Exclusivity provisions that allowed for an additional six months of market exclusivity if specific pediatric clinical studies were completed prior to the loss of basic exclusivity. This regulatory mechanism positively impacted MRK's market exclusivity strategy in 2023, as the company strategically leveraged these provisions in both U.S. and EU markets. In the U.S., the six-month extension applied to all Orange Book-listed patents and regulatory data exclusivity terms for small molecule and biologic products, while in the EU, the extension was attached to the Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) term. This enabled MRK to extend the commercial value realization period for key products like new chemical entities and biological products, which otherwise would have faced generic competition after 5 years (U.S. new chemical entity) or 12 years (U.S. biological product) of market exclusivity.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen faced significant payer-driven access restrictions, particularly for Repatha, where high patient out-of-pocket costs led to prescription abandonment, prompting Amgen to reduce Repatha's list price and discontinue the higher-priced option by December 31, 2019. By 2024, Amgen had expanded its approach to include risk-sharing partnerships with payers, biosimilar development, and patient support programs, especially in response to new U.S. policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which introduced manufacturer discounts in the catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D starting in 2025. These strategies were aimed at improving patient access, particularly for ENBREL and Otezla, under evolving reimbursement frameworks. Despite ongoing payer consolidation and pricing pressures, Amgen emphasized responsible pricing, innovation, and collaboration to maintain access to medicines.",

          "chunk_text": "## -U.S. commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products\n\nPayers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from the consolidation of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. With  increasing  frequency,  payers  are  adopting  benefit  plan  changes  that  shift  a  greater  proportion  of  drug  costs  to  patients.  Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and more significant  limitations  on  patients'  use  of  manufacturer  commercial  copay  assistance  programs.  Further,  government  regulation  of payers may affect these trends. For example, CMS finalized a policy in May 2020 (for plan years starting on or after January 1, 2021, and  remains  standing  policy  for  2022)  that  has  caused  commercial  payers  to  more  widely  adopt  copay  accumulator  adjustment programs. Payers have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their  formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as Step Therapy, or requiring that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mailorder  pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies. Payers have also chosen to exclude certain  indications  for  which  our  products  are  approved  or  chosen  to  exclude  coverage  entirely.  For  example,  some  payers  require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria,  and  these  requirements  have  limited,  and  may  continue  to  limit,  patient  access  to  Repatha  treatment.  In  an  effort  to  reduce barriers  to  access,  we  reduced  the  net  price  of  Repatha  by  providing  greater  discounts  and  rebates  to  payers,  including  PBMs  that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use. For example, in late 2018 and early 2019, in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare, and on December 31,  2019,  we  discontinued  the  higher  list  price  option  for  Repatha.  Despite  these  net  and  list  price  reductions,  some  payers  have restricted,  and  may  continue  to  restrict,  patient  access  and  have  and  may  continue  to  change  formulary  coverage  for  Repatha,  seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, and negatively affect Repatha sales.\n\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements  and  limiting  patient  access  and  usage.  For  example,  in  the  United  States,  as  of  the  beginning  of  2021,  the  top  five integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 85% of all pharmacy prescriptions. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers, and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, CVS, Express Scripts and United Health Group, respectively, each created Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their respective leverage to negotiate deeper discounts. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial  payers  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  product  sales,  business  and  results  of  operations.  Policy  reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or  consequences  for  our  business  and  how  we  interact  with  these  entities.  See Concentration  of  sales  at  certain  of  our  wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\n-Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products\n\nOutside the United States, we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Part I, Item 1.  Business-Reimbursement. IRP has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external  benchmark  of  a  product's  price  in  other  countries.  IRP  policies  can  change  quickly  and  frequently  and  may  not  reflect differences  in  the  burden  of  disease,  indications,  market  structures,  or  affordability  differences  across  countries  or  regions.  Other expenditure control practices, including but not limited to the use of revenue clawbacks, rebates and percentage caps on price increases, are  used  in  various  foreign  jurisdictions  as  well.  In  addition,  countries  may  refuse  to  reimburse  or  may  restrict  the  reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA's approval of Repatha for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for Repatha in France prior to 2020 was limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with HoFH) following a national health technology assessment, which had limited our efforts in France to expand Repatha access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region.

          "chunk_text": "ENBREL's profitability in Medicare. In January 2025, CMS announced the next 15 drugs for Medicare price setting that will be applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, which includes Otezla. Also under the IRA, starting on January 1, 2024, Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning on January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance will become reduced in the catastrophic phase (resulting in a shift and increase of such costs to Part D plans and manufacturers, including by requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs). Further, the IRA created a mechanism for CMS to collect rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation. We began to accrue for rebate obligations on October 1, 2022 for Medicare Part D and on January 1, 2023 for Medicare Part B.\n\nOther potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; increasing transparency in drug pricing; using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices; referencing foreign prices; and changes to government rebate programs. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida to move forward with its importation program proposal, which excludes biologics. CMS also issued a proposed Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rule that would have required manufacturers to aggregate or 'stack' all rebates, discounts or other price concessions made to separate, unrelated entities across the pharmaceutical supply chain on a given unit of product to determine the 'Best Price,' a metric that is used to determine Medicaid rebates and 340B statutory rates. This proposal was not finalized but remains a policy that could be reconsidered in the future. Further, at the state level, eight states (Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish PDABs to identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and in four states (Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington) include authority for the state PDAB to set upper payment limits on certain drugs for in-state patients, payers and providers.\n\nIn  many  countries  other  than  the  United  States,  government-sponsored  healthcare  systems  are  the  primary  payers  for  drugs  and  biologics.  With  increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in rebates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many governments use health technology assessment organizations to judge the added benefit of new treatments over existing ones, metrics which are then used to set reimbursement prices and/or set coverage limits. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that governments will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The EU is currently undergoing a review and revision of its pharmaceutical legislation. Various proposals are under consideration with the EU Council, followed by a negotiation among the EU government to agree to a final law. Full implementation is not expected until 2027 or later. The new legislation, if implemented, will likely have a significant impact on the landscape for access and pricing decisions within EU Member States.\n\nThe dynamics and developments discussed above create pressures on the pricing and potential usage of our products and on the industry. G iven the diverse interests  in  play  between  payers,  biopharmaceutical  manufacturers,  policy  makers,  healthcare  providers  and  independent  organizations,  if  and  whether  the  parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:\n\n- investing billions of dollars annually in R&amp;D;\n- pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;\n- developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;\n- partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;\n- providing patient support and education programs;\n- helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and\n- working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and in which patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.\n\nSee  Item  1A.

Prolia contains the same active ingredient as XGEVA but is approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Prolia was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or in patients who have failed or are intolerant  to  other  available  osteoporosis  therapy.  In  Europe,  Prolia  is  used  primarily  for  the  treatment  of  osteoporosis  in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture.\n\n## Otezla\n\nWe market Otezla, a small molecule that inhibits PDE4, in many countries around the world. Otezla was acquired from BMS in November 2019 after their acquisition of Celgene. Otezla is an oral therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis  across  all  severities  for  whom  phototherapy  or  systemic  therapy  is  appropriate,  patients  with  active  psoriatic  arthritis  and patients with oral ulcers associated with Beh\u00e7et's disease.

Under our collaboration, UCB has rights to lead commercialization for EVENITY in most countries in Europe. Amgen, as the principal, leads commercialization for EVENITY  and recognizes product sales in all other territories, including the United States. G lobal development costs and commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration are shared equally. Amgen manufactures and supplies EVENITY worldwide.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, global profit and loss share expenses were $547 million, $396 million and $255 million, respectively, and were recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net costs recovered from and due to UCB during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were not material.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nIn January 2020, we acquired an equity stake in BeiG ene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. For  additional  information  regarding  our  equity  investment  in  BeiG ene,  see  Note  10,  Investments.  Under  the  collaboration,  BeiG ene  began  selling  XG EV A  in  2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen would pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China of such products for a specified period. Amgen manufactures and supplies the collaboration products to BeiGene.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiG ene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash and development services of up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiG ene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiG ene will share profits and losses equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen also pays royalties to BeiGene.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net costs recovered from BeiG ene for oncology product candidates were $122 million, $109 million and $199 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, product sales from Amgen to BeiG ene under the collaboration were $259 million, $125 million and $64 million, respectively, and were recorded in Product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Profit and loss share expenses related to the initial product-specific commercialization period were not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.\n\nWe are in a collaboration and licensing agreement with Kyowa Kirin to jointly develop and commercialize rocatinlimab, an anti-OX40 fully human monoclonal antibody, worldwide, except in Japan. Rocatinlimab is for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, with potential for treatment of other autoimmune diseases.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we lead the global development, manufacture and commercialization of rocatinlimab, except in Japan. Kyowa Kirin will co-promote rocatinlimab with Amgen in the United States and have opt in rights to co-promote rocatinlimab in various other markets outside the United States, including in Europe and Asia.\n\nWe made an upfront payment of $400 million to Kyowa Kirin that was recognized in R&amp;D expense in the third quarter of 2021. Amgen and Kyowa Kirin share equally the global development costs, except in Japan, and the U.S. commercialization costs. Outside the United States and Japan, any commercialization costs incurred by Kyowa Kirin will be reimbursed by Amgen. We may also be required to make milestone payments of up to $850 million contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory events and commercial thresholds. We will also pay Kyowa Kirin significant double-digit royalties on global sales, except in Japan. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net costs recovered from Kyowa Kirin were $166 million, $93 million and $23 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Other\n\nIn addition to the collaborations discussed above, we have various other collaborations that are not individually significant to our business at this time. Pursuant to the terms of those agreements, we may be required to pay additional amounts, or we may receive additional amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones that in the aggregate could be significant. We may also incur or have reimbursed to us significant R&amp;D costs if a related product candidate were to advance to late-stage clinical trials. In addition, if any products related to these collaborations are approved for sale, we may be required to pay significant royalties, or we may receive significant royalties on future sales. The payments of these amounts, however, are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events that have high degrees of uncertainty of occurrence.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen was involved with Celgene, which produced the drug POMALYST/IMNOVID (evidence from AMGN_10k_2022.pdf). By 2024, Amgen's own product KYPROLIS was shown to directly compete with POMALYST/IMNOVID, which is still marketed by Celgene (evidence from AMGN_10k_2024.pdf). This indicates that Amgen transitioned from a collaborative or affiliated relationship with Celgene to a competitive stance, leveraging its own oncology portfolio to challenge Celgene's product in the market. This evolution suggests a strategic shift in Amgen's approach to the multiple myeloma treatment segment, where it now competes with former partners.",

      "question": "How did the 2023 RADV Audit Rule changes affect Signify Health's financial risk profile ahead of its acquisition by CVS and integration into the Health Services segment?",
      "answer": "The 2023 RADV Audit Rule, which eliminated the FFS Adjuster and continued the use of extrapolation in Medicare Advantage audits, increased Signify Health's financial exposure to CMS audits. Previously, the FFS Adjuster limited repayment obligations by comparing error rates to Original Medicare, but its removal meant Signify Health could face larger extrapolated repayments based on audit findings. This regulatory shift introduced significant uncertainty regarding Medicare Advantage reimbursement, directly impacting Signify Health\u2019s financial planning and risk management. CVS acquired Signify Health in March 2023 for $30.50 per share, or approximately $8 billion in total, and integrated it into the Health Services segment. The acquisition timing coincided with this regulatory risk, potentially increasing the financial burden during integration, especially as CMS audits are expected to focus on high-risk contracts. The lack of clarity around CMS audit methodology and extrapolation practices added complexity to Signify Health\u2019s valuation and long-term strategic alignment within CVS.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVS(2023) \u2192 RADV Audit Rule: The 2023 finalization of the RADV Audit Rule removed the FFS Adjuster, increasing the risk of larger extrapolated repayments for Medicare Advantage plans.",
        "Hop 2: RADV Audit Rule \u2192 Signify Health: The rule negatively impacted Signify Health\u2019s financial risk profile by increasing exposure to CMS audits and repayment obligations.",
        "Hop 3: Signify Health \u2190 CVS(2024): CVS acquired Signify Health in March 2023 for $30.50 per share, integrating it into the Health Services segment, during a period of heightened regulatory uncertainty."

          "chunk_text": "- Data Validation Audits ('RADV Audit Rule') issued in January 2023 or other changes that may result from enforcement or audit actions, could: materially affect the amount of our Medicare reimbursement, require us to raise prices or reduce the benefits we offer to Medicare beneficiaries, impact the services provided by, or the financial performance of, Oak Street Health and Signify Health and potentially limit our (and the industry's) participation in the Medicare program.\n- The RADV Audit Rule creates uncertainty for Medicare Advantage plans. The lack of detail provided with respect to how CMS will select contracts and claims to audit, the methodology CMS will use, and how it will extrapolate as part of the RADV Audit Rule may impact future Medicare Advantage bids and result in other implications. The RADV Audit Rule also permits extrapolation of OIG contract level audits for payment years 2018 forward. The RADV Audit Rule is subject to ongoing litigation and the outcome and future impacts are uncertain.\n- Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures. Further, as a result of the ACA and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules, clients of our PBM business could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this phenomenon occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D products.\n- Our Medicare Part D operating results and our ability to expand our Medicare Part D business could be adversely affected if: the cost and complexity of Medicare Part D exceed management's expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; further changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D (including changes related to the IRA) are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; changes to the applicable regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; the government alters Medicare Part D program requirements or reduces funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; or reinsurance thresholds are reduced.\n- The IRA contains significant changes to the Part D program that began in 2023 and will continue to 2032 that shifts more of the claim liability to plans and away from the government, including a complete redesign of the Part D standard benefit effective in 2025.\n- We have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our Medicaid products due to difficulties with providers and third-party vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions. As states increase their reliance on encounter data, and some states mandate that certain amounts be included or excluded from encounter data, these difficulties could affect the Medicaid premium rates we receive and how Medicaid membership is assigned to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our Medicaid operating results and cash flows and/or our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain Medicaid programs.\n- If we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a CMS audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, civil monetary penalties or other sanctions, including fines and penalties under the False Claims Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D or other government programs, and on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n- The resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations after being suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the number of members eligible for the Company's Medicaid plans, which could impact our operating results and cash flows from the Medicaid business.\n- Certain of our Medicaid contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data. The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our Medicaid programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and, in part, to set premium rates. We have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect accurate, or to correct inaccurate or incomplete, encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding, operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance.\n- CMS has proposed requiring that health plans offering certain dual eligible programs must also offer Medicaid programs, which could further impact the Company's ability to obtain or retain membership in its dual eligible programs. In addition, states are increasingly requiring companies to offer Medicaid within a state and conducting competitive bid processes to qualify to offer dual eligible products.\n\nPrograms funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that percentage to increase.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS utilized reinsurance agreements primarily to reduce required capital and manage risk, as seen in the 2018 sale of Aetna\u2019s standalone Medicare Part D plans where Aetna retained 100% of the insurance risk via reinsurance agreements for the 2019 plan year. Additionally, in January 2022, CVS entered into two four-year reinsurance agreements to reduce capital requirements on its group Commercial Insured business. By 2024, CVS maintained a strategic stake in Aetna, particularly in managing relationships with health plan payors, indicating a continued emphasis on leveraging Aetna\u2019s infrastructure for risk-sharing and customer retention. This evolution shows a shift from purely capital-driven reinsurance strategies to a more integrated risk and relationship management approach through Aetna\u2019s ongoing role in the company\u2019s health plan ecosystem.",

Total deposit assets and liabilities related to reinsurance agreements that do not qualify for reinsurance accounting under GAAP were not material as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## 16. Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe Company has the following significant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2021:\n\n- ASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The banks maintain accounts to fund claims of the Company's ASC customers. The customer is responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day. In these arrangements, the Company guarantees that the banks will not sustain losses if the responsible ASC customer does not properly fund its account. The aggregate maximum exposure under these arrangements is generally limited to $250 million. The Company can limit its exposure to these guarantees by suspending the payment of claims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded the amount paid by the bank.\n- Separate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent funds maintained as a contractual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations underlying the guaranteed benefits in these Separate Accounts were approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' for additional information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and mortality risk and are required to maintain Separate Accounts balances at or above a specified level. The level of required funds is a function of the risk underlying the Separate Account's investment strategy. If contract holders do not maintain the required level of Separate Accounts assets to meet the annuity guarantees, the Company would",

The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company recorded net assets of $165 million, as well as a charge of $656 million to Research and development expenses, or $0.26 per share, in 2024 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition. In A ugust 2024, M erck and Daiichi Sankyo expanded their  ex isting  global  co-dev elopment  and  co-commercialization  agreement  to  include  M K-6070.  M erck  recognized  income  (recorded  within Other  (income) expense, net ) of $170 million, or $0.05 per share, due to the receipt of an upfront cash payment from Daiichi Sankyo and has also satisfied a contingent quid obligation from the original collaboration agreement.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development\n\nIn connection with business combinations, the Company records the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility . A t  December 31, 2024, the balance of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) was $430 million, primarily consisting of M K-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $418 million, which is in Phase 3 clinical development.\n\nThe IPR&amp;D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&amp;D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. The time periods to receive approvals from the FDA  and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty . Significant delays in the approval process, or the Company's failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the Company from realizing revenues from these products. A dditionally , if the IPR&amp;D programs require additional clinical trial data than previously anticipated, or if the programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the Company will not recover the fair value of the IPR&amp;D recorded as an asset as of the acquisition date. If such circumstances were to occur, the Company's future operating results could be adversely affected and the Company may recognize impairment charges, which could be material.\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded IPR&amp;D impairment charges within Research and development expenses of $779 million and $1.6 billion, respectively (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nAdditional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility . The costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the FDA  or other regulatory agencies for approval.\n\n## Capital E xpenditures\n\nCapital expenditures were $3.4 billion in 2024, $3.9 billion in 2023 and $4.4 billion in 2022. Expenditures in the U.S. were $2.4 billion in 2024, $2.5 billion in 2023 and $2.7 billion in 2022. The Company plans to invest approximately $20 billion in capital projects from 2024-2028, more than $11 billion of which relates to investments in the U.S., including expanding manufacturing capacity for oncology, vaccine and animal health products.\n\nDepreciation expense was $2.1 billion in 2024, $1.8 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022, of which $1.4 billion in 2024, $1.2 billion in 2023 and $1.3 billion in 2022, related to locations in the U.S. T otal depreciation expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included accelerated depreciation of $254 million, $140 million and $120 million, respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nMerck's strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, finance acquisitions and external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders.\n\n",

      "question": "How did CVS's 2022 investments in Common Collective Trusts (valued at $266 million and primarily invested in equity securities) translate into the 2023 Separate Accounts Assets valuation, and what does this indicate about the continuity of their pension investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS reported a $266 million investment in Common Collective Trusts, which were described as funds primarily investing in equity securities through underlying funds and valued at net asset value per share/unit. These Common Collective Trusts are explicitly stated to be part of the Separate Accounts Assets, which are maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders in large case pensions products. In 2023, the valuation methodologies and structure of Separate Accounts Assets remained consistent, with investments in common/collective trusts still carried at fair value and classified in Level 2 based on the NAV of the underlying equity-focused funds. The continuity in valuation methods, legal segregation of assets, and alignment with contract holders' objectives indicates that CVS maintained a consistent pension investment strategy from 2022 to 2023, preserving the role of Common Collective Trusts within the broader framework of Separate Accounts Assets.",

See Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' for additional information regarding the valuation of cost method investments.\n\n## Separate Accounts Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\nSeparate Accounts assets relate to the Company's large case pensions products which represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders. Since contract holders bear the investment risk of these assets, a corresponding Separate Accounts liability has been established equal to the assets. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income and capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets accrue directly to such contract holders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company's other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity or cash flows.\n\nSeparate Accounts assets include debt and equity securities. The valuation methodologies used for these assets are similar to the methodologies described above in this Note 4 ''Fair Value.'' Separate Accounts assets also include investments in common/collective trusts that are carried at fair value. Common/collective trusts invest in other investment funds otherwise known as the underlying funds. The Separate Accounts' interests in the common/collective trust funds are based on the fair values of the investments of the underlying funds and therefore are classified in Level 2. The assets in the underlying funds primarily consist of equity securities. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued at their respective net asset value ('NAV') per share/unit on the valuation date.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott's disclosure indicated that shares reacquired after issuance under any benefit of the 2009 Program, including Performance Awards, could not be reused under the 2009 Program itself but could be used under the newer 2017 Program. By 2024, the company clarified that shares subject to expired, canceled, or forfeited benefits under the 2009 Program\u2014again including Performance Awards\u2014could be reused for new awards under the 2017 Program, increasing flexibility. This evolution in policy expands Abbott\u2019s ability to issue future stock-based compensation by reusing shares from unexercised or lapsed Performance Awards, improving long-term equity incentive planning.",

      "question": "How did Amgen's 2022 litigation win against Zydus over apremilast patents influence its 2023 decision to appeal the Sensipar antitrust ruling, particularly in terms of legal strategy continuity and risk exposure related to product exclusivity defense?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen secured a favorable judgment against Zydus regarding apremilast patents, resulting in an injunction that barred Zydus from marketing its generic version until the expiration of the infringed patents ('638, '536, and '283 Patents). This victory reinforced Amgen\u2019s legal strategy of aggressively defending its intellectual property through litigation and appeals, as evidenced by Zydus filing a Notice of Appeal on October 27, 2021, and Amgen countering with its own appeal the next day. By 2023, this pattern of strategic litigation defense carried over into Amgen\u2019s response to the Sensipar antitrust case, where it filed a Notice of Appeal on July 3, 2023, after the Delaware District Court denied its motion to dismiss the reverse payment claim. The continuity in Amgen\u2019s legal posture\u2014leveraging appellate review to protect product exclusivity and market positioning\u2014suggests a consistent corporate strategy to mitigate risk and preserve revenue streams tied to key drugs. The financial stakes were significant in both cases: apremilast (Otezla) generated $1.6B in 2022 revenue, while Sensipar had previously contributed over $1B annually before generic competition. This pattern indicates that Amgen\u2019s 2022 litigation success likely emboldened its willingness to pursue appellate remedies in 2023 to defend market exclusivity and manage legal risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN(2022) \u2192 Zydus: Amgen successfully defended its apremilast patents in court, securing an injunction that protected its market exclusivity.",
        "Hop 2: Zydus \u2192 Notice of Appeal: Zydus filed an appeal of the court\u2019s decision, prompting Amgen to also file an appeal to defend its patent position.",
        "Hop 3: Notice of Appeal \u2190 AMGN(2023): Amgen filed a Notice of Appeal in the Sensipar antitrust case, continuing its strategy of using appellate litigation to protect product exclusivity."

(Roche),  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  New  Jersey  District  Court  against  Samsung  Bioepis  Co.,  Ltd. (Bioepis). This lawsuit stems from Bioepis' submission of an application for FDA licensure of an etanercept product as biosimilar to Amgen's ENBREL. Amgen and Roche have asserted infringement of five patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,063,182, 8,163,522 (the '522 Patent),  7,915,225,  8,119,605  and  8,722,631.  By  their  complaint,  Amgen  and  Roche  seek  an  injunction  to  prohibit  Bioepis  from commercializing its biosimilar etanercept product in the United States prior to the expiry of such patents. On August 5, 2019, Bioepis responded to the complaint, denying infringement and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. On January 9, 2020 and subject to the terms of a confidential stipulation and court order of January 6, 2020, the New Jersey District  Court  entered  a  consent  injunction  that  prohibits  Bioepis  from  making,  using,  offering  to  sell,  selling  or  importing  into  the United  States  Bioepis'  etanercept  product.

      "question": "How did the legal challenges against Comirnaty in 2024 impact Pfizer's collaborative revenue model with BioNTech, particularly in light of the amended EU supply agreement and the evolution of their global commercialization strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech shared global commercialization rights for Comirnaty, with Pfizer recognizing revenues on a gross basis in most markets and recording its share of gross profits from BioNTech's sales in Germany and Turkey. By 2024, the legal challenges from GSK and Promosome alleging patent infringement by Comirnaty introduced potential liabilities and commercial risks that could affect future revenue streams. Despite this, Pfizer and BioNTech continued to rely on each other under an amended EU supply agreement that extended delivery phasing through 2026 with added flexibility for member states, indicating ongoing strategic interdependence. This legal pressure in 2024, while not yet resolved, likely prompted Pfizer to reassess its risk exposure and dependency on BioNTech in markets where the two companies jointly operate.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2023) \u2192 [Comirnaty]: Pfizer co-commercializes Comirnaty with BioNTech, recognizing gross revenues and sharing profits in international markets.",
        "Hop 2: [Comirnaty] \u2192 [BioNTech]: In 2024, Comirnaty faces multiple patent infringement lawsuits, involving both Pfizer and BioNTech, potentially affecting their joint commercialization model.",
        "Hop 3: [BioNTech] \u2190 [PFE](2024): Pfizer continues to depend on BioNTech under a revised EU supply agreement through 2026, highlighting ongoing strategic interdependence despite legal risks."

By 2024, LLY emphasized increased regulatory and development risks, noting that continued approval may depend on confirmatory Phase 3 trials, and that delays or failures in development could impact the CVR's value. This reflects a shift from highlighting Fast Track status as a milestone to acknowledging the uncertainty in achieving full CVR value, aligning with broader risk disclosures around development timelines and financial exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2023) \u2192 PR006: LLY acquired PR006 through the Prevail acquisition, with a CVR contingent on regulatory approval by December 31, 2024.",
        "Hop 2: PR006 \u2192 Fast Track Designation: PR006 received Fast Track designation from the FDA, indicating early regulatory momentum.",
        "Hop 3: Fast Track Designation \u2190 LLY(2024): In 2024, LLY disclosed heightened risks around Fast Track development, including dependency on Phase 3 confirmatory trials and uncertainty in achieving CVR milestones."

      "question": "How did the change in MRK's dependency on Gardasil/Gardasil 9 between 2023 and 2024 reflect shifts in the company's revenue concentration and exposure to market-specific risks, particularly in light of the slowing demand in China?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MRK's revenue was heavily concentrated in its key products, particularly Keytruda and Gardasil/Gardasil 9, which together accounted for 56% of total sales. The company explicitly noted its dependence on these products and the material adverse impact any market disruption could have. By 2024, while Keytruda remained dominant at 46% of total sales, the company highlighted a specific risk related to slowing demand for Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in China, signaling a shift in dependency and an emerging market-specific vulnerability. This evolution shows that while the company maintained its reliance on key products, the composition of that dependency changed, with Gardasil/Gardasil 9 facing new regional headwinds that could threaten revenue stability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Key products generate a significant amount of the Company's profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for its leading products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flows depends largely upon the continued profitability of the Company's key products, such as Keytruda , Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Lynparza, Bravecto , and Bridion . In 2024, the Company's oncology portfolio, led by Keytruda , represented substantially all of the Company's revenue growth. In particular, in the aggregate, in 2024, sales of Keytruda represented 46% of the Company's total sales. A s a result of the Company's dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products, such as the slowing demand for Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in China which the Company has experienced, could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and financial condition. Other events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the Company's product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the sales of any such products.\n\n## The Company's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in other ways; consequently , the Company may not be able to replace sales of successful products that lose patent protection.\n\nIn order to remain competitive, the Company , like other major pharmaceutical companies, must continue to launch new products. Expected declines in sales of products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the Company's future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products that it may develop through collaborations and joint ventures and products that it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. T o accomplish this, the Company commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development, both through its own dedicated resources and through various collaborations with third parties. There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs and vaccines. A s a result, there is a high risk that funds invested by the Company in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. T o bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market may take a decade or more and failure can occur at any point in the process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested.\n\nFor a description of the research and development process, see Item 1. 'Business - Research and Development' above. Each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals. Therefore, the Company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and resources. Some of the risks encountered in the research and development process include the following: preclinical testing of a new compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be disappointing.\n\nThe Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to  develop,  license  or  otherwise  acquire  compounds,  product  candidates  or  products;  or  whether  any  products,  once  launched,  will  be  commercially successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## The Company's success is dependent on the successful development and marketing of new products, which are subject to substantial risks.\n\nProducts that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or fail to succeed for numerous reasons, including the following:\n\n- findings of ineffectiv eness, superior safety or efficacy of competing products, or harmful side effects in clinical or preclinical testing;",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMGN faced heightened regulatory and competitive risks as the European patent protection for Enbrel (etanercept) expired on June 25, 2022, exposing the product to biosimilar competition in that region. This expiration was part of a broader trend of potential reductions in data exclusivity periods globally, as seen in the renegotiation of the USMCA and ongoing FDA deliberations around 'umbrella exclusivity' for biologics. By 2024, AMGN retained significant U.S. patent protections for Enbrel, with key formulations and methods of preparation set to expire as late as October 2037, allowing the company to maintain market exclusivity in its largest market. This contrast in patent timelines\u2014loss in Europe but continued protection in the U.S.\u2014likely shifted AMGN\u2019s strategic focus toward defending its U.S. market share while adapting to increased biosimilar competition in Europe, which may have influenced pricing strategies, R&D investment in next-generation therapies, and lifecycle management efforts for Enbrel.",

          "chunk_text": "products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  a  requirement  for  at  least  10  years  of  data  exclusivity  for  biologic  products.  Also,  the  FDA  is  considering  whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as 'umbrella exclusivity'). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does  not  apply  to  biological  reference  products  or  were  to  make  other  changes  to  the  exclusivity  period,  this  could  expose  us  to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition  through  policies  enabling  easier  generic  and  biosimilar  approval  and  commercialization,  including  efforts  to  lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential  reimbursement  policies  for  biosimilars  and  pass  new  laws  requiring  more  disclosure  in  the  FDA's  Orange  and  Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered  training  to  help  identify  prior  art,  and  seeking  USPTO's  views  on  practices  that  extend  market  exclusivities,  whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the PTAB on drug patents.\n\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents and unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product by an additional six months.\n\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first  state  to  have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against 'pay for delay' settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement  agreements  are  presumptively  anticompetitive.  The  law  may  result  in  prolonged  litigation  and  fewer  settlements.  Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.\n\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three  pharmaceutical  product  wholesaler  distributors:  McKesson  Corporation, AmerisourceBergen  Corporation  and  Cardinal  Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis  facilities  located  in  the  United  States  and  accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  all  EPOGEN sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs  now  oversee  a  substantial  percentage  of  total  covered  lives  in  the  United  States.  See Our  sales  depend  on  coverage  and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely  to  continue  to  affect,  our  profitability. The  three  largest  PBMs  in  the  United  States  are  now  part  of  major  health  insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing  volume.  Further,  if  one  of  our  significant  wholesale  distributors  encounters  financial  or  other  difficulties  and  becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&amp;D.\n\nAmgen invests heavily in R&amp;D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&amp;D projects yield approved and commercially viable products.

This indicates a minor reduction in investments relying on observable market data (Level 1 inputs), suggesting a potential shift in MDT's short-term investment strategy toward more specialized or less liquid assets. The consistency in the use of Level 1 inputs, however, shows MDT still maintains a portion of highly liquid investments.",

      "question": "How did the shift in LLY's competitive challenges from Generic Pharmaceuticals in 2023 to their reliance on Cardinal Health, Inc. for U.S. distribution in 2024 impact their revenue concentration risk across major wholesale distributors?",
      "answer": "In 2023, LLY identified Generic Pharmaceuticals as a major competitive challenge, noting that the loss of market exclusivity often led to significant revenue loss due to generic substitution. By 2024, LLY's distribution strategy in the U.S. became increasingly dependent on Cardinal Health, Inc., one of three major wholesale distributors (alongside McKesson Corporation and Cencora, Inc.) that collectively accounted for a significant portion of LLY's consolidated revenue. The transition from a focus on competitive threats to a reliance on a concentrated set of distributors suggests a shift in risk from product-level competition to systemic revenue concentration risk. This evolution implies that LLY's revenue stability became more sensitive to its relationships with these key distributors, particularly Cardinal Health, Inc., which also supplies generic pharmaceuticals through its joint venture Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, potentially influencing both competitive dynamics and supply chain leverage.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2023) \u2192 Generic Pharmaceuticals: LLY faced competitive pressure from generic pharmaceuticals, which could significantly reduce branded product revenues after market exclusivity expired.",
        "Hop 2: Generic Pharmaceuticals \u2192 Cardinal Health, Inc.: Cardinal Health, Inc. co-owns Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity, linking it to the supply and competitive landscape of generic drugs.",
        "Hop 3: Cardinal Health, Inc. \u2190 LLY(2024): In 2024, LLY relied heavily on Cardinal Health, Inc. (alongside two other distributors) for U.S. product distribution, with each distributor representing a significant portion of LLY's consolidated revenue."

      "question": "How did the change in BMY's royalty structure through Ono's licensing agreement with Merck (for Keytruda) from 2022 to 2023 impact BMY's share of global PD-1 revenue streams?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY (through its relationship with Ono) received a 75% share of Keytruda royalties from Merck, which were set at 6.5% of global sales. In 2023, the Keytruda royalty agreement was modified, reducing Merck's royalty obligation to 2.5% of global sales from January 1, 2024 onward. This change in the royalty rate, combined with BMY's continued 75% allocation through the Ono-Merck agreement, directly reduced BMY's expected future revenue from the PD-1 franchise despite its production involvement with Keytruda. This reflects a strategic shift in the monetization of PD-1 intellectual property and a reduced financial upside for BMY through the Ono-Keytruda chain.",

Ono is entitled to receive royalties of 4% in North America and 15% in all territories excluding the three countries listed above, subject to customary adjustments.\n\n## Nektar\n\nIn  2018,  BMS  and  Nektar  commenced  a  worldwide  license  and  collaboration  for  the  development  and  commercialization  of Bempegaldesleukin  (NKTR-214),  Nektar's  investigational  immuno-stimulatory  therapy  designed  to  selectively  expand  specific cancer-fighting T cells and natural killer cells directly in the tumor micro-environment. In January 2020, the parties amended the collaboration agreement. The Opdivo and NKTR-214 combination therapy is currently in Phase III clinical studies for metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and RCC. A joint development plan agreed by the parties as part of the original agreement, and updated as part of the January 2020 amendment, specifies development in certain indications and tumor types  with  each  party  responsible  for  the  supply  of  their  own  product.  BMS's  share  of  the  development  costs  associated  with therapies comprising a BMS medicine used in combination with NKTR-214 is 67.5%, subject to certain cost caps for Nektar. The January  2020  amendment  retains  the  cost  sharing  percentages  from  the  original  agreement.  The  parties  will  also  jointly commercialize  the  therapies,  subject  to  regulatory  approval.  BMS's  share  of  global  NKTR-214  profits  and  losses  will  be  35% subject to certain annual loss caps for Nektar.\n\nBMS paid Nektar $1.85 billion for the rights discussed above and 8.3 million shares of Nektar common stock which represented a 4.8% ownership interest.  BMS's equity  ownership  is  subject  to  certain  lock-up,  standstill  and  voting  provisions  for  a  five-year period. The amount of the up-front payment allocated to the equity investment was $800 million after considering Nektar's stock price on the date of closing and current limitations on trading the securities. The remaining $1.05 billion of the up-front payment was allocated to the rights discussed above. BMS will also pay up to $1.8 billion upon the achievement of contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones over the life of the alliance period. Research and development cost reimbursements were $98 million in 2021, $132 million in 2020 and $108 million in 2019.\n\n## 2seventy bio (formerly bluebird)\n\nOn November 4, 2021, bluebird completed the tax-free spin-off of its oncology programs and portfolio into 2seventy bio, Inc., an independent, publicly-traded company.\n\nThe  parties  jointly  develop  and  commercialize  novel  disease-altering  gene  therapy  product  candidates  targeting  BCMA.  The collaboration arrangement began in 2013 and included (i) a right for BMS to license any anti-BCMA products resulting from the collaboration,  (ii)  a  right  for  2seventy  bio  to  participate  in  the  development  and  commercialization  of  any  licensed  products resulting  from  the  collaboration  through  a  50/50  co-development  and  profit  share  in  the  U.S.  in  exchange  for  a  reduction  of milestone  payments,  and  (iii)  sales-based  milestones  and  royalties  payable  to  2seventy  bio  upon  the  commercialization  of  any licensed  products  resulting  from  the  collaboration  if  2seventy  bio  declined  to  exercise  their  co-development  and  profit  sharing rights. The options to license idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121) and bb21217 were exercised in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2022, the parties elected to not pursue further development of bb21217.\n\nAll profits and losses relating to developing, commercializing and manufacturing ide-cel within the U.S. are shared equally. BMS is exclusively responsible for the development and commercialization of ide-cel outside the U.S.\n\nIn  2020,  terms  of  the  collaboration  were  amended  including  certain  manufacturing  obligations.  Both  parties  were  also  released from future exclusivity related to BCMA-directed T cell therapies. BMS paid $200 million to extinguish its obligation for future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on ide-cel, which was included in Research and development expense in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the FDA approved ide-cel (' Abecma ' ) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Net product sales of Abecma  within  the  Alliance  territory  were  $158  million  and  related  profit  sharing  costs  were  $42  million  in  2021.  Cost reimbursements were not material.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the increased use of generic drugs positively impacted CVS's adjusted operating income but also led to intensified pharmacy reimbursement pressure from third-party payors seeking to reduce payments for prescriptions. This pressure was a growing concern for CVS, as noted in their 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, CVS responded by deepening its strategic partnerships with over 30 payors, including all top 5 national payors by Medicare Advantage patients, to implement value-based care models. These partnerships leveraged CVS's Canopy technology to integrate payor claims data and pharmacy data, enabling more effective clinical management and cost control. This evolution reflects a strategic pivot from managing generic drug benefits to actively collaborating with payors to manage overall prescription costs in a value-based framework.",

These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020.

The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead entered a collaboration with Merck to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting HIV treatments, with a cost-sharing model where Gilead and Merck bore 60% and 40% of global development and commercialization costs, respectively. Under the agreement, Merck was designated to lead commercialization in the Rest of World for long-acting oral products, while Gilead was to lead in the EU and Rest of World for injectable products. By 2023, this arrangement remained largely unchanged, with the same cost-sharing structure and commercialization leadership roles. However, the agreement included revenue-sharing thresholds\u2014$2.0 billion for oral combinations and $3.5 billion for injectable combinations\u2014where Gilead's revenue share would increase to 65% beyond those thresholds. Despite no revenues being recognized under the agreement in either 2022 or 2023, the continued structure of the partnership and the defined thresholds indicate that Gilead's leadership in the Rest of World market for injectables was strategically reinforced through the evolving dynamics of this collaboration.",

          "chunk_text": "## Merck &amp; Co, Inc. ('Merck')\n\nOn March 13, 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting investigational treatments in HIV that combine Gilead's investigational capsid  inhibitor,  lenacapavir,  and  Merck's  investigational  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  translocation  inhibitor,  islatravir.  The collaboration will initially focus on long-acting oral and injectable formulations.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck will share global development and commercialization costs at 60% and 40%, respectively, across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, if approved, Gilead would lead commercialization in the United States, and Merck would lead commercialization in the European Union ('EU') and rest of the world. For long-acting injectable products, if approved, Merck would lead commercialization in the United States and Gilead would lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world. Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck would jointly promote  the  combination  products  in  the  United  States  and  certain  other  major  markets.  If  successful,  we  would  share  global product revenues with Merck equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-determined per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion in net product sales for the oral combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue would increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Upon passing $3.5 billion in net product sales for the injectable combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue will increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Reimbursements of research and development costs to or from Merck are recorded within Research and development expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  Expenses  recognized  under  the  agreement  were  not  material  for  the  year ended December 31, 2021. No revenues have been recognized under the agreement for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nWe will also have the option to license certain of Merck's investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination with lenacapavir. Reciprocally, Merck will have the option to license certain of Gilead's investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination with islatravir. Each company may exercise its option for such investigational oral integrase inhibitor of the other company within the first five years after execution of the agreement, following completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial of that  integrase  inhibitor.  Upon  exercise  of  an  option,  the  companies  will  split  development  costs  and  revenues,  unless  the  nonexercising company decides to opt-out, in which case the non-exercising company will be paid a royalty.\n\nIn December 2021, Merck announced the decision of the parties to stop all dosing of participants in the Phase 2 clinical study evaluating  an  oral-weekly  combination  treatment  regimen  of  lenacapavir  and  islatravir  following  the  decision  of  FDA  to  place clinical holds on the investigational new drug applications for certain formulations of islatravir.\n\n## Arcus\n\nOn May 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction with Arcus, a publicly traded oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, which included entry into an option, license and collaboration agreement (the 'Collaboration Agreement') and a common stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement (together, and as subsequently amended the 'Stock Purchase Agreements'). In accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreements, which closed on July 13, 2020, we made an upfront payment of $175 million and acquired approximately 6.0 million shares of Arcus common stock for approximately $200  million.  Of  the  total  $391  million  initial  cash  payments,  including  transactional  costs,  made  under  the  agreements,  we recorded $135 million as an equity investment which was calculated based on Arcus' closing stock price on the closing date of the transaction. The remaining $256 million was attributed to (i) the acquired license and option rights of $175 million representing IPR&amp;D assets with no alternative future use, (ii) $65 million of an issuance premium for the equity purchase and (iii) $16 million of direct transactional costs. These amounts were expensed as Acquired in-process research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nUnder the Stock Purchase Agreements, we have the right to purchase additional shares of Arcus from Arcus over the five-year period beginning on the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreements, up to a maximum of 35% of the outstanding voting stock. We are subject to a three-year standstill, restricting our ability to acquire voting stock of Arcus exceeding more than 35% of the thenissued and outstanding voting stock of Arcus, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, we agreed not to dispose of any equity securities of Arcus prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreements without the prior consent of Arcus, subject to certain exceptions. On May 29, 2020, in a separate secondary equity offering, we acquired 2.2 million shares of common stock of Arcus for approximately $61 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we also acquired approximately 5.7 million additional shares of Arcus common stock for $220 million. As a result, we currently own a total of 13.8 million shares of Arcus, which represented approximately 19.5% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of Arcus immediately following the closing of the first quarter 2021 transaction.",

      "answer": "Amgen\u2019s 2017 supply agreement with DaVita, which expired in December 2022, required Amgen to supply at least 90% of DaVita\u2019s ESA requirements for dialysis services in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. This agreement had concentrated approximately 90% of all EPOGEN sales through DaVita. By 2024, despite the agreement's expiration and the looming threat of biosimilar competition, Amgen continued to list EPOGEN among its marketed products, signaling a strategic intent to maintain its market presence. This suggests that Amgen is likely adapting its commercial strategy\u2014possibly through lifecycle management, differentiation, or new market development\u2014to preserve EPOGEN\u2019s value in a more competitive landscape.",

          "chunk_text": "products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  a  requirement  for  at  least  10  years  of  data  exclusivity  for  biologic  products.  Also,  the  FDA  is  considering  whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as 'umbrella exclusivity'). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does  not  apply  to  biological  reference  products  or  were  to  make  other  changes  to  the  exclusivity  period,  this  could  expose  us  to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition  through  policies  enabling  easier  generic  and  biosimilar  approval  and  commercialization,  including  efforts  to  lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential  reimbursement  policies  for  biosimilars  and  pass  new  laws  requiring  more  disclosure  in  the  FDA's  Orange  and  Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered  training  to  help  identify  prior  art,  and  seeking  USPTO's  views  on  practices  that  extend  market  exclusivities,  whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the PTAB on drug patents.\n\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents and unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product by an additional six months.\n\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first  state  to  have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against 'pay for delay' settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement  agreements  are  presumptively  anticompetitive.  The  law  may  result  in  prolonged  litigation  and  fewer  settlements.  Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.\n\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three  pharmaceutical  product  wholesaler  distributors:  McKesson  Corporation, AmerisourceBergen  Corporation  and  Cardinal  Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis  facilities  located  in  the  United  States  and  accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  all  EPOGEN sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs  now  oversee  a  substantial  percentage  of  total  covered  lives  in  the  United  States.  See Our  sales  depend  on  coverage  and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely  to  continue  to  affect,  our  profitability. The  three  largest  PBMs  in  the  United  States  are  now  part  of  major  health  insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing  volume.  Further,  if  one  of  our  significant  wholesale  distributors  encounters  financial  or  other  difficulties  and  becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&amp;D.\n\nAmgen invests heavily in R&amp;D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&amp;D projects yield approved and commercially viable products.

      "question": "How did the redesign of Medicare Part D under the IRA influence CVS's 2024 health care cost forecasting challenges compared to their 2023 revenue recognition practices for Medicare-reimbursed prescriptions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVS recognized revenue for long-term care pharmacy services reimbursed by Medicare Part D, adjusting for variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. By 2024, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) had redesigned Medicare Part D, introducing changes such as beneficiary out-of-pocket cost caps and reduced Federal reinsurance in the catastrophic phase, shifting more costs to Part D plans and manufacturers. These IRA-driven changes under Medicare Part D added complexity to CVS's forecasting of health care costs in 2024, particularly as the company had to account for new financial pressures from capped reimbursements and increased liability for cost-sharing. This regulatory evolution from 2023 to 2024 introduced additional uncertainty into CVS\u2019s ability to accurately predict and manage health care benefit costs, especially under fixed premium models where cost overruns cannot be recovered.",

          "chunk_text": "years such that, by 2031, approximately 100 drugs could be subject to such set prices). The Medicare price setting process for the first 10 drugs subject to Medicare price setting in Part D began in 2023 , which includes ENBREL, our product that currently generates considerable revenues. In 2024, CMS set a price for ENBREL under Medicare Part D that is significantly lower than currently applicable, beginning on January 1, 2026, which we expect will negatively impact its profitability in Medicare. See Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of operations-Product sales-ENBREL. In January 2025, CMS announced the next 15 drugs for Medicare price setting that will be applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, which includes Otezla. Depending on the growth and success of our medicines, other of our medicines may also be subject to selection by CMS in the next, or in a future, cycle of mandatory Medicare price setting. If other of our medicines are selected by CMS for Medicare price setting, we may be required to accept a price set by the government for Medicare similar to the process that was applied to ENBREL. Also under the IRA, Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance  will  be  reduced  in  the  catastrophic  phase  (resulting  in  a  shift  and  increase  of  such  costs  to  Part  D  plans  and  manufacturers,  including  by  requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs). Further, the IRA inflation penalties allows CMS to collect rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation. Such rebate obligations began to accrue October 1, 2022 for Medicare Part D and January 1, 2023 for Medicare Part B, but CMS has not yet issued invoices and has some discretion as to when to issue such invoices to manufacturers. We expect that several of our products will be subject to IRA inflation penalties, and several of our products have been on lists that are issued and updated on a quarterly basis by CMS under a related program under which Medicare beneficiaries are charged reduced coinsurance if price increases exceed inflation. The IRA's Medicare price setting and Medicare redesign are likely to have a material adverse effect on our sales, our business and our results of operations, and such impact is expected to increase through the end of the decade and will depend on factors including the extent of our portfolio's ex posure to Medicare reimbursement, the rate of inflation over time, the number of our products selected for Medicare price setting and the timing of market entry of generic or biosimilar competition. Further, following the enactment of the IRA, the environment remains dynamic and U.S. policymakers continue to demonstrate interest  in  health  care  and  drug  pricing  changes.  For  ex ample,  in April  2024,  CMS  finalized  policy  changes  that  will  give  Part  D  plans  more  flex ibility  to  substitute biosimilars for innovator products on formularies in 2025. Additionally, various government agencies have taken actions designed to reduce expenditures on prescription drugs. For example, HHS released a report with drug pricing proposals that seek to promote competition. The USPTO has also taken steps to strengthen coordination with the FDA to address perceived impediments to generic drug and biosimilar competition. Other CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can also significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed.\n\nWe also face risks related to the reporting of pricing data that affects reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.\n\n-Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, access to, and have affected, and may continue to affect, sales of our products\n\nAt the state level, legislation, government actions, and ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, PDABs, drug importation programs, reference pricing schemes, and other drug pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to report to the state proprietary pricing information or provide advance notice of certain price increases.\n\nStates are also enacting laws referencing the IRA and seeking to regulate and prohibit restrictions on the 340B Program. For example, following the passage of the IRA, bills have been proposed in multiple states that would apply the drug price caps set by HHS for Medicare to drug prices in an individual state, and such references to  IRA  price  caps  have  also  been  included  in  PDAB  legislation.  For  Medicaid  patients,  states  have  established  a  Medicaid  drug  spending  cap  (New  Y ork)  and implemented  a  new  review  and  supplemental  rebate  negotiation  process  (Massachusetts).  Eight  states  (Colorado,  Maine,  New  Hampshire,  New  Jersey,  Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish PDABs to identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and four such states include authority for the state PDABs to set upper payment limits on certain drugs for in-state patients, payers and providers. In 2024, no fewer than 17 states introduced PDAB legislation. The eight states with enacted PDAB laws are in various phases of implementation, with Colorado's PDAB being the furthest along. The Colorado PDAB deemed three of five drugs 'unaffordable,' including ENBREL, and are subject to rulemaking to establish an Upper Payment Limit (UPL) commencing March 2025 and that could be effective as soon as the fourth quarter of 2025. Further, inappropriate ex panded utilization of the 340B Program from broadened application of the 340B discounts has had, and is",

There can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.\n\nPremiums for our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which comprised 94% of our Health Care Benefits segment revenues for 2024, are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fix ed premium period, which is generally twelve months. These forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins, are influenced by historical data (and recent historical data in particular), are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members' behavior and health care utilization patterns and medical claim submission patterns and require a significant degree of judgment. For example, our revenue on Individual Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June of the year before the contract year. Cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we ex pect to incur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. During periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical costs trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic, accurately detecting, forecasting, managing, reserving and pricing for our (and our self-insured customers') medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging. There can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing, and whether our health care and other benefit costs will be affected by pandemics, disease outbreaks and other external events over which we have no control. Even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment's operating results.\n\nWhile the public health emergency related to COVID-19 expired in May 2023, COVID-19 still exists and it may, like many other respiratory viruses, wax and wane depending on geography and seasonality. The future impact COVID-19 will have on the Company and its ability to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs is uncertain, and will depend on geographies impacted, whether new variants emerge and their severity, the availability and costs of testing, vaccination and treatment, and legal and regulatory actions. COVID-19 may also impact provider behavior, utilization trends, membership, and overall economic conditions. These impacts could be adverse and material.\n\nA number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs, including previously uninsured members entering the health care system; Medicare members' utilization of supplemental benefits; other changes in members' behavior, health care utilization patterns and utilization management; turnover in our membership, health care provider and member fraud; additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, including changes to or as a result of the ACA and IRA; changes in the health status of our members; the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics; advances in medical technology; increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies); direct-to-consumer marketing by drug manufacturers; the increasing influence of social media on our members' health care utilization and other behaviors; the shift to a consumer-driven business model; changes in health care practices and general economic conditions (such as inflation and employment levels); increases in labor costs; pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks; influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we expected); clusters of high-cost cases; natural disasters and extreme weather events (which may increase in frequency or intensity as a result of climate change); and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control. For example, the length and severity of the influenza season can have an impact on health care and other benefit costs. In 2022-2023 influenza season had an earlier than average start, including as compared to the 2023-2024 influenza season; the 2020-2021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and the 2019-2020 influenza season maintained a high level of severity for a longer period of time than average. In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this issue.\n\nOur Health Care Benefits segment's operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results.",

      "question": "How did GILD's $406 million expense from reacquiring Trodelvy rights from Everest in 2022 relate to its retained revenue-sharing structure with Janssen for Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey in 2024, particularly regarding the up to 30% of Janssen's revenue share retained by GILD?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GILD incurred a $406 million expense to reacquire Trodelvy rights from Everest, reflecting a strategic shift toward internalizing control over key assets. This contrasts with the 2024 arrangement with Janssen, where GILD retained up to 30% of the revenue share for Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey, maintaining a financial stake while allowing Janssen to handle commercialization. The 2022 Everest exit and 2024 Janssen revenue-sharing structure both demonstrate GILD's selective approach to licensing: exiting external dependencies for high-value oncology assets like Trodelvy while retaining partial upside in HIV partnerships. This evolution shows how GILD adjusted its licensing model to optimize revenue control and strategic flexibility across therapeutic areas.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Inventories\n\nThe fair value step-up adjustment of $881 million, included in inventories of $946 million as of the acquisition date, was primarily determined by the estimated selling price of finished inventory less the cost to complete the manufacturing process and selling effort. The step-up adjustment is recorded in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Income as the inventory is sold to customers and in Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income for inventory used for clinical purposes.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nThe finite-lived intangible asset of $4.6 billion represents the estimated fair value of Trodelvy for metastatic triple-negative breast  cancer  ('TNBC')  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  The  fair  value  was  determined  by  applying  the  income  approach  using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to Trodelvy for metastatic TNBC and a discount rate of 7.0%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value this intangible asset. This intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 12 years.\n\nAcquired  IPR&amp;D  assets  consist  of  Trodelvy  for  hormone  receptor  positive,  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 negative,  metastatic  breast  cancer,  Trodelvy  for  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  Trodelvy  for  urothelial  cancer  ('UC').  The estimated aggregate fair value of $15.8 billion as of the acquisition date was determined by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to these assets and a discount rate of 7.0%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value these intangible assets. Trodelvy for UC was granted accelerated approval by FDA in April 2021 and $1.0 billion was reclassified to finite-lived intangibles from IPR&amp;D. See Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information.\n\nSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset fair values include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including revenue, cost of sales, research and development costs, and sales and marketing expenses); probability of success; the discount rate selected to measure the inherent risk of future cash flows; the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, among other factors.\n\nWe also recorded an intangible asset related to a license and supply agreement with a third party, which was entered into by Immunomedics prior  to  the  acquisition.  Under  the  agreement,  the  third  party  was  granted  an  exclusive  license  to  develop  and commercialize Trodelvy in certain territories in Asia and make certain sales milestones and royalty payments to us. The acquisition date fair value of $175 million was determined by estimating the probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to the outlicense and  a  discount  rate  of  7.0%.  The  discount  rate  represents  the  estimated  rate  that  market  participants  would  use  to  value  this intangible asset. This intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 15 years on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe  inputs  used  for  valuing  these  identifiable  intangibles  are  unobservable  and  considered  Level  3  under  the  fair  value measurement and disclosure guidance.",

We currently own 16.7 million shares or approximately 25.8% of the shares issued and outstanding at the time of last purchase in 2019. We are subject to a 10-year standstill restricting our ability to acquire voting securities of G alapagos ex ceeding more than 29.9% of the then-issued and outstanding voting securities of Galapagos. We have two designees appointed to Galapagos' board of directors as of December 31, 2024.\n\nIn January 2025, we agreed to amend the OLCA commensurate with Galapagos' announcement for a planned separation of G alapagos into two entities: a newly to be formed company (to be named at a later date, herein 'SpinCo') with an initial capital allocation of up to approximately \u20ac2.45 billion (approximately $2.54 billion) and Galapagos. At the time of separation, should it occur, G alapagos' and our rights and responsibilities under the OLCA would transfer to SpinCo, and G alapagos would gain full global development and commercialization rights to its pipeline, subject to payment of single digit royalties to G ilead on net sales of certain products. This separation is expected to occur by mid-2025. With respect to G ilead's ownership stake in G alapagos, upon separation, G ilead will hold approximately 25% of the outstanding shares in both G alapagos and SpinCo and will be subject to a lock-up of G alapagos shares through March 2027 and of SpinCo shares until six months after the separation, subject to certain customary exceptions and early termination provisions. The two G ilead designees appointed to G alapagos' board of directors will step down upon the separation and Gilead will be entitled to nominate two directors to SpinCo's board.\n\n## Janssen\n\n## Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey\n\nIn  2009,  we  entered  into  a  license  and  collaboration  agreement  with  Janssen  to  develop  and  commercialize  a  fix ed-dose  combination  of  our  Truvada  and Janssen's non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, rilpivirine. This combination was approved in the U.S. and EU in 2011, and is sold under the brand name Complera in the U.S. and Eviplera in the EU. The agreement was amended in 2014 to expand the collaboration to include another product containing Janssen's rilpivirine and our emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide ('Odefsey').\n\nUnder the amended agreement, Janssen granted us an exclusive license to Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey worldwide, but retained rights to distribute both combination products in certain countries outside of the U.S. Neither party is restricted from combining its drugs with any other drug products except those which are similar to the components of Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey.\n\nWe are responsible for manufacturing Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey and have the lead role in registration, distribution and commercialization of both products except in the countries where Janssen distributes. Janssen has exercised a right to co-detail the combination product in some of the countries where we are the selling party.\n\nUnder the financial provisions of the 2014 amendment, the selling party sets the price of the combined products and the parties share revenues based on the ratio of the net selling prices of the party's component(s), subject to certain restrictions and adjustments. We retain a specified percentage of Janssen's share of revenues, including up to 30% in major markets. Sales of these products are included in Product sales and Janssen's share of revenues is included in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cost of goods sold relating to Janssen's share was $403 million, $430 million and $483 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including withdrawal of a product from the market, material breach by either party or expiry of the revenue share payment term. We may terminate the agreement without cause with respect to the countries where we sell the products.\n\n## Symtuza\n\nIn 2014, we amended a license and collaboration agreement with Janssen to develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of Janssen's darunavir and our cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide ('G ilead Compounds'). This combination was approved in the U.S. and EU in July 2018 and September 2017, respectively, and is sold under the brand name Symtuza.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2014 amendment, we granted Janssen an exclusive license to Symtuza worldwide. Janssen is responsible for manufacturing, registration, distribution and commercialization of Symtuza worldwide. We are responsible for the intellectual property related to the G ilead Compounds and are the exclusive supplier  of  the  G ilead  Compounds.  Neither  party  is  restricted  from  combining  its  drugs  with  any  other  drug  products  ex cept  those  which  are  similar  to  the components of Symtuza.",

As the license was deemed to be the predominant item to which the revenue share relates, we recognize our share of the Symtuza revenue in the period when the corresponding sales of Symtuza by Janssen occur. We record our share of the Symtuza revenue as Product sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily because we supply the Gilead Compounds to Janssen for Symtuza.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including withdrawal of a product from the market, material breach by either party or expiry of the revenue share payment term. Janssen may terminate the agreement without cause on a country-by-country basis, in which case Gilead has the right to become the selling party for such country(ies) if the product has launched but has been on the market for fewer than 10 years. Janssen may also terminate the entire agreement without cause.\n\n## Japan Tobacco\n\nIn 2005, Japan Tobacco, Inc. ('Japan Tobacco') granted us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir, a novel HIV  integrase inhibitor, in all countries of the world, excluding Japan, where Japan Tobacco retained such rights. Effective December 2018, we entered into an agreement with Japan Tobacco to acquire the rights to market and distribute certain products in our HIV  portfolio in Japan and to ex pand our rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir to include Japan. We are responsible for the marketing of the products as of January 1, 2019.\n\nWe are responsible for seeking regulatory approval in our territories and are required to use diligent efforts to commercialize elvitegravir for the treatment of HIV infection. We bear all costs and expenses associated with such commercialization efforts and pay a royalty to Japan Tobacco based on our product sales. Our sales of these products are included in Product sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Royalties due to Japan Tobacco are included in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Royalty expenses recognized were $139 million, $167 million and $198 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2018 agreement, we paid Japan Tobacco $559 million in cash and recognized an intangible asset of $550 million reflecting the estimated fair value of the marketing-related rights acquired from Japan Tobacco. The intangible asset is being amortized over nine years, representing the period over which the majority of the benefits are ex pected to be derived from the applicable products in our HIV  portfolio. The amortization ex pense is classified as selling ex pense and recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including material breach by either party or expiry of royalty payment term. We may also terminate the entire agreement without cause.\n\n## Everest\n\nIn April 2019, Everest Medicines ('Everest') and Immunomedics entered into an agreement granting Everest an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Trodelvy in  G reater  China,  South  Korea,  Singapore,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  V ietnam,  Thailand,  Malaysia  and  Mongolia  (the  'Territories').  G ilead  subsequently acquired Immunomedics in October 2020 and assumed the Everest license and supply agreement, which provided for certain sales milestones and royalties payments to  be  made to  G ilead  and  was  recorded  as  a  $175  million  finite-lived  asset  as  part  of  the  purchase  accounting.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022,  we  reacquired  all development and commercialization rights for Trodelvy from Everest and terminated the previous agreement. Under the terms of the new agreement, G ilead made $280 million in upfront termination payments to Everest, of which $84 million was made in 2022 and $196 million was made in 2023. In addition, Everest is eligible to receive up to $175 million in potential additional payments upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. We accounted for the new agreement as a contract termination, which includes the reacquisition of commercial rights and the settlement of our pre-existing relationship with Everest. As a result, we recorded an expense of $406 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022, which primarily represents the upfront costs and write-off of the remaining value of the pre-existing asset related to the prior agreement. Simultaneously, we recorded an acquired finite-lived asset with a fair value of $50 million for the commercial rights reacquired for products approved in the Territories.",

The Company and plaintiffs each appealed the class certification decision. The Court of A ppeal of Quebec amended the class period to start July 2, 2014, allowed the second plaintiff to serve as a class representative, and modified the list of conditions in the class definition. The Company sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which was denied. The case is proceeding in the Superior Court.\n\n## 340B Program Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, M erck filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge the letter M erck received from the U.S. Health Resources and Services A dministration (HRSA ) in M ay 2022 regarding M erck's 340B Program integrity initiative. On September 17, 2024, the court entered a consent judgment granting M erck the relief it had sought in the litigation, including declarations that HRSA 's M ay 2022 letter was unlawful and that the version of Merck's 340B Program integrity initiative at issue in the litigation did not violate Section 340B on its face.\n\n## Qui Tam Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania unsealed a complaint that had been filed against the Company under the federal False Claims A ct by two former employees alleging, among other things, that the Company defrauded the U.S. government by falsify ing data in connection with a clinical study conducted on the mumps component of the Company's M-M-R II v accine. The complaint alleges the fraud took place between 1999 and 2001. The U.S. government had the right to participate in and take over the prosecution of this lawsuit but notified the court that it declined to exercise that right. The two former employees pursued the lawsuit without the involvement of the U.S. government. In July 2023, the court denied relators'  motion  for  summary  judgment,  granted two of the  Company's motions for summary judgment, and denied the Company's remaining motions for summary judgment as moot. The court entered judgment in favor of the Company and dismissed relators' amended complaint in full with prejudice. Relators appealed that decision, and in A ugust 2024, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's decision.\n\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, two putative class action lawsuits on behalf of direct purchasers of the M -M -R II v accine, which charge that the Company misrepresented the efficacy of the M-M-R II v accine in v iolation of federal antitrust laws and v arious state consumer protection laws, are pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' state law claims and denied the motion as to plaintiffs' antitrust claim. The Company appealed, and on October 7, 2024, the Third Circuit reversed-in-part the district court's order and remanded the case with instructions to enter summary judgment for the Company . On November 20, 2024, plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, and on February 10, 2025, the court denied the petition.\n\n## Merck KGaA Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, in January 2016, to protect its long-established brand rights in the U.S., the Company filed a lawsuit against M erck KGaA , Darmstadt, Germany (KGaA), historically operating as the EM D Group in the U.S., alleging it improperly uses the name 'M erck' in the U.S. KGaA  has filed suit against the Company in a number of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. alleging, among other things, unfair competition, trademark infringement and/or corporate name infringement. In certain of those jurisdictions, KGaA  also alleges breach of the parties' coexistence agreement. The litigation is ongoing in the U.S. with no trial date set, and also ongoing in jurisdictions outside of the U.S.\n\n## Patent Litigation\n\nFrom time to time, generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products file abbreviated New Drug A pplications (A NDA s) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) seeking to market generic forms of the Company's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned by the Company . T o protect its patent rights, the Company may file patent infringement lawsuits against such generic companies. Similar lawsuits defending the Company's patent rights may exist in other countries. The Company intends to vigorously defend its patents, which it believes are valid, against infringement by companies attempting to market products prior to the expiration of such patents. A s with any litigation, there can be no assurance of the outcomes, which, if adverse, could result in significantly  shortened  periods  of  exclusivity  for  these  products  and,  with  respect  to  products  acquired  through  acquisitions  accounted  for  as  business combinations, potentially significant intangible asset impairment charges.\n\nBridion -As previously disclosed, between January and November 2020, the Company received multiple Paragraph IV  Certification Letters under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying the Company that generic drug companies had filed applications to the FDA  seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of Bridion (sugammadex)",

      "question": "How did the impact of biosimilar competition on Humira's revenue in 2023 influence AbbVie's strategic focus on biologics manufacturing risks and pipeline collaborations in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Humira faced direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity in January 2023, leading to a 35% decline in U.S. sales and a 32% overall drop in global revenue. This significant revenue erosion prompted AbbVie to reassess its strategic positioning in the biologics market. By 2024, the company emphasized the risks associated with biologics manufacturing and the importance of maintaining a robust pipeline, particularly through collaborations. The 2024 filings highlighted AbbVie's increased focus on managing the complexities of biologics production, including supply chain vulnerabilities and facility expansion challenges, while also underscoring the need for strong third-party alliances to bolster its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. This evolution reflects a strategic pivot to mitigate future revenue losses by strengthening internal capabilities and external partnerships in response to the competitive pressures seen in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: ABBV(2023) \u2192 Biosimilar Competition: Humira's U.S. sales dropped 35% due to biosimilar competition after losing exclusivity in January 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Biosimilar Competition \u2192 Humira: Humira, a key biologic product, directly faced biosimilar erosion globally, prompting AbbVie to implement strategies to manage formulary access and revenue loss.",
        "Hop 3: Humira \u2190 ABBV(2024): In 2024, AbbVie emphasized the broader risks of biologics manufacturing and pipeline collaboration dependencies, reflecting a strategic response to the 2023 revenue declines."

          "chunk_text": "## A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products.\n\nAbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. Such disputes could result in AbbVie's loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of AbbVie's commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.\n\n## Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\nThe successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and current governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. As a result, manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics-including Humira, Skyrizi, Botox and Creon -could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\n## New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.\n\nAbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that research, develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie's products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. In addition, as AbbVie products lose exclusivity, competition surrounding such products will increase and generic and biosimilar products will increasingly penetrate the markets. Furthermore, consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, have lower prices or better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, or have superior performance features than AbbVie's products, and this may negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n\n## The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process requiring critical environmental controls, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer.\n\nThe manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, labor shortages, supply chain disruption, pandemics, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, such batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, ti me and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\n\n17\n\n",

      "question": "How did the shift in LLY's reliance on orphan drug exclusivity for biologics between 2022 and 2023 reflect changes in their strategy to protect revenue amid biosimilar competition?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LLY emphasized the growing competitive threat from biosimilars, noting that biologics like Basaglar faced potential substitution at U.S. pharmacies due to the FDA\u2019s evolving interpretation of biosimilar regulations, as seen with Semglee receiving interchangeable status. This posed a risk of rapid revenue erosion similar to generic drug competition. By 2023, LLY highlighted orphan drug exclusivity as a key mechanism to extend market protection, noting that a specific use of a drug or biologic could receive seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. if it met orphan designation criteria. This suggests a strategic pivot toward leveraging orphan designations to maintain exclusivity and protect revenue on select biologics in response to increased biosimilar pressure. The shift reflects a broader use of regulatory exclusivity tools to offset the 12-year baseline exclusivity under the BPCIA, which may be insufficient in markets with faster biosimilar uptake.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2022) \u2192 Biologics: LLY produces biologics and faces increasing biosimilar competition, particularly noting Semglee's interchangeable status and the potential for pharmacy-level substitution.",
        "Hop 2: Biologics \u2192 Orphan Drug Exclusivity: Biologics are subject to orphan drug exclusivity provisions under U.S. law, which grants seven years of market exclusivity for treatments of rare diseases, independent of patent status.",
        "Hop 3: Orphan Drug Exclusivity \u2190 LLY(2023): In 2023, LLY explicitly referenced orphan drug exclusivity as a strategic tool to extend market protection for biologics, noting that orphan designation could provide parallel exclusivity alongside patents."

          "chunk_text": "## Generic Pharmaceuticals\n\nOne of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals. In the U.S. and Europe, the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product, which can cause us to lose a significant portion of the product's revenue in a very short period of time.\n\nFurther, public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In many countries outside the U.S., intellectual property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch.\n\n## Biosimilars\n\nA number of our products and potential new medicines in our clinical-stage pipeline are biologics. In the U.S., the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. Competition for Lilly's biologics may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that, due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. Approval by the FDA ultimately depends on many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.\n\nGlobally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator-developed biologics, including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA and in Europe. The patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market. However, in the U.S., the product exclusivity period under the BPCIA could be affected by recent government proposals and litigation. See \"- Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights.\" In addition, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet entirely clear, and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing. In the U.S., currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" by the FDA will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The FDA has begun to issue \"interchangeable\" designations for biosimilar products.\n\nBiosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. For example, a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro that competes with our product Humalog. On the other hand, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we developed Basaglar, an insulin glargine product, which has the same amino acid sequence as a product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a follow-on biologic in the U.S., and as a biosimilar in Europe and Japan. However, in March 2020, the FDA began regulating all of our insulin products as \"biologics\" rather than \"drugs.\" Based on FDA draft guidance, this change may lessen the amount of data required for competitor biosimilar products to enter the market, some of which could be designated as interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin products at U.S. pharmacies. For example, in June 2020, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for Semglee, a follow-on insulin glargine product that competes with Basaglar in the U.S., and, in July 2021, Semglee received additional FDA approval as a biosimilar that is interchangeable to its reference insulin glargine product. The FDA's interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve and, therefore, the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty.",

          "chunk_text": "individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA's reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.\n\nBiologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products.\n\nAbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications.\n\nThese patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2022 to the early 2040s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie's business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the company's business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the licenses in the United States will begin in 2023 and the licenses in Europe began in 2018.\n\nIn addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica) and those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027, however no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033.\n\nAbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie's trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie's employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the value of Performance Units was $121 million, while in 2024, the Amended 2009 Plan indicated that 1,516,669 shares were subject to outstanding performance units, including dividend equivalents of 91,901 shares. This reflects a continuation of AMGN's use of performance-based equity compensation tied to multi-year performance goals, with the potential for up to 200% of target shares to be awarded based on performance. The plan also maintained a fungible share-counting formula where each performance unit counts as 1.9 shares. The consistency in the use of performance units suggests a stable long-term incentive strategy, despite the decrease in reported value from 2023 to 2024, which may be influenced by timing of grants and performance cycles.",

In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each RSU, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share-counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance  units  granted  represent  target  performance,  and  the  max imum  number  of  units  that  could  be  earned  based  on  our  performance  is  200%  of  the performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024. (1)\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes (i) 5,909,018 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $225.84; (ii) 3,289,089 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs, including 198,925 related dividend equivalents; and (iii) 1,516,669 shares subject to outstanding 2022, 2023 and 2024 performance units, including 91,901 related dividend equivalents. The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2024, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares  that  could  be  issuable  in  the  event  that  above  target  performance  on  the  performance  goals  under  these  outstanding  performance  units  is  achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\nThis plan has terminated as to future grants.

      "answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson transferred $800 million to a group annuity contract issued by a third-party insurer for the U.S. Salaried Pension Plan, indicating a significant de-risking move. By 2024, this amount was halved to $400 million, suggesting a moderation in that strategy. This change implies that JNJ may have reassessed its pension liability funding approach, possibly due to improved plan funding ratios, changes in discount rates affecting liability valuations, or a strategic pivot toward retaining more pension risk in-house. The actuarial gains/losses in both years were primarily driven by discount rate changes, which could have influenced the company's liability positioning and corresponding insurer contract funding decisions.",

(1)\n\n## Note 3: Acquisitions and Divestiture\n\nIn January 2021, February 2020 and 2019, we completed the acquisitions of Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail), Dermira, Inc. (Dermira) and Loxo Oncology, Inc. (Loxo), respectively. These transactions, as further discussed in this note below in Acquisitions of Businesses, were accounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has been recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\n\nWe also acquired assets in development in 2021, 2020, and 2019, which are further discussed in this note below in Asset Acquisitions. Upon each acquisition, the cost allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D was immediately expensed because the compound acquired had no alternative future use. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recorded acquired IPR&amp;D charges of $874.9 million, $660.4 million, and $239.6 million, respectively.\n\n## Acquisitions of Businesses\n\n## Prevail Acquisition\n\n## Overview of Transaction\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. To achieve the full value of the CVR, such regulatory approval must occur by December 31, 2024. If such regulatory approval occurs after December 31, 2024, the value of the CVR will be reduced by approximately 8.3 cents per month until December 1, 2028, at which point the CVR will expire without payment.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition establishes a new modality for drug discovery and development, extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets. The lead gene therapies in clinical development that we acquired were PR001 for patients with Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations and neuronopathic Gaucher disease and PR006 for patients with frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations. Both PR001 and PR006 were granted Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

By 2023, the fair value of mortgage-backed securities increased to $157.3 million.

          "chunk_text": "Our global benefit plans may enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to implement the local investment policy or manage particular portfolio risks. Derivatives are principally used to increase or decrease exposure to a particular public equity, fixed income, commodity, or currency market more rapidly or less expensively than could be accomplished through the use of the cash markets. The plans utilize both exchange-traded and over-the-counter instruments. The maximum exposure to either a market or counterparty credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the receivable, and is managed within contractual limits. We expect all of our counterparties to meet their obligations. The gross values of these derivative receivables and payables are not material to the global asset portfolio, and their values are reflected within the tables below.\n\nThe defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan allocation for the U.S. and Puerto Rico currently comprises approximately 75 percent growth investments and 25 percent fixed-income investments. The growth investment allocation encompasses U.S. and international public equity securities, hedge funds, private equity-like investments, and real estate. These portfolio allocations are intended to reduce overall risk by providing diversification, while seeking moderate to high returns over the long term.\n\nPublic equity securities are well diversified and invested in U.S. and international small-to-large companies across various asset managers and styles. The remaining portion of the growth portfolio is invested in private alternative investments.\n\nFixed-income investments primarily consist of fixed-income securities in U.S. treasuries and agencies, emerging market debt obligations, corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed obligations, and any related repurchase agreements.\n\nHedge funds are privately owned institutional investment funds that generally have moderate liquidity. Hedge funds seek specified levels of absolute return regardless of overall market conditions, and generally have low correlations to public equity and debt markets. Hedge funds often invest substantially in financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives, etc.) using a very broad range of trading activities to manage portfolio risks. Hedge fund strategies focus primarily on security selection and seek to be neutral with respect to market moves. Common groupings of hedge fund strategies include relative value, tactical, and event driven. Relative value strategies include arbitrage, when the same asset can simultaneously be bought and sold at different prices, achieving an immediate profit. Tactical strategies often take long and short positions to reduce or eliminate overall market risks while seeking a particular investment opportunity. Event strategy opportunities can evolve from specific company announcements such as mergers and acquisitions, and typically have little correlation to overall market directional movements. Our hedge fund investments are made through limited partnership interests in fund-of-funds structures and directly into hedge funds. Plan holdings in hedge funds are valued based on net asset values (NAVs) calculated by each fund or general partner, as applicable, and we have the ability to redeem these investments at NAV.\n\nPrivate equity-like investment funds typically have low liquidity and are made through long-term partnerships or joint ventures that invest in pools of capital invested in primarily non-publicly traded entities. Underlying investments include venture capital (early stage investing), buyout, special situations, private debt, and private real estate investments. Private equity management firms typically acquire and then reorganize private companies to create increased long term value. Private equity-like funds usually have a limited life of approximately 10-15 years, and require a minimum investment commitment from their limited partners. Our private equity-like investments are made both directly into funds and through fund-of-funds structures to ensure broad diversification of management styles and assets across the portfolio. Plan holdings in private equity-like investments are valued using the value reported by the partnership, adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through our reporting date. Values provided by the partnerships are primarily based on analysis of and judgments about the underlying investments. Inputs to these valuations include underlying NAVs, discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations, and may also include adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks as applicable. The vast majority of these private partnerships provide us with annual audited financial statements including their compliance with fair valuation procedures consistent with applicable accounting standards.\n\nReal estate is composed of public holdings. Real estate investments in registered investment companies that trade on an exchange are classified as Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy. Real estate investments in funds measured at fair value on the basis of NAV provided by the fund manager are classified as such. These NAVs are developed with inputs including discounted cash flow, independent appraisal, and market comparable analyses.\n\nOther assets include cash and cash equivalents and mark-to-market value of derivatives.",

      "question": "How did BMY's partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals in 2023 regarding milvexian's Fast Track Designation relate to BMY's exposure to IRA-related pricing pressures in 2024, particularly in light of Janssen's legal challenge against the IRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BMY partnered with Janssen Pharmaceuticals to advance milvexian, an investigational oral factor XIa inhibitor, which received Fast Track Designation from the FDA across three indications under the Phase III Librexia program. This partnership positioned BMY to benefit from Janssen's development capabilities and regulatory momentum. However, in 2024, Janssen actively challenged the IRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program in court, arguing that it violated constitutional rights, which introduced regulatory uncertainty. As BMY became subject to the IRA in 2024, this legal challenge by Janssen created a complex environment where BMY faced potential pricing pressures under the IRA while relying on a partner actively opposing the regulation. This dual exposure highlights a strategic tension in BMY's 2024 positioning relative to its 2023 collaboration.",

          "chunk_text": "The IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of inflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for M edicare Part B drugs. Separate IRA  provisions redesign the M edicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater portion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA  provisions may subject manufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties.\n\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and M edicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the IRA 's M edicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen's rights under the First A mendment and the Fifth A mendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA 's mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and while CM S has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs, implementation of the program is still in progress. In A pril 2024, Janssen appealed the district court's denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\n\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies, and other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to increase pricing transparency and controls.\n\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and M edicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. The IRA  and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products.\n\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied on companies for data breaches, violations of priv acy  requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant settlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use and disclosure of personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.\n\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.",

      "question": "How did MRK's pension plan asset valuation approach shift from 2022 to 2023, and what does this reveal about their strategy in measuring fair value for Level 1 assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MRK's U.S. Pension Plans included $236 million in developed markets equities categorized under Level 1 and $3,799 million measured by NAV for developed markets equities. By 2023, the company increased its Level 1 assets to $2,915 million in developed markets equities, while NAV-based assets dropped to $3,156 million. This shift indicates a strategic move toward more actively traded, transparently valued Level 1 assets, as Level 1 assets are prioritized in the fair value hierarchy due to their reliance on quoted market prices. The change aligns with a broader effort to reduce complexity and reliance on NAV-based valuations, which require practical expedients and are not part of the formal fair value hierarchy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK(2022) \u2192 NAV: In 2022, MRK disclosed that $3,799 million of developed markets equities in U.S. Pension Plans were valued using NAV.",
        "Hop 2: NAV \u2192 Level 1 Assets: NAV is used as a practical expedient for certain investments and is excluded from the fair value hierarchy, while Level 1 assets are valued using quoted prices in active markets.",
        "Hop 3: Level 1 Assets \u2190 MRK(2023): In 2023, MRK reported a significant increase in Level 1 assets, with $2,915 million in developed markets equities, indicating a shift away from NAV-based valuations."

      "question": "How did the decline in Aranesp sales in 2023, influenced by a shift toward EPOGEN, compare with Amgen's production and commercialization strategy for EPOGEN in the same year?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen marketed Aranesp, a treatment for anemia caused by chronic kidney disease and chemotherapy, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. By 2023, Aranesp sales declined globally due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and lower net selling prices, with U.S. sales dropping further as independent and medium-sized dialysis organizations transitioned patients to EPOGEN. This shift toward EPOGEN, which Amgen also produces, suggests a strategic realignment in the anemia treatment market. In 2023, EPOGEN was listed among Amgen\u2019s marketed products, indicating continued investment in erythropoiesis-stimulating agents despite the competitive pressure from biosimilars and pricing challenges. The decline in Aranesp sales appears to be partially offset by increased reliance on EPOGEN, which may reflect a broader portfolio optimization strategy following the Horizon acquisition and a push to consolidate market share in the erythropoietin space.",

          "chunk_text": "## ENBREL\n\nWe market ENBREL, a tumor necrosis factor blocker, in the United States and Canada. ENBREL was launched in 1998 and is used primarily in indications for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and patients with active psoriatic arthritis.\n\n## Prolia\n\nWe market Prolia in many countries around the world. Prolia contains the same active ingredient as XGEVA but is approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Prolia was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or in patients who have failed or are intolerant  to  other  available  osteoporosis  therapy.  In  Europe,  Prolia  is  used  primarily  for  the  treatment  of  osteoporosis  in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture.\n\n## Otezla\n\nWe market Otezla, a small molecule that inhibits PDE4, in many countries around the world. Otezla was acquired from BMS in November 2019 after their acquisition of Celgene. Otezla is an oral therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis  across  all  severities  for  whom  phototherapy  or  systemic  therapy  is  appropriate,  patients  with  active  psoriatic  arthritis  and patients with oral ulcers associated with Beh\u00e7et's disease. In Europe, Otezla is approved for second-line use in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis and for patients with oral ulcers associated with Beh\u00e7et's disease who are candidates for systemic therapy.\n\n## XGEVA\n\nWe market XGEVA in many countries around the world. XGEVA was launched in 2010 and is used primarily in the indication for prevention  of  SREs  (pathological  fracture,  radiation  to  bone,  spinal  cord  compression  or  surgery  to  bone)  in  patients  with  bone metastases from solid tumors and multiple myeloma.\n\n## Neulasta\n\nWe market Neulasta, a pegylated protein based on the filgrastim molecule, primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta was launched in 2002 and is used primarily in the indication to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell count in patients with certain types of cancer (nonmyeloid) who receive anticancer medicines (chemotherapy) that can cause fever and a low blood cell count. In 2015, the Neulasta Onpro kit became available in the United States. The Neulasta Onpro kit provides physicians the opportunity to initiate administration of Neulasta on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery of the recommended dose of Neulasta at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving the patient a trip back to the doctor.\n\n## Aranesp\n\nWe market Aranesp primarily in the United States and Europe. It was launched in 2001 and is indicated to treat a lower-thannormal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by CKD in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. Aranesp is also indicated  for  the  treatment  of  anemia  due  to  concomitant  myelosuppressive  chemotherapy  in  certain  patients  with  nonmyeloid malignancies and when chemotherapy will be used for at least two months after starting Aranesp.\n\n## Repatha\n\nWe market Repatha, a PCSK9 inhibitor, in many countries around the world. Repatha was launched in 2015 and is indicated to reduce the risks of myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary revascularization in adults with established CV disease.

(1)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nDuring 2021, Merck delivered on its strategic priorities by executing commercially to drive strong revenue and earnings growth  in  the  year,  completing  key  business  development  transactions,  accelerating  its  broad  pipeline,  and  achieving  notable regulatory milestones. Also, on June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of Organon. The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off.\n\nWorldwide sales were $48.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 17% compared with 2020, or 16% excluding the favorable effect of foreign exchange. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care and animal health. Additionally,  revenue  in  2021  reflects  the  benefit  of  sales  of  molnupiravir,  an  investigational  oral  antiviral  COVID-19 treatment. As discussed below, COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected sales in 2021, but to a lesser extent than in 2020, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.\n\nMerck continues to execute scientifically  compelling  business  development  opportunities  to  augment  its  pipeline.  In November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company evaluating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins through the development of pulmonary and hematologic therapies. In April  2021,  Merck  acquired  Pandion Therapeutics,  Inc.  (Pandion),  a  clinical-stage  biotechnology  company  developing  novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, Merck entered into a collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV.\n\nIn  2021,  Merck  received  over  30  approvals  and  filed  over  20  New  Drug  Applications  (NDAs)  and  supplemental Biologics License Applications (BLAs) across the U.S., the EU, Japan and China. During 2021, the Company received numerous regulatory approvals within oncology. Keytruda received approval for additional indications in the U.S. and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of breast, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, esophageal, melanoma and renal cell cancers, as  well  as  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  the  therapeutic  areas  of  breast,  cervical,  gastric  or  gastroesophageal  junction cancers. Keytruda was also approved in combination with Lenvima both for the treatment of certain adult patients with endometrial cancer  and  for  the  treatment  of  renal  cell  cancer.  Lenvima  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  Eisai  Co.,  Ltd.  (Eisai). Lynparza,  which  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  AstraZeneca  PLC  (AstraZeneca),  received  approval  in  China  as monotherapy for the treatment of certain adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Welireg (belzutifan), an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)",

The sales increase was primarily due to growth in oncology , cardiovascular and animal health, partially offset by declines in diabetes, virology (driven largely by lower sales of COVID-19 medication Lagevrio ), immunology (as M erck's marketing rights to these products ended in 2024) and vaccines.\n\nMerck continues to execute value creating business development opportunities focused on innovation to augment its robust internal pipeline with compelling external science. Highlights of 2024 activity include the following:\n\n- Closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize M K-2010 (LM -299), a novel investigational programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/vascular endothelial growth factor (V EGF) bispecific antibody from LaNova M edicines Ltd (LaNova).\n- Closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize  M K-4082 (HS-10535), an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist from Hansoh Pharma (Hansoh).\n- Acquired global rights to M K-1045 (formerly CN201), a novel investigational clinical-stage bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell associated diseases from Curon Pharmaceutical (Curon).\n- Acquired Eyebiotech Limited (EyeBio), a privately held ophthalmology-focused biotechnology company developing candidates for the prevention and treatment of vision loss.\n\n\u2022\n\nAcquired Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (Harpoon), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body's immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases.\n\nDuring 2024, M erck continued its efforts to address unmet medical needs by launching new products with significant patient benefit, including the U.S. launches of Winrevair , for the treatment of certain adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA H), and Capvaxive, for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Winrevair was also approved in the EU.\n\nThe Company received more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets in 2024, including the Winrevair and Capvaxive approvals noted above, along  with  numerous  approvals  in  oncology . Keytruda receiv ed  approval  for  additional  indications  in  the  U.S.  and/or  internationally   as  monotherapy   in  the therapeutic areas of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma and urothelial carcinoma, in combination with chemotherapy in the therapeutic areas of biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial carcinoma, gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in combination with Padcev (enfortunab vedotin-ejfv) for advanced urothelial carcinoma. A lso in 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain von Hippel-Lindau (V HL) disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery . Lynparza, which is being developed in collaboration with A straZeneca PLC (A straZeneca), received approval in China for the treatment of certain adult patients with germline BRCA -mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high-risk early breast cancer.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory approvals discussed above, the Company advanced its late-stage pipeline with several regulatory submissions.\n\n- MK-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, is a potential first-in-class HER3 directed DX d antibody drug conjugate (A DC), under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. In June 2024, the FDA  issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the Biologics License A pplication (BLA ) due to findings pertaining to an inspection of a third-party manufacturing facility . The CRL did not identify any issues with the efficacy or safety data submitted. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DX d) was discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and is",

In addition, we acquire product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&amp;D  capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product  base.  These arrangements  generally provide for nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees,  development  and  commercial-performance  milestone  payments,  cost  sharing,  royalty  payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\n\nTrade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we  generally  require  counterparties  to  execute  confidentiality  agreements  upon  commencement  of  a  business  relationship  with  us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in early 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash  and  development  services  of  up  to  $1.25  billion.  Upon  regulatory  approval,  BeiGene  will  assume  commercialization  rights  in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.\n\n## Novartis\n\nWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig. On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Part IVNote 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arrangement through December 31, 2021\n\nIn the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal,  recognized  product  sales  of  Aimovig  in  the  United  States,  shared  U.S.  commercialization  costs  with  Novartis  and  paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis held global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&amp;D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to  make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States.\n\n## Arrangement after January 1, 2022\n\nPursuant  to  the  amendment  effective  January  1,  2022,  Novartis  retains  the  ex-U.S.  Novartis  Rights  and  will  continue  to  pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig.

      "answer": "In 2022, MDT had no commercial paper outstanding under the 2015 CP Program, indicating a conservative short-term financing approach. By 2024, MDT had $1.1 billion in commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.45%, showing a strategic shift toward utilizing short-term debt. This increase in issuance was supported by Medtronic Luxco's central role in managing the CP programs and the extension of the Credit Facility maturity to 2028, which provided flexibility. The rise in interest rate from 4.34% in 2023 to 5.45% in 2024 reflects a tighter credit environment, yet MDT still opted to increase short-term borrowing, suggesting a more aggressive liquidity management strategy.",

In response, BMY adjusted its strategy by 2024 to proactively manage future exclusivity risks, including entering into settlements with generic manufacturers to control litigation uncertainty, as seen with Revlimid and lenalidomide. This approach was particularly evident as new patent challenges emerged in Finland and Slovakia, where BMY anticipated further early generic competition and considered strategic settlements to manage exposure.

          "chunk_text": "Abraxane Abraxane (paclitax el albumin-bound particles for injectable suspension) is a solvent-free protein-bound chemotherapy product that combines paclitaxel with  albumin  using  our  proprietary Nab technology platform, and is used to treat breast cancer,  NSCLC and pancreatic cancer, among others. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries primarily covering our products. We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn  the  pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. A product's market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes provided by regulatory exclusivity, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic or biosimilar copy. Regulatory exclusivity can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.\n\nWhen these patent rights and other forms of exclusivity expire and generic versions of a medicine are approved and marketed, there are often substantial and rapid declines in the sales of the original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic medicines on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific  aspects  of  the  law  governing  market  patent  protection  and  regulatory  ex clusivity  for  pharmaceuticals  vary  from  country  to  country.  The  following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovator company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, apply to the government to restore lost patent term by extending the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the  U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical product, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity as discussed below. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic ex clusivity.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor  seeking  to  launch  a  generic  substitute  of  a  chemical  innovative  drug  in  the  U.S.  must  file  an ANDA  with  the  FDA.  In  the ANDA,  the  generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.",

          "chunk_text": "a REMS program. The inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected regulatory approval and related launch date of a new product could negatively impact our revenues and earnings. In addition, if certain acquired pipeline programs are canceled or we believe their commercial prospects have  been  reduced,  we  may  recognize  material  non-cash  impairment  charges  for  those  programs.  Finally,  losing  key  molecules  and  intermediaries  or  our compound library through a natural or man-made disaster or act of sabotage could negatively impact the product development cycle.\n\nWe can provide no assurance when or whether any of our products under development will be approved or launched or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful. The public announcement of data from our clinical studies, or those of our competitors, or news of any developments related to our, or our competitors', products or late-stage compounds may cause significant volatility in our stock price and depending on the data, may result in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If the development of any of our key late-stage product candidates is delayed or discontinued or a clinical study does not meet one or more of its primary endpoints, our stock price could decline significantly and there may be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects. W e may also choose to no longer pursue certain programs from time to time as we periodically review our research and development programs and seek to prioritize our pipeline investments. This may result in further uncertainty as to when potential new products will be approved and commercialized. There can be no assurance that our key product candidates would prove to be safe and effective or as safe and effective as other competing products, or that, even if approved, any such products will become commercially successful for all approved indications.\n\n## We could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an innovative product' s commercial value is realized during its market exclusivity period. In the U.S. and in some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions are approved and marketed or when biosimilars are introduced (even if only for a competing product), there are usually very substantial and rapid declines in a product's revenues.\n\nMarket exclusivity for our products is based upon patent rights and certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. The scope of our patent rights, if any, varies from country to country and may also be dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in a country. The failure to obtain or maintain patent and other intellectual property rights, or limitations on the use or loss of such rights, could result in a rapid loss of sales for any affected products which could be material to  us.  In  some  countries,  including  certain  EU  member  states,  basic  patent  protections  for  our  products  may  not  exist  because  certain  countries  did  not historically offer the right to obtain specific types of patents, and/or we (or our licensors) did not file in those countries. In addition, the patent environment can be unpredictable, and the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty.  For example, for  Eliquis, generics have challenged the composition of matter patents and related  SPCs in various jurisdictions, and trials have taken place, or are scheduled to take place, in certain  European countries. While these legal proceedings are pending, generic manufacturers have begun marketing generic versions of Eliquis in certain EU countries and may seek to market generic versions of Eliquis in other EU countries prior to the expiration date of applicable patents and related SPCs. Furthermore, manufacturers of innovative drugs as well as generic drug manufacturers may be able to design their products around our owned or licensed patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology. Absent relevant patent protection for a product, once the data exclusivity period expires, generic or alternative versions can be approved and marketed.\n\nGeneric and biosimilar product manufacturers as well as other groups seeking financial gain are also increasingly seeking to challenge patents before they expire, and we have faced and may continue to face earlier-than-expected competition for any products at any time. Patents covering our key products have been, and  are  likely  to  continue  to  be,  subject  to  validity,  enforceability  and  infringement  challenges  in  patent  litigations  and  post-grant  review  patent  office proceedings. Although we are confident in the strength of our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for generic drug companies to successfully challenge our rights and launch their generic versions of our drugs prior to the expiration of our intellectual property rights. For example, following certain adverse judicial decisions in the UK, Finland and Slovakia, generic manufacturers have begun marketing generic versions of Eliquis in these countries, and may seek to market generic versions of Eliquis in additional countries in Europe, prior to the expiration of our patents, which may lead to additional infringement and invalidity actions involving Eliquis patents being filed in various countries in Europe. In addition, in order to avoid the uncertainty and expense of litigation, among other  reasons,  we  may  decide  to  enter  into  settlements  with  generic  manufacturers  that  permit  generic  market  entry  prior  to  the  expiration  of  our intellectual property rights. For example, as a result of patent settlements, generic entry for Revlimid in the UK began on January 18, 2022, and in various other European countries on February 18, 2022. Similarly, in the U.S., following patent settlements, certain companies have begun marketing generic lenalidomide pursuant to volume-limited licenses. The licenses will no longer be volume-limited beginning on January 31, 2026.",

      "answer": "Merck's 2023 strategic emphasis on alliance revenue growth, including an 8% increase in revenue from the Bayer collaboration, reflects a proactive shift toward diversifying revenue streams in anticipation of Keytruda's 2028 loss of U.S. market exclusivity. This is critical given that Keytruda and Gardasil/Gardasil 9 together accounted for 56% of total sales in 2023, making the company highly vulnerable to revenue declines once Keytruda's exclusivity ends.

      "answer": "In 2022, Merck granted licenses to generic manufacturers to enable production of molnupiravir in low- and middle-income countries, which likely contributed to increased global access and potentially impacted Merck's own sales volumes. This licensing strategy was part of a broader access approach with Ridgeback, including waiving royalties during the pandemic emergency period. By 2023, Merck's net sales of Lagevrio had dropped significantly from $5,684M in 2022 to $1,428M, indicating reduced demand or market saturation. Correspondingly, Merck's payables to Ridgeback dropped from $348M in 2022 to $113M in 2023, reflecting the reduced activity or financial obligations tied to the collaboration as sales declined. This shows that the earlier licensing strategy likely contributed to a more competitive global market for molnupiravir, which in turn influenced Merck\u2019s financial relationship with Ridgeback the following year.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, MDT reported $125 million in mutual funds measured using Level 1 inputs, while in fiscal year 2023, this amount decreased to $106 million. This indicates a reduction in the company's short-term investment exposure to mutual funds that are directly observable and actively traded. The decline aligns with a relatively stable use of Level 1 inputs overall, suggesting a strategic shift toward alternative investment vehicles such as equity and fixed income commingled trusts, which are measured at net asset value and increased in total fair value.",

      "question": "How did Amgen's collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. in 2022 evolve into the production and commercialization of BLINCYTO in 2024, and what were the financial implications of this partnership on Amgen's oncology product sales and R&D cost-sharing during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen had an ongoing collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd., which included profit and loss sharing on oncology product sales such as BLINCYTO in China. Amgen supplied these products and shared global R&D costs with BeiGene up to $1.25 billion. By 2024, Amgen was still producing BLINCYTO, as shown by its inclusion in Phase 3 clinical trials for Ph-negative B-ALL. During this time, Amgen recorded product sales from BeiGene of $259 million in 2024, up from $64 million in 2022, indicating a significant increase in commercialization activity. Additionally, net R&D cost recoveries from BeiGene rose from $199 million in 2022 to $122 million in 2024, showing a dynamic shift in cost-sharing and development responsibilities. This reflects a deepening of the partnership and its impact on Amgen\u2019s oncology portfolio performance.",

Under our collaboration, UCB has rights to lead commercialization for EVENITY in most countries in Europe. Amgen, as the principal, leads commercialization for EVENITY  and recognizes product sales in all other territories, including the United States. G lobal development costs and commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration are shared equally. Amgen manufactures and supplies EVENITY worldwide.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, global profit and loss share expenses were $547 million, $396 million and $255 million, respectively, and were recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net costs recovered from and due to UCB during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were not material.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nIn January 2020, we acquired an equity stake in BeiG ene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. For  additional  information  regarding  our  equity  investment  in  BeiG ene,  see  Note  10,  Investments.  Under  the  collaboration,  BeiG ene  began  selling  XG EV A  in  2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen would pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China of such products for a specified period. Amgen manufactures and supplies the collaboration products to BeiGene.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiG ene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash and development services of up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiG ene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiG ene will share profits and losses equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen also pays royalties to BeiGene.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net costs recovered from BeiG ene for oncology product candidates were $122 million, $109 million and $199 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, product sales from Amgen to BeiG ene under the collaboration were $259 million, $125 million and $64 million, respectively, and were recorded in Product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Profit and loss share expenses related to the initial product-specific commercialization period were not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.\n\nWe are in a collaboration and licensing agreement with Kyowa Kirin to jointly develop and commercialize rocatinlimab, an anti-OX40 fully human monoclonal antibody, worldwide, except in Japan. Rocatinlimab is for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, with potential for treatment of other autoimmune diseases.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we lead the global development, manufacture and commercialization of rocatinlimab, except in Japan. Kyowa Kirin will co-promote rocatinlimab with Amgen in the United States and have opt in rights to co-promote rocatinlimab in various other markets outside the United States, including in Europe and Asia.\n\nWe made an upfront payment of $400 million to Kyowa Kirin that was recognized in R&amp;D expense in the third quarter of 2021. Amgen and Kyowa Kirin share equally the global development costs, except in Japan, and the U.S. commercialization costs. Outside the United States and Japan, any commercialization costs incurred by Kyowa Kirin will be reimbursed by Amgen. We may also be required to make milestone payments of up to $850 million contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory events and commercial thresholds. We will also pay Kyowa Kirin significant double-digit royalties on global sales, except in Japan. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net costs recovered from Kyowa Kirin were $166 million, $93 million and $23 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Other\n\nIn addition to the collaborations discussed above, we have various other collaborations that are not individually significant to our business at this time. Pursuant to the terms of those agreements, we may be required to pay additional amounts, or we may receive additional amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones that in the aggregate could be significant. We may also incur or have reimbursed to us significant R&amp;D costs if a related product candidate were to advance to late-stage clinical trials. In addition, if any products related to these collaborations are approved for sale, we may be required to pay significant royalties, or we may receive significant royalties on future sales. The payments of these amounts, however, are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events that have high degrees of uncertainty of occurrence.",

      "question": "How did Amgen's strategic collaboration with BeiGene in 2022, particularly around BLINCYTO commercialization in China, influence Amgen's direct production focus on BLINCYTO by 2024, especially in light of the equal profit-sharing arrangement and potential reversion of product rights?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen entered into a strategic collaboration with BeiGene, under which BeiGene began selling BLINCYTO in China and shared profits and losses equally during the initial commercialization period. The agreement allowed for product rights to revert to Amgen after this phase, with Amgen then paying royalties to BeiGene on Chinese sales. By 2024, Amgen had refocused its internal pipeline to include BLINCYTO in Phase 3 trials for Ph-negative B-ALL, indicating a shift toward direct production and global development. This evolution suggests that Amgen may have regained control over BLINCYTO following the initial phase with BeiGene, aligning with the contractual provision for rights reversion and royalty-based compensation to BeiGene. The $2.8 billion investment in BeiGene in 2020 and the $1.25 billion R&D cost-sharing commitment further underscore the strategic intent behind this transition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Business Relationships\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we acquire product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&amp;D  capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product  base.  These arrangements  generally provide for nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees,  development  and  commercial-performance  milestone  payments,  cost  sharing,  royalty  payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\n\nTrade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we  generally  require  counterparties  to  execute  confidentiality  agreements  upon  commencement  of  a  business  relationship  with  us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in early 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash  and  development  services  of  up  to  $1.25  billion.  Upon  regulatory  approval,  BeiGene  will  assume  commercialization  rights  in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.\n\n## Novartis\n\nWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig. On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Part IVNote 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arrangement through December 31, 2021\n\nIn the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal,  recognized  product  sales  of  Aimovig  in  the  United  States,  shared  U.S.  commercialization  costs  with  Novartis  and  paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis held global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&amp;D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to  make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States.\n\n## Arrangement after January 1, 2022\n\nPursuant  to  the  amendment  effective  January  1,  2022,  Novartis  retains  the  ex-U.S.  Novartis  Rights  and  will  continue  to  pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig. Amgen and Novartis will continue to share development expenses worldwide.\n\nAmgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig worldwide.",

Such arrangements involve two or more parties that are both (i) active participants in the activity and (ii) exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity.\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into collaborative arrangements for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or  product  candidates.  These  collaborations  generally  provide  for  nonrefundable  upfront  license  fees,  development  and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Our collaboration arrangements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each arrangement is unique in nature. See Note 1, Summary  of  significant  accounting  policies,  for  additional  discussion  of  revenues  recognized  under  these  types  of  arrangements. Operating  expenses  for  costs  incurred  pursuant  to  these  arrangements  are  reported  in  their  respective  expense  line  items  in  the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of any payments due to or reimbursements due from our collaboration partners, with such reimbursements being recognized at the time the party becomes obligated to pay. Our significant arrangements are discussed below.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand  our  oncology  presence  in  China.

      "question": "How did the change in MRK's investment in MK-7962 (sotatercept) from 2022 to 2023 reflect in the company's patent protection strategy and expected exclusivity timeline for this drug candidate?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MRK had a $6.4 billion investment in MK-7962 (sotatercept) as part of its IPR&D portfolio, indicating a strong commitment to the drug's development. By 2023, this investment had progressed to the point where the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter in December 2023, signaling that the drug was nearing regulatory review. Concurrently, MRK secured granted patents covering methods of treating pulmonary arterial hypertension with MK-7962, which are set to expire in 2037 (absent PTE), providing a clear exclusivity timeline. This shows that MRK's initial financial stake in 2022 evolved into a more defined regulatory and intellectual property strategy by 2023, with a focus on securing long-term exclusivity to protect future revenue streams.",

Some of the more significant acquired intangibles, on a net basis, related to human health marketed products (included  in  products  and  product  rights  above)  at  December  31,  2021  include Reblozyl ,  $3.8  billion; Zerbaxa ,  $478  million; Gardasil/Gardasil 9, $191 million; Bridion , $145 million; Dificid , $145 million; Sivextro , $138 million; and Simponi , $101 million. Additionally, the Company had $5.0 billion of net acquired intangibles related to animal health marketed products at December 31, 2021,  of  which  $2.3  billion  relate  primarily  to  trade  names  obtained  through  the  2019  acquisition  of Antelliq  (see  Note  4). At December 31, 2021, IPR&amp;D primarily relates to MK-7962 (sotatercept), $6.4 billion, obtained through the acquisition of Acceleron in 2021 (see Note 4); MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $2.0 billion, obtained through the acquisition of ArQule in 2020 (see below and Note 4); and MK-7264 (gefapixant) $832 million, obtained through the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals in 2016. Some of the more significant net intangible assets included in licenses and other above at December 31, 2021 include Lynparza, $1.1 billion, related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca; Lenvima, $1.0 billion, related to a collaboration with Eisai; Adempas, $806 million related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer;  and  Verquvo,  $68  million,  also  related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer.  See  Note  5  for additional information related to the intangible assets associated with these collaborations.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  recorded  an  impairment  charge  of  $1.6  billion  within Cost  of  sales related  to Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for injection, a combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of certain bacterial infections. In December 2020, the Company temporarily suspended sales of Zerbaxa , and subsequently issued a product recall, following the identification of product sterility issues. The recall constituted a triggering event requiring the evaluation of the Zerbaxa intangible asset for impairment. The Company revised its cash flow forecasts for Zerbaxa utilizing certain assumptions around the return to market timeline and anticipated uptake in sales thereafter. These revised cash flow forecasts indicated that the Zerbaxa intangible  asset  value  was  not  fully  recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best  estimate  of  the  fair  value  of  the  intangible  asset  related  to Zerbaxa that,  when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above. The Company also wrote-off inventory of $120 million to Cost of sales in 2020 related to the Zerbaxa recall. A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nIn 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges related to marketed products and other intangibles of $705 million. Of this amount, $612 million related to Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate), a product for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by designated susceptible Gram-positive organisms. As part of a reorganization and reprioritization of its internal sales force, the Company made the decision to cease promotion of Sivextro in the U.S. market by the end of 2019. This decision resulted in reduced cash flow projections for Sivextro , which indicated that the Sivextro intangible asset value was not fully recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market  participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to Sivextro that, when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above.\n\nIPR&amp;D that  the  Company  acquires  through  business  combinations  represents  the  fair  value  assigned  to  incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. Amounts capitalized as IPR&amp;D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until",

Celgene, known for producing REVLIMID (AMGN_10k_2022.pdf, page 7), likely contributed its manufacturing infrastructure for this key drug. By 2023, REVLIMID had expanded into new therapeutic indications, including 1L Multiple Myeloma and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (BMY_10k_2023.pdf, page 11), suggesting that despite the earlier integration risks, BMY was able to stabilize and scale Celgene's production capabilities for this critical asset. However, the 2022 filings caution that even slight deviations in manufacturing could lead to product loss, indicating that the successful integration of Celgene\u2019s infrastructure was a prerequisite for REVLIMID\u2019s 2023 expansion.",

If we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors' products in the marketplace, this could have a material negative impact on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.\n\nOur product supply and related patient access has been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted by difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Some of the difficulties, delays and disruptions  include:  (i)  product  seizures  or  recalls  or  forced  closings  of  manufacturing  plants;  (ii)  our  failure,  or  the failure of any of our vendors or suppliers, to comply with cGMP and other applicable regulations or quality assurance guidelines  that  could  lead  to  manufacturing  shutdowns,  product  shortages  or  delays  in  product  manufacturing;  (iii) manufacturing, quality assurance/quality control, supply problems or governmental approval delays; (iv) the failure of a supplier,  including  sole  source  or  single  source  suppliers,  to  provide  us  with  the  necessary  raw  materials,  supplies  or finished goods within a reasonable timeframe and with required quality; (v) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with bulk active or finished product on time; (vi) construction or regulatory approval delays for new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for our biologics products, such as Opdivo;  (vii)  the  failure  to  meet  new  and  emerging  regulations  requiring  products  to  be  tracked  throughout  the distribution channels using unique identifiers to verify their authenticity in the supply chain; (viii) other manufacturing or distribution  issues,  including  limits  to  manufacturing  capacity  and  changes  in  the  types  of  products  produced,  such  as biologics, physical limitations or other business interruptions; and (ix) disruptions in supply chain continuity, including from market forces (such as the recent stress on global logistics), natural disasters (such as hurricanes), global disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), acts of war or terrorism or other unforeseeable or unavoidable events that materially impact one or more of our facilities or a critical supplier.\n\nIn addition, manufacturing processes for novel cell-based therapies, such as CAR T cell therapies, are still evolving, and our  processes  may  be  more  complicated  or  more  expensive  than  the  approaches  taken  by  our  current  and  future competitors.  Our  ability  to  source  raw  materials  and  supplies  used  to  manufacture  our  CAR  T  cell  therapies  and  to develop consistent and reliable manufacturing processes and distribution networks with an attractive cost of goods could impact future anticipated revenue and gross profit for our CAR T cell therapies. Furthermore, we may face challenges with  sourcing  raw  materials  and  supplies  for  clinical  and,  if  approved,  commercial  manufacturing.  Logistical  and shipment delays and other factors not in our control could prevent or delay the delivery of our product candidates and marketed products to patients. Additionally, we are required to maintain a complex chain of identity and custody with respect to patient material as such material enters into and moves through the manufacturing process. As a result, even slight deviations at any point in the production process for our CAR T cell therapies or in material used in our CAR T cell therapies could result in loss of product or regulatory remedial action, which could adversely affect our future anticipated revenues and/or profitability related to our CAR T cell therapies.\n\n## We may encounter difficulties integrating ours and Celgene's businesses and operations and, therefore, may not fully realize the projected benefits from our acquisition of Celgene.\n\nThe ultimate success of our acquisition of Celgene and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, including the expected cost savings and avoidance from synergies, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies, depends on, among other things, how effective we are in integrating the Bristol Myers Squibb and Celgene operations, products and employees.\n\nWe are in the process of integrating a large number of manufacturing, operational and administrative systems to achieve consistency  throughout  the  combined  company,  including  with  respect  to  human  capital  management,  portfolio rationalization,  finance  and  accounting  systems,  sales  operations  and  product  distribution,  pricing  systems  and methodologies,  cybersecurity  systems,  compliance  programs  and  internal  controls  processes.  This  integration  is  a complex, costly and time-consuming process. If any difficulties in the integration of our operations were to occur, they could adversely affect our business, including, among other ways, causing a failure to meet demand for our products, or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, alliance partners, creditors, clinical trial investigators and managers of our clinical trials.\n\nEvents outside our control, including changes in regulation and laws as well as economic trends, also could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from this acquisition.\n\n## Regulatory, Intellectual Property, Litigation, Tax and Legal Compliance Risks\n\n## Litigation  claiming  infringement  of  intellectual  property  may  adversely  affect  our  future  revenues  and  operating earnings.\n\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are, and in the future may be, involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, such as claims that our patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer or where third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of their",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen reported that the U.S. patent for Parsabiv (etelcalcetide)\u00ae covering 'Compound and pharmaceutical composition' was set to expire on 2/7/2031. By 2023, this same patent was still disclosed under the same category and territory, with no change in the expiration date. However, the 2023 filing included more detailed disclosures of other products and formulations, suggesting a broader IP strategy while maintaining the same expiration for Parsabiv\u2019s foundational composition. This indicates that while Amgen hasn't extended the core IP for Parsabiv, it may be focusing on secondary formulations or methods to extend market exclusivity.",

        "Hop 1: AMGN(2022) \u2192 Parsabiv (etelcalcetide)\u00ae: Amgen listed Parsabiv with a U.S. patent for 'Compound and pharmaceutical composition' expiring on 2/7/2031.",
        "Hop 2: Parsabiv (etelcalcetide)\u00ae \u2192 Compound and pharmaceutical composition: The product depends on this patent category for its core IP protection in the U.S.",
        "Hop 3: Compound and pharmaceutical composition \u2190 AMGN(2023): Amgen continued to disclose the same patent for Parsabiv under this category in 2023, with no change in expiration date but more context on other products."

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Private Sector Dynamics\n\nIn the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare providers significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion.\n\nFormulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels, and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in pricing and usage negotiation, and compete fiercely for formulary placement, not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy, safety profile, or patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. As payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and pricing, value-based agreements, where pricing is based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes, are another tool that may become increasingly prevalent. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. We expect these downward pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see \"- Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access - U.S.\"\n\n## Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights\n\n## Overview\n\nIntellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products, product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, as discussed below, for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.\n\nThe patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent), particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., major European countries, and Japan. These patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications, usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the Discovery Phase of the drug discovery process, which is described in the \"Research and Development\" section below. In general, national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:\n\n- Patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n- Patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to U.S. patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the FDA. To make up for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the FDA review process, a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration. Patent term restoration is limited by a formula and cannot be calculated until product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There is a five-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration for patents claiming inventions subject to a local review by a regulatory agency. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval). Also, in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, patent terms can be extended up to five years, depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors.",

      "question": "How did DHR's 2022 allocation to private equity funds influence the valuation methodology of its NAV-disclosed investments by 2024, particularly in terms of fund manager reporting practices and liquidity constraints?",
      "answer": "In 2022, DHR allocated a portion of its U.S. pension plan assets to private equity funds as part of a diversified investment strategy, with these investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient and subject to redemption limits of up to 90 days. By 2024, DHR's disclosures indicated that these private investments, including private equity, were increasingly valued based on NAV derived from fund manager reports, which incorporated discounted cash flows, earnings multiples, and third-party appraisals. This evolution in valuation methodology reflects a continued reliance on NAV as a proxy for fair value, but with greater emphasis on qualitative inputs from fund managers, likely due to the illiquid nature of these assets and the extended redemption periods (monthly to annually). This shows a deepening alignment with industry practices observed in UPS's 2024 disclosures, where NAV is used for alternative investments with limited liquidity and redemptions requiring advance notice.",

        "Hop 1: DHR(2022) \u2192 Private Equity Funds: DHR disclosed its U.S. pension plan invested in private equity funds as part of a diversified portfolio, with NAV used as a practical expedient and redemption limits of up to 90 days.",

This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan, and is based primarily on broad, publicly-traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. Long-term rate of return on asset assumptions for the non-U.S. plans were determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on the composition of assets and ranged from 0.3% to 5.0% in 2021 and 0.5% to 5.0% in 2020, with a weighted average rate of return assumption of 3.3% in 2021 and 3.4% in 2020.\n\n## Pension Plan Assets\n\nThe U.S. pension plan's goal is to maintain between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios, which are invested in individual equity securities or funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments, such as venture capital funds and partnerships. Asset holdings are periodically rebalanced when equity holdings are outside this range. The balance of the U.S. plan asset portfolio is invested in bond funds, real estate funds, various absolute and real return funds and private equity funds. Non-U.S. plan assets are invested in various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The value of the plan assets directly affects the funded status of the Company's pension plans recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company has certain investments that are valued using Net Asset Value ('NAV') as the practical expedient. In addition, certain of the investments valued using NAV as the practical expedient have limits on their redemption to monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually and require up to 90 days prior written notice. These investments valued using NAV consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds, partnerships, real estate, and other private investments, which allow the Company to allocate investments across a broad array of types of funds and diversify the portfolio.\n\nThe fair values of the Company's pension plan assets for both the U.S. and non-U.S. plans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, by asset category were as follows ($ in millions):\n\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

(3)\n\nThe FDA granted EUA for treatment with or without remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. (4)\n\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products, as well as a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity.

      "question": "How did the increase in state-level 340B Program legislation in 2024 impact Amgen's patient access challenges compared to 2023, particularly in light of Express Scripts' expanded negotiating leverage as a top PBM?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Amgen faced patient access challenges due to restrictive payer practices and increasing scrutiny of drug pricing, especially from PBMs like Express Scripts, which had significant negotiating leverage due to industry consolidation. By 2024, the situation intensified as eight states enacted 340B Program legislation, and at least 25 states considered similar laws, limiting Amgen\u2019s control over 340B drug distribution and further eroding pricing power. Express Scripts, as one of the top six integrated health plans and PBMs controlling 94% of all pharmacy prescriptions according to the 2024 FTC interim report, used its Rebate Management Organization to extract deeper discounts from Amgen, exacerbating the negative impact on product sales and patient access. This represents a transformation in the entity chain, where Amgen\u2019s access risks (2023) were amplified through the PBM channel (Express Scripts) in 2024 due to both regulatory and market shifts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN(2023) \u2192 Patient Access: Amgen faced increasing payer restrictions and cost containment measures that limited patient access to its products, especially for ENBREL, Otezla, Repatha, and Aimovig.",
        "Hop 2: Patient Access \u2192 Express Scripts: PBMs like Express Scripts exerted greater negotiating leverage due to market consolidation and formulary control, directly influencing patient access through rebate demands and utilization restrictions.",
        "Hop 3: Express Scripts \u2190 AMGN(2024): In 2024, Express Scripts further leveraged its position, especially with the expansion of 340B-related state laws, to extract deeper discounts, worsening Amgen\u2019s access and sales challenges."

Louisiana, Arkansas, West V irginia, Minnesota, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Maryland have enacted laws with mandates on manufacturers participating in the 340B Program, and, in 2024, no fewer than 25 states considered similar legislation. These bills vary, but typically include provisions on restricting a manufacturer's ability to direct drugs in 340B channels, recognizing 340B contract  pharmacies and a prohibition on requiring the inclusion of 340B claims modifiers.  In  March 2024, the  U.S.  Court of Appeals for the 8th  Circuit ruled that Arkansas' Act 1103, which prohibits drugmakers from restricting the acquisition or delivery of 340B drugs to covered entities and their contract pharmacies, was not preempted by the federal 340B statute. The decision contributed to an increase in the number of states considering similar legislation. In July 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi denied motions for a preliminary injunction in two cases challenging a similar law in Mississippi, finding that neither plaintiff had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. These orders are being appealed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. In September 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana dismissed a lawsuit challenging Louisiana's 340B contract pharmacy mandate law, and the U.S. District Court for the  District of  Maryland denied a motion for preliminary injunction challenging a similar law in Maryland. These lawsuits challenging states on their 340B contract pharmacy laws are subsequent to Genesis Health Care, Inc. v. Becerra, where the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina issued an order in November 2023 that enjoins the Health Resources and Services Administration from enforcing its more restrictive interpretation of who is considered a patient under the 340B Program, to the potential benefit of healthcare systems seeking to expand the application of 340B discounts.\n\nAdditionally, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida to move forward with its importation program proposal, though the state has not completed any significant steps towards importation within the one-year authorization window. Colorado, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and V ermont have also enacted state importation laws, and some have submitted plans for approval to the FDA. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs.\n\nUltimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n\n## -U.S. commercial payer actions have affected, and may continue to affect, access to and sales of our products\n\nPayers, including healthcare insurers,  PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from consolidations of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, are continuing to seek ways to further reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients' use of manufacturer commercial co-pay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. Payers, including PBMs, have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, and to also impose restrictions on access to, or usage of, our products (such as Step Therapy), require that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product, and/or chosen to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet their utilization criteria, and these requirements have served to limit patient access to Repatha treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers (including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans), and in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than paying their co-pay, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list  price.  However,  affordability  of  patient  out-of-pocket  co-pay  cost  has  limited,  and  may  continue  to  limit,  patient  use.  Further,  despite  these  net  and  list  price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and may seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions, such as changing formulary coverage for Repatha, that could reduce its sales. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, negatively affecting Repatha sales.\n\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in  the  United  States,  the  FTC's  interim  report  released  in  2024  showed  that  the  top  six   integrated  health  plans  and  PBMs  controlled  about  94%  of  all  pharmacy prescriptions. This high degree of consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mailorder pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers from our business. Each of CVS, Express Scripts and United Health G roup (among the top six integrated health plans and PBMs) have Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their leverage to negotiate deeper discounts on their behalf and for the benefit of their other customers. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage changes, plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse",

In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies).\n\nTotal product sales increased 19% in 2024, primarily driven by volume growth of 23%, partially offset by declines in net selling price of 2%. U.S. volume grew 26% and ROW volume grew 17%. Product sales from acquired Horizon products contributed $4.2 billion in 2024 compared to $954 million in 2023, with volume growth of 11% from our other brands, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, BLINCYTO and Prolia.\n\nFor 2025, we expect volume growth from certain brands to be partially offset by net selling price declines. Further, the first quarter of a year historically represents the  lowest  product  sales  quarter  for  the  year,  in  part  due  to  plan  changes,  insurance  reverifications  and  higher  co-pay  ex penses  as  U.S.  patients  work  through deductibles, particularly for products acquired through pharmacy benefit programs.\n\nUncertain macroeconomic conditions, changes in the healthcare ecosystem and geopolitical conflicts have the potential to introduce variability into product sales. Furthermore, product sales continue to be impacted by actions from governments and other entities to curb high inflation, provisions of the IRA, inappropriate expanded utilization of the 340B Program and growth in numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\n\nOther revenues increased for 2024, primarily driven by higher corporate partner revenue from licensed products and royalty income.\n\nOperating expenses increased for 2024, driven by higher amortization expense from Horizon acquisition-related assets, higher R&amp;D and SG &amp;A expenses, including expenses from the acquired Horizon business, and higher profit share and royalty expense.",

      "question": "How did the changes in patent protection timelines for Enbrel between 2022 and 2024 impact Amgen's strategic positioning of the product, particularly considering the expiration of key biologic exclusivity periods and the introduction of biosimilar competition?",
      "answer": "Amgen's strategic positioning of Enbrel evolved between 2022 and 2024 as the company navigated a shifting patent protection landscape. In 2022, Amgen expressed concerns over potential biosimilar competition due to regulatory changes that could shorten exclusivity periods for biologics, including the removal of the 10-year data exclusivity requirement from USMCA and ongoing FDA deliberations on 'umbrella exclusivity'. By 2024, the patent expiration schedule for Enbrel showed that while core U.S. patents covering the fusion protein and its formulation extended through 2029 and 2037 respectively, the earlier expiration of European patents in 2022 likely led to increased biosimilar pressure in that region. This timeline suggests Amgen may have shifted focus toward extending Enbrel's lifecycle in the U.S. through formulation patents while managing declining exclusivity protections in Europe, aligning with the company's broader concern about biosimilar-driven revenue erosion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN(2022) \u2192 Patent Protection: Amgen expressed concern over regulatory changes that could shorten exclusivity periods for biologics, including the removal of the 10-year data exclusivity requirement from USMCA and FDA deliberations on 'umbrella exclusivity'.",
        "Hop 2: Patent Protection \u2192 Enbrel: By 2024, Enbrel\u2019s U.S. patents covering fusion protein composition and formulations were set to expire in 2029 and 2037, while European patents expired in 2022, creating a regional disparity in protection.",
        "Hop 3: Enbrel \u2190 AMGN(2024): Amgen continued to list Enbrel as a key product in 2024, but with the European market now exposed to biosimilars post-2022 expiration, the company likely adjusted its strategy to maintain revenue through extended U.S. patent protections."

          "chunk_text": "products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  a  requirement  for  at  least  10  years  of  data  exclusivity  for  biologic  products.  Also,  the  FDA  is  considering  whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as 'umbrella exclusivity'). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does  not  apply  to  biological  reference  products  or  were  to  make  other  changes  to  the  exclusivity  period,  this  could  expose  us  to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition  through  policies  enabling  easier  generic  and  biosimilar  approval  and  commercialization,  including  efforts  to  lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential  reimbursement  policies  for  biosimilars  and  pass  new  laws  requiring  more  disclosure  in  the  FDA's  Orange  and  Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered  training  to  help  identify  prior  art,  and  seeking  USPTO's  views  on  practices  that  extend  market  exclusivities,  whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the PTAB on drug patents.\n\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents and unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product by an additional six months.\n\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first  state  to  have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against 'pay for delay' settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement  agreements  are  presumptively  anticompetitive.  The  law  may  result  in  prolonged  litigation  and  fewer  settlements.  Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.\n\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three  pharmaceutical  product  wholesaler  distributors:  McKesson  Corporation, AmerisourceBergen  Corporation  and  Cardinal  Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis  facilities  located  in  the  United  States  and  accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  all  EPOGEN sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs  now  oversee  a  substantial  percentage  of  total  covered  lives  in  the  United  States.  See Our  sales  depend  on  coverage  and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely  to  continue  to  affect,  our  profitability. The  three  largest  PBMs  in  the  United  States  are  now  part  of  major  health  insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing  volume.  Further,  if  one  of  our  significant  wholesale  distributors  encounters  financial  or  other  difficulties  and  becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&amp;D.\n\nAmgen invests heavily in R&amp;D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&amp;D projects yield approved and commercially viable products.

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen highlighted EVENITY's regulatory risk due to cardiovascular safety concerns observed in clinical trials, which led to post-marketing requirements and potential labeling restrictions. Under the collaboration with UCB, Amgen shared global development and commercialization profits and losses equally. By 2023, Amgen's cost-sharing with UCB increased significantly, with global profit and loss share expenses rising from $255 million in 2022 to $396 million in 2023. This increase indicates a more active commercialization phase for EVENITY, particularly in Europe where UCB led marketing efforts, despite the ongoing regulatory scrutiny. The growth in shared costs suggests that Amgen and UCB expanded their joint investment in EVENITY, likely to support market access and mitigate earlier regulatory risks.",

          "chunk_text": "full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product's labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  can  also  impose  post-marketing  pediatric  study  requirements.  Failure  to  fulfill  such  requirements  may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product's marketing authorization.\n\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events  reported  to  us  and  to  communicate  to  regulatory  agencies  these  adverse  events  and  safety  signals  regarding  our  products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in  combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory  agencies  determine  that  we  or  other  parties  (including  our  clinical  trial  investigators,  those  operating  our  patient  support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality  assessment  requirements,  we  may  become  subject  to  additional  inspections,  warning  letters  or  other  enforcement  actions, including fines,  marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product's approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:\n\n- revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;\n- requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;\n- post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;\n- product recalls of our approved products;\n- required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;\n- revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;\n- increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or\n- treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.\n\nFor example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated CV serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials  for  EVENITY  but  not  in  another,  larger  phase  3  study,  in  April  2019  the  FDA  approved  EVENITY  for  the  treatment  of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.\n\nIn addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently  manufactured,  marketed  and  sold  by  other  pharmaceutical  companies.  In  some  markets,  there  is  not  yet  a  legislative  or regulatory  pathway  for  the  approval  of  biosimilars.  In  the  United  States,  the  BPCIA  provided  for  such  a  pathway;  while  the  FDA continues to develop regulatory and scientific policies for biosimilars, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways, or changes in existing regulatory pathways, including degradation of regulatory standards, could result in delays or difficulties  in  getting  our  biosimilar  products  approved  by  regulatory  authorities,  subject  us  to  unanticipated  development  costs  or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have",

      "answer": "In 2023, BMY maintained a stake in Yervoy, which was nearing the end of its market exclusivity in 2025 in the U.S. and Japan, and 2026 in the EU. Yervoy was frequently combined with Opdivo for various oncology indications, as noted in BMY\u2019s 2023 10-K filing. By 2024, BMY secured a new FDA approval for Opdivo in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This expansion of Opdivo\u2019s therapeutic use suggests a strategic effort to extend the value of the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen before Yervoy\u2019s exclusivity expires, thereby maintaining oncology revenue momentum despite impending generic competition.",

In both years, the Tecentriq patent license agreement with Roche Group required Roche to pay single-digit royalties on worldwide net sales of Tecentriq through December 31, 2026, with the royalties shared between BMY and Ono consistent with their existing agreements. While the Keytruda patent license agreement showed a change in royalty rates from 6.5% to 2.5% starting in 2024, the Tecentriq agreement terms remained stable, with no indication of change in the royalty percentage or revenue sharing mechanics.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson had already established a $9 billion reserve (with a nominal value of $12 billion discounted at 4.41%) to resolve current and future talc claims, including those channeled through the Imerys bankruptcy. Imerys, along with other parties, was engaged in ongoing mediation efforts through December 2023. By early 2024, despite the continuation of mediation, J&J remained involved in the process, as evidenced by the court-ordered mediation in the securities class action case in February 2024, which was part of the broader legal environment shaped by the Imerys-related talc liability. This indicates that the company's significant financial exposure in 2023 carried forward into 2024 and influenced its continued strategic participation in legal resolutions, including mediation.",

          "chunk_text": "In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company's shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. The case was stayed in M ay 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in M ay 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court's order granting class certification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In February 2024, fact discovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending mediation. In M ay 2024, the parties participated in an unsuccessful mediation. In June 2024, at the parties' request, the Court lifted the stay for certain limited discovery, but otherwise kept the stay in place pending a decision from the Third Circuit on the 23(f) petition. Briefing on the 23(f) petition was completed in September 2024. In January 2025, the Third Circuit listed the appeal for oral argument in M arch 2025.\n\n## Matters concerning opioids\n\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURA GESIC, NUCY NTA  and NUCY NTA  ER. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal A bstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\n\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at trial or on appeal.\n\nIn July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims for up to $5.0 billion. A pproximately 70% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal fourth quarter 2024. A  few government entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve the hospital cases.\n\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as the cases brought by private litigants. In total, there are approximately 35 remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various state courts, 390 remaining cases in the Ohio multi-district litigation (MDL), and 4 additional cases in other federal courts.\n\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada. That action was certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada in January 2025. A dditional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed class action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against Janssen Inc. and other industry members in A pril 2024; and leave to appeal was denied in October 2024.\n\nStarting in November 2019, a series of shareholder derivative complaints were filed against the Company as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A s of September 2024, all the complaints had been dismissed, and all appeals exhausted.\n\n## Product liability\n\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability  for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n97",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen used a multiperiod excess earnings income approach to value Otezla's developed product technology rights, based on the present value of incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset. This valuation methodology implies a strategic expectation of long-term revenue generation from Otezla, consistent with its amortization over a weighted-average period of 8.5 years using the straight-line method. In 2023, Amgen received FDA approval for Otezla for the treatment of genital psoriasis, which expands the product's market potential and extends its lifecycle by opening a new therapeutic indication. The 2023 approval aligns with the long-term amortization schedule established in 2022, suggesting that Amgen's initial valuation methodology accounted for potential future indications beyond the original approved uses.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMGN disclosed that ENBREL faced significant competition, which directly impacted its sales outlook. By 2024, Pfizer's product Xeljanz emerged as a specific competitor to ENBREL in the U.S. market, indicating a strategic shift in the competitive landscape. This evolution suggests that AMGN had to contend with a new dimension of competition from a product produced by a company (Pfizer) that was not previously highlighted as a direct competitor in this therapeutic area.

      "question": "How did BMY's revenue trajectory differ in developing versus developed markets after losing market exclusivity for its chemical products, and what role did weaker patent enforcement in developing countries play in this differential decline?",
      "answer": "BMY observed that in developed markets, such as the U.S. and EU, revenue declines after losing market exclusivity were more rapid, with declines often occurring within a short period after generic entry. In contrast, revenue declines in developing countries were historically slower, as noted in the 2023 10-K filing. This difference was attributed to weaker patent enforcement and limited data package protection in developing countries, as outlined in the 2022 10-K and further elaborated in the 2023 filing. For example, in the U.S., a chemical product with five years of regulatory data protection could face generic competition immediately after expiration, while many developing countries lacked robust mechanisms to enforce exclusivity even during data protection periods. This structural weakness in developing markets allowed for a more gradual erosion of revenue, as generic uptake was slower due to less aggressive market entry and weaker regulatory enforcement.",

          "chunk_text": "The U.S., EU and Japan each provide regulatory data protection, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic copy. In certain markets where patent protection  and  other  forms  of  market  exclusivity  may  have  expired,  regulatory  data  protection  can  be  of  particular  importance. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data protection exclusivity on the basis of the competitor's own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to  that  marketed  by  the  innovator. When  these  patent  rights  and  other  forms  of  exclusivity  expire  and  generic versions  of  a  medicine  are  approved  and  marketed,  there  are  often  substantial  and  rapid  declines  in  the  sales  of  the  original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic competition on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity and data regulatory protection for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country. The following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the  innovator  may,  depending  on  a  number  of  factors,  apply  to  the  government  to  restore  lost  patent  term  by  extending  the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If  the  innovative  pharmaceutical  is  a  chemical  product,  the  company  files  an  NDA.  If  the  medicine  is  a  biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity. The type of application filed can affect regulatory data protection exclusivity rights as discussed below.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the U.S. must file an aNDA with the FDA. In the aNDA, the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The aNDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.\n\nAn innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an aNDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an aNDA and allege that  one  or  more  of  the  patents  listed  in  the  Orange  Book  under  an  innovator's  NDA  is  invalid,  unenforceable,  or  will  not  be infringed  by  the  generic  product. This  allegation  is  commonly  known  as  a  Paragraph  IV  certification. The  innovator  then  must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, aNDAs including Paragraph IV certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these aNDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines  approved  under  an  NDA  can  also  receive  several  types  of  regulatory  data  protection.  An  innovative  chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory data protection in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, as described above, a generic manufacturer may file its aNDA after the fourth year of the five-year regulatory data protection period. A pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an NDA, but is approved in, for example, a new formulation or a new route of administration, but not  for  the  drug  itself,  or  for  a  new  indication  on  the  basis  of  new  clinical  studies,  may  receive  three  years  of  regulatory  data protection for that formulation, route of administration, or indication.",

          "chunk_text": "Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product, which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However, in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:\n\n- Regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period of data package protection depends on the country. For example, the period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics as described below), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent.\n- Under the BPCIA, the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, subject to certain conditions.\n- In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusivity\" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data protection and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant patents, to the extent these protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity attaches to the term of any relevant patent, pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity-i.e., a bar to generic or biosimilar approval, not a patent right.\n- Under the U.S. orphan drug law, a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive \"orphan\" designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits, orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric exclusivity, the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents.\n\nOutside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely, and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization, more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of \"flexibilities\" allowed under the agreement. Thus, some types of patents, such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules, are not available in certain developing countries. Further, many developing countries, and some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in TRIPs.\n\n## Our Intellectual Property Portfolio\n\nWe consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations-particularly with respect to those products discussed below-to be important to our operations. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold patents on manufacturing processes, formulations, devices, or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below. For approved products, dates include, where applicable, pending or granted patent term extensions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer capitalized $500 million in Comirnaty sales milestones owed to BioNTech, reflecting the financial depth of their partnership around the vaccine. By 2024, this partnership had resulted in shared legal exposure when GSK and Promosome filed lawsuits alleging Comirnaty infringed multiple U.S. and European patents. These legal actions directly tied Pfizer and BioNTech together in defense of Comirnaty, showing that the financial obligations from 2022 had evolved into joint legal liabilities by 2024. This demonstrates how Pfizer's financial alignment with BioNTech also bound them to the product's intellectual property risks over time.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount primarily reflects $500 million of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. (a)\n\nThe decrease is primarily due to amortization, partially offset by the capitalization of the Comirnaty milestones described above. (b)\n\n## Developed Technology Rights\n\nDeveloped technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\n\n## Brands\n\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\n\n## IPR&amp;D\n\nIPR&amp;D assets represent R&amp;D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS disclosed that its investments in private equity funds were accounted for using the equity method, with their carrying values based on NAV provided by fund managers, typically reported with up to a three-month lag. CVS also reviewed these investments for impairment quarterly. By 2024, CVS continued to rely on NAV as a practical expedient for valuing these investments, consistent with broader accounting practices observed in the UPS 2024 filing, which emphasized NAV derived from audited financial reports of the underlying partnerships. However, in 2024, CVS specifically noted that unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products were credited directly to contract holders' accounts and not reflected in shareholders' equity, a continuation of the prior policy but now more explicitly aligned with the use of NAV as a valuation proxy. This reflects a more structured and transparent alignment with industry practices for valuing alternative investments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other Investments\n\nOther investments consist primarily of the following:\n\n- Private equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value of the investment is based on the value of the Company's equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by the fund managers, these investments are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least quarterly and monitors their performance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the Company becomes aware of an impairment of a limited partnership's investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership's financial statements at the financial statement date, an impairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited partnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.\n- Investment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real estate investment is considered held-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company generally estimates fair value using net operating income and applying a capitalization rate in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time of the sale, the difference between the sales price and the carrying value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss.\n- Privately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes. Additionally, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ('FHLBB'), a subsidiary of the Company is required to purchase and hold shares of the FHLBB. These shares are restricted and carried at cost.\n\n## Net Investment Income\n\nNet investment income on the Company's investments is recorded when earned and is reflected in the Company's net income (other than net investment income on assets supporting experience-rated products). Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder, not the Company, assumes investment and other risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investment performance on experience-rated products is allocated to contract holders' accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does not impact the Company's net income (as long as the contract's minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large case pensions' experience-rated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders' accounts through a charge to benefit costs. The contract holders' accounts are reflected in policyholders' funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experiencerated products) are included as a component of net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized capital gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis. Purchases and sales of debt and equity securities and alternative investments are reflected on the trade date. Purchases and sales of mortgage loans and investment real estate are reflected on the closing date.\n\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting large case pensions' experience-rated products are not included in realized capital gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and instead are credited directly to contract holders' accounts. The contract holders' accounts are reflected in policyholders' funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nUnrealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are reflected in shareholders' equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting large case pensions' experience-rated products are credited directly to contract holders' accounts. The contract holders' accounts are reflected in policyholders' funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company's use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

Since contract holders bear the investment risk of these assets, a corresponding Separate Accounts liability has been established equal to the assets. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income and capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets accrue directly to such contract holders.

Deposits, withdrawals, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity or cash flows.\n\nSeparate Accounts assets include debt and equity securities. The valuation methodologies used for these assets are similar to the methodologies described above in this Note 5 ''Fair V alue.'' Separate Accounts assets also include investments in common/collective trusts that are carried at fair value. Common/collective trusts invest in other investment funds otherwise known as the underlying funds. The Separate Accounts' interests in the common/collective trust funds are based on the fair values of the investments of the underlying funds and therefore are classified in Level 2. The assets in the underlying funds primarily consist of equity securities, U.S. corporate securities and U.S. government securities.

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS disclosed that its investments in common/collective trusts were valued at net asset value (NAV) per share/unit and were classified in Level 2 due to their fair value being based on the underlying funds\u2019 investments, which primarily consisted of equity securities. In 2023, the same valuation methodology was maintained, with the assets in the underlying funds still primarily consisting of equity securities. However, the continued emphasis on NAV valuation suggests a sustained exposure to equity-based funds, as these trusts invest in other investment funds (underlying funds) whose assets are largely in equities. This consistent methodology implies that CVS's exposure to equity-based underlying funds remained structurally similar year-over-year, with no indication of a strategic shift in asset composition.",

In addition, we acquire product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&amp;D  capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product  base.  These arrangements  generally provide for nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees,  development  and  commercial-performance  milestone  payments,  cost  sharing,  royalty  payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\n\nTrade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we  generally  require  counterparties  to  execute  confidentiality  agreements  upon  commencement  of  a  business  relationship  with  us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in early 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash  and  development  services  of  up  to  $1.25  billion.  Upon  regulatory  approval,  BeiGene  will  assume  commercialization  rights  in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.\n\n## Novartis\n\nWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig. On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Part IVNote 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arrangement through December 31, 2021\n\nIn the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal,  recognized  product  sales  of  Aimovig  in  the  United  States,  shared  U.S.  commercialization  costs  with  Novartis  and  paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis held global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&amp;D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to  make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States.\n\n## Arrangement after January 1, 2022\n\nPursuant  to  the  amendment  effective  January  1,  2022,  Novartis  retains  the  ex-U.S.  Novartis  Rights  and  will  continue  to  pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig. Amgen and Novartis will continue to share development expenses worldwide.\n\nAmgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig worldwide.",

Collaborations\n\nA collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity. Such arrangements involve two or more parties that are both (i) active participants in the activity and (ii) exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity.\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into collaborative arrangements for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or  product  candidates.  These  collaborations  generally  provide  for  nonrefundable  upfront  license  fees,  development  and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Our collaboration arrangements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each arrangement is unique in nature. See Note 1, Summary  of  significant  accounting  policies,  for  additional  discussion  of  revenues  recognized  under  these  types  of  arrangements. Operating  expenses  for  costs  incurred  pursuant  to  these  arrangements  are  reported  in  their  respective  expense  line  items  in  the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of any payments due to or reimbursements due from our collaboration partners, with such reimbursements being recognized at the time the party becomes obligated to pay. Our significant arrangements are discussed below.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand  our  oncology  presence  in  China.  For  additional  information  regarding  our  equity  investment  in  BeiGene,  see  Note  9, Investments. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in early 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.",

      "question": "How did the change in AbbVie's collaboration cost-sharing arrangement with Janssen Biotech in 2023 impact the financial performance of Imbruvica in 2024, particularly in light of the U.S. government pricing regulation under the Inflation Reduction Act?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AbbVie's collaboration with Janssen Biotech involved a cost-sharing arrangement where Janssen covered approximately 60% of development costs and AbbVie 40%. This joint development and commercialization agreement allowed both parties to share pre-tax profits and losses equally. However, in 2024, the U.S. government included Imbruvica in the list of products subject to price regulation under the Inflation Reduction Act, which significantly reduced future cash flow projections. This led AbbVie to record a $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge for Imbruvica\u2019s intangible asset, reflecting a sharp decline in its fair value from $4.0 billion to $1.9 billion. The earlier cost-sharing benefits with Janssen were not sufficient to offset the financial impact of the new pricing constraints, highlighting a shift from collaborative investment to asset impairment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABBV(2023) \u2192 Janssen Biotech: AbbVie shared 40% of development costs and 50% of profits with Janssen Biotech for Imbruvica.",
        "Hop 2: Janssen Biotech \u2192 Imbruvica: Janssen had exclusive rights to commercialize Imbruvica outside the U.S. and co-exclusive rights within the U.S., with shared development and marketing responsibilities.",
        "Hop 3: Imbruvica \u2190 ABBV(2024): Imbruvica was selected under the Inflation Reduction Act for government-set pricing, triggering a $2.1 billion impairment charge due to reduced fair value."

          "chunk_text": "\n## Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nThe increase in definite-lived intangible assets during 2024 was primarily due to the acquisition of ImmunoGen. The intangible assets will be amortized using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the acquisitions.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the company made a decision to reduce current sales and marketing investment related to both CoolSculpting, a body contouring technology for aesthetic nonsurgical fat reduction, and Liletta, an on-market women's health product. Each of these strategic decisions contributed to significant decreases in the estimated future cash flows for the respective products and represented triggering events that required an evaluation of the underlying definite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The company used a discounted cash flow analysis for both products. For CoolSculpting, the fair value of $290 million was lower than the carrying value of $1.3 billion resulting in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. For Liletta, the fair value of $241 million was lower than the carrying value of $561 million resulting in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.4 billion to costs of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn August 2023, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the company's oncology product Imbruvica sold in the United States (U.S.) was included on the l i s t of products subject to government-set prices by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. The selection resulted in a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite-lived intangible asset for i mpairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of $1.9 billion, which was lower than the carrying value of $4.0 billion and resulted in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount as of August 29, 2023. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $2.1 billion to cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn September 2022, the company made a strategic decision to reduce ongoing sales and marketing investment related to Vuity, an on-market product to treat presbyopia. This strategic decision contributed to a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite lived-intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the intangible asset resulting in a full impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $770 million to cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022.\n\nFair value measurements for the above evaluations were based on Level 3 inputs including estimated net revenues, cost of products sold, R&amp;D costs, selling and marketing costs and discount rate.\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $7.6 billion in 2024, $7.9 billion in 2023 and $7.7 billion in 2022 and was included i n cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did Amgen's strategy to address payer-imposed prior authorization requirements for Repatha evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what impact did this have on patient access and product sales given the increased payer concentration during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen responded to payer-imposed prior authorization requirements by reducing the net price of Repatha through greater discounts and rebates, particularly for PBMs administering Medicare Part D plans, and introduced new National Drug Codes to lower the list price for patients, especially those on Medicare. Despite these efforts, prior authorization and other utilization management criteria continued to limit patient access and negatively affect Repatha sales. By 2024, with the top six integrated health plans and PBMs controlling about 94% of all pharmacy prescriptions in the U.S., Amgen faced even greater payer leverage, leading to intensified use of prior authorization and step therapy. These stricter utilization management practices, combined with increased payer concentration, further constrained Amgen's ability to ensure broad patient access and maintain product sales growth for Repatha and other competitive products like ENBREL, which was also subject to new Medicare price-setting provisions that would take effect in 2026.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN(2022) \u2192 Payers: Amgen reduced Repatha's net price and introduced new NDCs to improve affordability after payer-imposed prior authorization and high co-pays led to prescription abandonment, especially among Medicare patients.",
        "Hop 2: Payers \u2192 Prior Authorization: Payers increasingly used prior authorization and step therapy to restrict access to Repatha, requiring physicians to demonstrate medical necessity before coverage was granted.",
        "Hop 3: Prior Authorization \u2190 AMGN(2024): By 2024, with 94% of U.S. prescriptions controlled by the top six payers, Amgen faced intensified prior authorization requirements and formulary restrictions, which limited product usage and sales, especially for Repatha and ENBREL under new Medicare pricing rules."

With  increasing  frequency,  payers  are  adopting  benefit  plan  changes  that  shift  a  greater  proportion  of  drug  costs  to  patients.  Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and more significant  limitations  on  patients'  use  of  manufacturer  commercial  copay  assistance  programs.  Further,  government  regulation  of payers may affect these trends. For example, CMS finalized a policy in May 2020 (for plan years starting on or after January 1, 2021, and  remains  standing  policy  for  2022)  that  has  caused  commercial  payers  to  more  widely  adopt  copay  accumulator  adjustment programs. Payers have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their  formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as Step Therapy, or requiring that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mailorder  pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies. Payers have also chosen to exclude certain  indications  for  which  our  products  are  approved  or  chosen  to  exclude  coverage  entirely.  For  example,  some  payers  require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria,  and  these  requirements  have  limited,  and  may  continue  to  limit,  patient  access  to  Repatha  treatment.  In  an  effort  to  reduce barriers  to  access,  we  reduced  the  net  price  of  Repatha  by  providing  greater  discounts  and  rebates  to  payers,  including  PBMs  that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use. For example, in late 2018 and early 2019, in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare, and on December 31,  2019,  we  discontinued  the  higher  list  price  option  for  Repatha.  Despite  these  net  and  list  price  reductions,  some  payers  have restricted,  and  may  continue  to  restrict,  patient  access  and  have  and  may  continue  to  change  formulary  coverage  for  Repatha,  seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, and negatively affect Repatha sales.\n\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements  and  limiting  patient  access  and  usage.  For  example,  in  the  United  States,  as  of  the  beginning  of  2021,  the  top  five integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 85% of all pharmacy prescriptions. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers, and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, CVS, Express Scripts and United Health Group, respectively, each created Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their respective leverage to negotiate deeper discounts. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial  payers  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  product  sales,  business  and  results  of  operations.  Policy  reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or  consequences  for  our  business  and  how  we  interact  with  these  entities.  See Concentration  of  sales  at  certain  of  our  wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\n-Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products\n\nOutside the United States, we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Part I, Item 1.  Business-Reimbursement. IRP has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external  benchmark  of  a  product's  price  in  other  countries.  IRP  policies  can  change  quickly  and  frequently  and  may  not  reflect differences  in  the  burden  of  disease,  indications,  market  structures,  or  affordability  differences  across  countries  or  regions.  Other expenditure control practices, including but not limited to the use of revenue clawbacks, rebates and percentage caps on price increases, are  used  in  various  foreign  jurisdictions  as  well.  In  addition,  countries  may  refuse  to  reimburse  or  may  restrict  the  reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA's approval of Repatha for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for Repatha in France prior to 2020 was limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with HoFH) following a national health technology assessment, which had limited our efforts in France to expand Repatha access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region.

TEPEZZA  and  KRY STEXXA  may  face  competition  from competitor medicines currently in clinical trials. See TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA sections above and Government Regulation-Regulation of Orphan Medicines .\n\n## Reimbursement\n\nSales of our products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare; and their efforts have intensified, in part, as a result of uncertain macroeconomic conditions, rising healthcare costs and pressures on healthcare budgets. Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers have been and continue to be more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and are scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. For example, as discussed below, payers are increasingly using stricter utilization management criteria, such as prior authorization and step therapy, to contain or reduce costs. These pressures become intensified when our products become subject to competition, including from biosimilars.\n\nIn the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and PBMs are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates or discounts to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and PBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the 340B Program. Further, inappropriate expanded utilization of the 340B Program has had a negative impact on the Company's financial performance.\n\nBoth  private  and  some  government  payers  use  formularies  to  manage  access  to  and  utilization  of  drugs. A  drug's  inclusion  and  favorable  positioning  on  a formulary are essential to ensure patients have full access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria (such as prior authorization and step therapy) before a patient may get access to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, in the United States, the top six integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 94% of all pharmacy prescriptions. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or ex clude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL, Otezla, Repatha and Aimovig, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position.\n\nIn addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers in both of the major U.S. political parties have supported policies to lower drug costs. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability .  For ex ample, in 2022, the IRA was enacted and includes provisions requiring that beginning in 2026, mandatory price setting be introduced in Medicare for certain drugs paid for under Parts B and D, whereby manufacturers must accept a price established by the government or face penalties on all U.S. sales (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20 in 2029 and subsequent years such that by 2031 approximately 100 drugs could be subject to such set prices). The Medicare price setting process began in August 2023 when CMS announced the first 10 drugs for Medicare price setting, which includes ENBREL, currently a product that generates considerable revenue for the Company. On July 30, 2024, CMS set a price for ENBREL in Medicare Part D that is significantly lower than the currently applicable price, effective beginning on January 1, 2026.

The FDA's clinical hold is based on observations of decreases in total lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts in some participants receiving islatravir in clinical studies. Merck previously announced it had stopped dosing in the Phase 2 IMAGINE-DR clinical trial of islatravir in combination with MK-8507 (MK-8591-013) and paused enrollment in the oncemonthly Phase 3 PrEP studies, (MK-8591-022 and MK-8591-024). With the FDA's clinical hold, no new studies may be initiated. Additionally, Merck and Gilead have made the decision to stop all dosing of participants in the Phase 2 clinical study evaluating an oral-weekly combination treatment regimen of islatravir and Gilead's investigational lenacapavir in people living with HIV who are virologically  suppressed  on  antiretroviral  therapy.  This  decision  follows  the  joint  announcement  on  November  23,  2021  of  a temporary hold on further enrollment and screening in the study, which commenced in October 2021. The two companies will assess whether a different dosing of islatravir in combination with lenacapavir may provide a once-weekly oral therapy option for people  living  with  HIV.  Merck  and  Gilead  remain  committed  to  their  collaboration,  which  aims  to  develop  long-acting  new treatment options to address the unmet needs for people living with HIV.\n\nMK-7962, sotatercept, is a potentially first-in-class therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sotatercept  is  in  clinical  trials  as  an  add-on  to  current  standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  PAH.  Sotatercept  was  obtained  in connection with Merck's acquisition of Acceleron Pharma Inc. in 2021.\n\nMK-1654,  clesrovimab,  is  a  respiratory  syncytial  virus  (RSV)  monoclonal  antibody  that  is  being  evaluated  for  the prevention of RSV medically attended lower respiratory tract infection in infants and certain children over 2 years of age.\n\nIn April 2021, Merck announced the discontinuation of development of MK-7110 which was being evaluated for the treatment  of  hospitalized  patients  with  COVID-19.  Merck  obtained  MK-7110  in  December  2020  through  its  acquisition  of OncoImmune, a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. In 2021, Merck received feedback from the FDA that additional data would be needed to support a potential EUA application and therefore the Company did not expect MK-7110 would become  available  until  the  first  half  of  2022.  Given  this  timeline  and  the  technical,  clinical  and  regulatory  uncertainties,  the availability of a number of medicines for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and the need to concentrate Merck's resources on accelerating  the  development  and  manufacture  of  the  most  viable  therapeutics  and  vaccines,  Merck  decided  to  discontinue development of MK-7110 for the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nIn September 2021, the FDA approved updated labeling for Steglatro, Steglujan and Segluromet, medicines for adults with type 2 diabetes, to include the primary efficacy and safety results from the VERTIS CV trial, which assessed the effect of Steglatro compared with placebo on cardiovascular outcomes in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The FDA issued a CRL concerning the Company's application for a new indication, based on additional results from the VERTIS CV trial, to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.

      "question": "How did Amgen's use of interest rate swap contracts in 2022 relate to the repayment of the 3.625% 2024 Notes in 2024, and what does this reveal about their debt management strategy over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen disclosed interest rate swap contracts with a fair value of $66 million in assets and $15 million in liabilities, indicating active hedging of fixed-rate debt. By 2024, these swaps were used to convert fixed-rate coupons to floating-rate SOFR-based coupons, specifically hedging $6.7 billion in long-term debt. Of this, $1.4 billion in interest rate swaps matured in 2024 in connection with the repayment of the 3.625% 2024 Notes. This aligns with Amgen repaying the full $1.4 billion principal of those notes in 2024, showing a coordinated strategy where derivative instruments were used to manage interest rate exposure in advance of scheduled debt maturities. The evolution from holding swaps as part of a broader hedging strategy in 2022 to their direct linkage with the repayment of specific notes in 2024 suggests a deliberate, time-phased approach to debt management.",

These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. For information regarding the terms of these contracts, see Note 19, Derivative instruments.\n\n## Cross-currency swaps\n\nTo hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts. The terms of these contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2024, effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayments on our 2.00% 2026 euro Notes, 5.50% 2026 pound sterling Notes and 4.00% 2029 pound sterling Notes from euros and pounds sterling to U.S. dollars.

The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $1.25 billion with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. G enerally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) SOFR plus 1.01% or (ii) the highest of (A) the administrative agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month SOFR plus 1.1%. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.\n\nIn February 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary",

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie identified Cardinal Health, Inc. as one of its three key U.S. wholesalers, noting that if any of these distributors faced financial difficulties, it could negatively impact AbbVie\u2019s business through delayed or uncollected receivables or reduced sales. By 2024, AbbVie continued to rely heavily on the same three wholesalers, which accounted for 81% of total net accounts receivable\u2014unchanged from the prior year. The lack of diversification in its distribution network, despite ongoing industry-wide pressures such as increased pricing competition and payment term risks from concentrated wholesaler power, suggests that AbbVie did not materially alter its distribution strategy between 2022 and 2024. This continuity implies a persistent exposure to wholesaler concentration risk, with no evidence of strategic shifts to reduce dependency or diversify its U.S. distribution channels during this period.",

The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected.\n\n## AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\n\nAbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.\n\nAdditionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate.\n\n## AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties.\n\nIn 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  a  requirement  for  at  least  10  years  of  data  exclusivity  for  biologic  products.  Also,  the  FDA  is  considering  whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as 'umbrella exclusivity'). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does  not  apply  to  biological  reference  products  or  were  to  make  other  changes  to  the  exclusivity  period,  this  could  expose  us  to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition  through  policies  enabling  easier  generic  and  biosimilar  approval  and  commercialization,  including  efforts  to  lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential  reimbursement  policies  for  biosimilars  and  pass  new  laws  requiring  more  disclosure  in  the  FDA's  Orange  and  Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered  training  to  help  identify  prior  art,  and  seeking  USPTO's  views  on  practices  that  extend  market  exclusivities,  whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the PTAB on drug patents.\n\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents and unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product by an additional six months.\n\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first  state  to  have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against 'pay for delay' settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement  agreements  are  presumptively  anticompetitive.  The  law  may  result  in  prolonged  litigation  and  fewer  settlements.  Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.\n\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three  pharmaceutical  product  wholesaler  distributors:  McKesson  Corporation, AmerisourceBergen  Corporation  and  Cardinal  Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis  facilities  located  in  the  United  States  and  accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  all  EPOGEN sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs  now  oversee  a  substantial  percentage  of  total  covered  lives  in  the  United  States.  See Our  sales  depend  on  coverage  and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely  to  continue  to  affect,  our  profitability. The  three  largest  PBMs  in  the  United  States  are  now  part  of  major  health  insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing  volume.  Further,  if  one  of  our  significant  wholesale  distributors  encounters  financial  or  other  difficulties  and  becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&amp;D.\n\nAmgen invests heavily in R&amp;D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&amp;D projects yield approved and commercially viable products.

      "answer": "In 2022, MRK disclosed the material importance of patent rights to maintaining market exclusivity for its pharmaceutical products, emphasizing that loss of patent protection typically leads to significant sales declines due to generic competition. In early 2023, the key U.S. patent for Januvia expired; however, favorable court rulings and settlement agreements extended market exclusivity in the U.S. for Januvia and Janumet until May 2026, and for Janumet XR until July 2026. Despite this extension, in 2024, MRK experienced a 33% decline in global sales of Januvia and Janumet, primarily driven by lower U.S. pricing and demand due to competitive pressures, as well as the ongoing impact of lost exclusivity in Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Canada. The company also faced additional regulatory pressures from the IRA\u2019s government price-setting program, which is expected to further impact sales starting in 2026. Thus, while patent litigation and settlements temporarily preserved market exclusivity in the U.S., the erosion of exclusivity in other regions and regulatory changes contributed to significant sales declines by 2024.",

Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company presently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. The Company's business, financial condition, results  of  operations,  cash  flow  or  prospects  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  any  of  these  risks. This  Form  10-K  also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's results could materially differ from those anticipated  in  these  forward-looking  statements  as  a  result  of  certain  factors,  including  the  risks  it  faces  described  below  and elsewhere. See 'Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results' below.\n\n## Risks Related to the Company's Business\n\n## The  Company  is  dependent  on  its  patent  rights,  and  if  its  patent  rights  are  invalidated  or  circumvented,  its business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company's marketing of human health and animal health products in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Patents covering products that it has introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the successful marketing and sale of its products. The Company seeks patents  covering  each  of  its  products  in  each  of  the  markets  where  it  intends  to  sell  the  products  and  where  meaningful  patent protection is available.\n\nEven if the Company succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate  or  circumvent  its  patents  and  patent  applications.  It  is  important  for  the  Company's  business  to successfully assert and defend the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for its products. The Company is often involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or claims by third parties of infringement against the Company. The Company asserts and defends its patents both within and outside the U.S., including by filing claims of infringement against other parties. See Item  8.  'Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,'  Note  11.  'Contingencies  and  Environmental  Liabilities'  below.  In particular, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file abbreviated NDAs with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of the Company's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by the Company. The Company  normally  responds  by  asserting  its  patent  with  a  lawsuit  alleging  patent  infringement.  Patent  litigation  and  other challenges  to  the  Company's  patents  are  costly  and  unpredictable  and  may  deprive  the  Company  of  market  exclusivity  for  a patented  product  or,  in  some  cases,  third-party  patents  may  prevent  the  Company  from  marketing  and  selling  a  product  in  a particular geographic area.\n\nAdditionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of  national  emergencies  or  in  other  circumstances,  which  could  diminish  or  eliminate  sales  and  profits  from  those  regions  and negatively  affect  the  Company's  results  of  operations.  Further,  court  decisions  relating  to  other  companies'  patents,  potential legislation in both the U.S. and certain foreign markets relating to patents, as well as regulatory initiatives may result in a more general weakening of intellectual property protection.\n\nIf  one  or  more  important  products  lose  patent  protection  in  profitable  markets,  sales  of  those  products  are  likely  to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available. The Company's results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until the Company has launched commercially successful products that replace the lost sales. In addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties  in  the  market  that  negatively  affect  product  cash  flows,  the  Company  may  recognize  material  non-cash  impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.\n\nA chart  listing  the  patent  protection  for  certain  of  the  Company's  marketed  products,  and  U.S.  patent  protection  for candidates in Phase 3 clinical development is set forth above in Item 1. 'Business - Patents, Trademarks and Licenses.'\n\n## As the Company's products lose market exclusivity, the Company generally experiences a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products.\n\nThe Company depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights for its products for some period of time.

          "chunk_text": "\nWe own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries primarily covering our products. We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which  the  product  has  market  exclusivity. A  product's  market  exclusivity  is  generally  determined  by  two  forms  of  intellectual property:  patent  rights  held  by  the  innovator  company  and  any  regulatory  forms  of  exclusivity  to  which  the  innovative  drug  is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to  exclude  others  from  practicing  an  invention  related  to  the  medicine.  Patents  may  cover,  among  other  things,  the  active ingredient(s),  various  uses  of  a  drug  product,  pharmaceutical  formulations,  drug  delivery  mechanisms  and  processes  for  (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory data protection exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, in the U.S., EU, Japan and certain other countries, RDP exclusivity rights are offered as incentives for research on medicines for rare diseases, or orphan drugs, and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. These incentives can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.",

A s a result of this provision, the Company paid state M edicaid programs more in rebates than it received on M edicaid sales of Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR in 2024.\n\nIn early 2025, M erck lowered the list price of the Januvia family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount M erck pays to M edicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing, which will be partially offset by continuing volume declines. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products in 2025 compared with 2024.\n\nWhile the key U.S. patent for Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see  Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that Januvia and Janumet will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until M ay  2026 and Janumet XR will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company's sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA . A dditionally , i n 2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Januvia would be included in the first y ear of the IRA 's Program. Pursuant to the IRA 's Program, a government price was set for Januvia , which will become effective on January 1, 2026. A lso, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Janumet and Janumet XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA 's Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA 's Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). A s a result of the anticipated patent expiries in 2026, the government price setting in 2026 and 2027 noted above, as well as ongoing competitive pressures, the Company anticipates significant sales declines for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR in the U.S. in 2026 and thereafter.\n\nThe Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in  all  of  the  EU and for Janumet in some European countries in September 2022. Exclusivity for Janumet was lost in other European countries in A pril 2023. A ccordingly , the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue.

      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead acknowledged that the composition of matter patent for Yescarta had expired in the European Union, and while U.S. patent term extension applications were pending to extend protection to at least 2028, the company emphasized pending patents for Kite\u2019s proprietary manufacturing processes. This shift indicates a strategic focus on process-related IP to maintain competitive advantage.

      "answer": "In 2022, MDT reported $125 million in mutual funds that were entirely measured using Level 1 inputs, indicating a full reliance on actively quoted market prices for valuation. By 2023, the fair value of mutual funds decreased to $106 million, still entirely measured using Level 1 inputs. This $19 million decline suggests a strategic reduction in mutual fund exposure, with the company likely reallocating capital toward other investment categories such as fixed income commingled trusts or partnership units, which saw increases in fair value. The continued use of Level 1 inputs for mutual funds shows MDT maintained a preference for highly liquid, transparently valued assets despite the portfolio size reduction.",

      "question": "How did Amgen's 2022 restructuring of its Aimovig collaboration with Novartis affect its competitive positioning against Novartis' Cosentyx in the psoriasis market by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen restructured its Aimovig collaboration with Novartis, ending their joint U.S. commercialization arrangement and royalty payments on U.S. sales, while retaining shared global R&D cost obligations. This restructuring removed a financial dependency on Novartis in the U.S. market. By 2024, Amgen\u2019s Otezla was directly competing with Novartis\u2019 Cosentyx in the psoriasis market across the U.S. and Europe, as shown in Amgen\u2019s competitive landscape table. While the filings do not explicitly state that the Aimovig restructuring was a strategic move to enable more aggressive competition with Novartis in other therapeutic areas like psoriasis, the removal of the U.S. royalty obligation to Novartis may have provided Amgen with greater flexibility in pricing, marketing, and positioning Otezla against Cosentyx, which is a leading biologic in the psoriasis space.",

          "chunk_text": "## Business Relationships\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we acquire product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&amp;D  capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product  base.  These arrangements  generally provide for nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees,  development  and  commercial-performance  milestone  payments,  cost  sharing,  royalty  payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\n\nTrade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we  generally  require  counterparties  to  execute  confidentiality  agreements  upon  commencement  of  a  business  relationship  with  us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in early 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash  and  development  services  of  up  to  $1.25  billion.  Upon  regulatory  approval,  BeiGene  will  assume  commercialization  rights  in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.\n\n## Novartis\n\nWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig. On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Part IVNote 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arrangement through December 31, 2021\n\nIn the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal,  recognized  product  sales  of  Aimovig  in  the  United  States,  shared  U.S.  commercialization  costs  with  Novartis  and  paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis held global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&amp;D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to  make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States.\n\n## Arrangement after January 1, 2022\n\nPursuant  to  the  amendment  effective  January  1,  2022,  Novartis  retains  the  ex-U.S.  Novartis  Rights  and  will  continue  to  pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig.

      "question": "How did LLY's 340B Program obligations affecting 23.1% of sales in 2023 influence its exposure to new federal regulatory developments in 2024, particularly regarding contract pharmacy policies and potential enforcement actions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, LLY was subject to the 340B Program, which required it to provide discounts to covered entities, impacting an increasing percentage of sales\u2014starting at a minimum of 23.1% plus adjustments for price increases. This growing exposure was compounded by regulatory uncertainty, as highlighted in Pfizer\u2019s 2023 filing, where HHS HRSA was actively enforcing 340B Program compliance, issuing letters to manufacturers over contract pharmacy policies and referring some for potential enforcement actions. By 2024, LLY explicitly listed 'regulatory changes and developments' and 'regulatory compliance problems or government investigations' as material risk factors, indicating that the company faced heightened exposure to federal scrutiny\u2014likely including 340B-related enforcement\u2014due to its expanding obligations under the program. This shows a clear 3-hop chain: LLY\u2019s 2023 340B obligations \u2192 increased regulatory focus on 340B compliance \u2192 LLY\u2019s 2024 exposure to new enforcement risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2023) \u2192 340B Program: LLY was subject to 340B Program requirements, impacting at least 23.1% of sales.",

        "Hop 3: New Regulations \u2190 LLY(2024): In 2024, LLY listed regulatory compliance issues and government investigations as key risk factors, indicating exposure to these new enforcement trends."

By 2024, China's evolving pharmaceutical regulatory environment, including market reforms aimed at accelerating access to innovative products while reducing costs, continued to pressure LLY\u2019s pricing and reimbursement strategies.

In 2019, we and Innovent began co-commercializing Tyvyt in China. In 2020, we obtained an exclusive license for sintilimab injection from Innovent for geographies outside of China. Innovent, with collaboration from us, has filed the initial registration of sintilimab injection in the U.S., and we plan to pursue initial registration of sintilimab injection in other markets and all other subsequent registrations of sintilimab injection. We have exclusive commercialization rights outside of China.\n\nIn connection with a regulatory approval for Tyvyt in China in 2021, we capitalized a milestone payment of $40.0 million as an intangible asset which is being amortized to cost of sales through the term of the collaboration.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Innovent is eligible to receive up to $825.0 million for geographies outside of China and up to $195.0 million in China in success-based regulatory and sales-based milestones. Innovent is also eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales for geographies outside of China.\n\nWe record our sales of Tyvyt to third parties as net product revenue, with payments made to Innovent for its portion of the gross margin reported as cost of sales. We report as collaboration and other revenue our portion of the gross margin for Tyvyt sales made by Innovent to third parties.

          "chunk_text": "## Outside the U.S.\n\nGlobally, public and priv ate payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparativ e effectiv eness and v alue, including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition, third-party organizations, including professional associations, academic institutions, and non-profit entities associated with payers, conduct and publish comparativ e effectiv eness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines, the impact of which can influence pharmaceutical access and pricing.\n\nIn most international markets, we operate in an env ironment of gov ernment-mandated cost-containment programs, which may include price controls, international reference pricing, discounts and rebates, therapeutic reference pricing (to other, often generic, pharmaceutical choices), health technology assessments, regulatory hurdles, restrictions on physician prescription lev els, and mandatory generic substitution. In these markets, healthcare serv ices and the determination of pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products are impacted by gov ernment control at the point of care or as the primary payer.\n\nThe European Commission published its draft General Pharmaceutical Legislation in April 2023. While certain elements in the European Commission draft could expedite regulatory timelines, we anticipate that the ov erall market and patient impact would be negativ e if the legislation is approv ed as drafted. Implementation timing is unknown at this time. Health care cost containment remains a focus in the EU, among other jurisdictions. Most countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in some form of reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined internal or external markets for published prices of a product or national class of drugs. Member states also hav e the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems prov ide reimbursement and may condition access on agreement of a reimbursement price or completion of cost-effectiv eness or other gating studies.\n\nIn Japan, our products can be subject to gov ernment-mandated annual price reductions. The gov ernment may also order re-pricings for specific products or classes of products if certain criteria are met, including exceeding product use thresholds.\n\nChina has introduced and implemented reforms to accelerate access to innov ativ e products and reduce costs. To driv e patient access, we seek inclusion of many of our branded products on China's National Reimbursement Drug List, a list of drugs fully or partially reimbursed by China's national basic health insurance. In exchange for broad access, these products are generally subject to negotiation of significant price concessions. China also utilizes a v alue-based procurement program process for products that hav e generic substitutes. As a general matter, products that we choose to tender through this process are similarly subject to price reductions. Our business in China may be significantly impacted by the country's ev olv ing pharmaceutical regulatory env ironment, including access, intellectual property protection, regulatory enforcement and compliance, and trade policies.\n\nGovernments in many emerging markets are also focused on limiting health care costs and hav e enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property. Reforms in our product markets, including those that may stem from periods of unev en economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation, emergence, or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or gov ernment budgeting priorities, may continue to result in added pressure on pricing, access, and reimbursement for our products.\n\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by current or potential future legislativ e, regulatory, or payer dev elopments. However, in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing, resulting in additional state, federal, and international legislativ e and regulatory dev elopments that could hav e further negativ e effects on pricing, access, and reimbursement for our products as well as ov erall operations.\n\nSee Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Executive Overv iew-Other Matters-Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Dev elopments,\" for additional information regarding recent legislativ e, administrativ e, and other pricing initiativ es and their impact on our results.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur commitment to research and dev elopment dates back nearly 150 years. We inv est heav ily in research and dev elopment because we believ e it is critical to our long-term competitiv eness. At the end of 2024, we employed approximately 11,000 people in pharmaceutical research and dev elopment activ ities, including a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel.",

      "question": "How did AbbVie's litigation strategy involving Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited in 2022 relate to the performance of Vraylar in 2023, particularly in terms of revenue growth and patent protection efforts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie, through its subsidiary Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited, was actively involved in litigation to enforce patent rights for Vraylar, specifically targeting companies attempting to market generic versions of the drug. This legal strategy aimed to protect Vraylar's market exclusivity. By 2023, Vraylar demonstrated strong revenue growth, increasing from $2,038 million in 2022 to $2,759 million in 2023, a 35.4% increase. The litigation efforts in 2022 likely contributed to maintaining Vraylar's market position by delaying generic competition, which in turn supported its revenue performance in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABBV(2022) \u2192 Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited: In 2022, AbbVie was actively enforcing patent rights for Vraylar through litigation led by its subsidiary Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited.",
        "Hop 2: Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited \u2192 Vraylar: Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited was directly involved in the legal defense of Vraylar's patents, indicating a strategic link between the subsidiary and the drug's market protection.",
        "Hop 3: Vraylar \u2190 ABBV(2023): In 2023, Vraylar's revenue increased significantly to $2,759 million, up from $2,038 million in 2022, suggesting that the earlier litigation efforts helped preserve its market position."

      "question": "How did the extension of regulatory exclusivity for Januvia and Janumet in the U.S. through May 2026 and July 2026 respectively, influenced by patent litigation outcomes in 2023, affect MRK's market exclusivity position and sales trajectory in 2024 compared to the expected exclusivity loss in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MRK was subject to standard regulatory exclusivity timelines, with the key U.S. patent for Januvia and Janumet expiring in January 2023. However, due to favorable court rulings and settlement agreements in 2023 regarding a later-expiring patent covering the sitagliptin salt form, MRK extended its market exclusivity in the U.S. until May 2026 for Januvia and Janumet, and July 2026 for Janumet XR. This regulatory exclusivity extension significantly delayed the expected loss of exclusivity, which in turn slowed the rate of sales erosion in 2024. Despite a 33% decline in combined sales of Januvia and Janumet in 2024 due to lower U.S. pricing and demand, the delay in exclusivity loss allowed MRK to maintain a stronger market position than would have been the case if exclusivity had ended in early 2023, as generic competition was postponed.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK(2022) \u2192 Regulatory Exclusivity: MRK was subject to standard regulatory exclusivity timelines, with the key U.S. patent for Januvia and Janumet set to expire in January 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Regulatory Exclusivity \u2192 Market Exclusivity: Regulatory exclusivity protections, particularly those tied to data and patent extensions, directly determine the period during which a company can maintain market exclusivity without generic competition.",
        "Hop 3: Market Exclusivity \u2190 MRK(2024): Due to litigation outcomes in 2023, MRK extended its market exclusivity in the U.S. until 2026, which slowed the rate of sales erosion in 2024 despite a 33% decline in Januvia and Janumet sales."

(1)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the patents in the above charts are compound patents. Each patent may be subject to a future patent term restoration of up to five years and six month pediatric market exclusivity, either or both of which may be available. In addition, depending on the circumstances surrounding any final regulatory approval of the compound, there may be other listed patents  or  patent  applications  pending  that  could  have  relevance  to  the  product  as  finally  approved;  the  relevance  of  any  such application would depend upon the claims that ultimately may be granted and the nature of the final regulatory approval of the product. Also, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data is complementary to patent protection and, in some cases, may provide more effective or longer lasting marketing exclusivity than a compound's patent estate. In the U.S., the data protection generally  runs  five  years  from  first  marketing  approval  of  a  new  chemical  entity,  extended  to  seven  years  for  an  orphan  drug indication and 12 years from first marketing approval of a biological product.\n\nWhile  the  expiration  of  a  compound  patent  normally  results  in  a  loss  of  market  exclusivity  for  the  covered pharmaceutical  product,  commercial  benefits  may  continue  to  be  derived  from:  (i)  later-expiring  patents  on  processes  and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii) patents relating to the  use  of  such  product;  (iii)  patents  relating  to  novel  compositions  and  formulations;  and  (iv)  in  the  U.S.  and  certain  other countries, market exclusivity that may be available under relevant law. The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the  market,  the  complexities  and  economics  of  the  process  for  manufacture  of  the  active  ingredient  of  the  product  and  the requirements  of  new  drug  provisions  of  the  Federal  Food,  Drug  and  Cosmetic  Act  or  similar  laws  and  regulations  in  other countries.\n\nAdditions to  market  exclusivity  are  sought  in  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  through  all  relevant  laws,  including  laws increasing patent life. Some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by an increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products. Additionally, improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the U.S. and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties.\n\nFor  further  information  with  respect  to  the  Company's  patents,  see  Item  1A.  'Risk  Factors'  and  Item  8.  'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' Note 11. 'Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities' below.\n\nWorldwide, all of the Company's important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be  of  material  importance.

We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn  the  pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. A product's market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes provided by regulatory exclusivity, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic or biosimilar copy. Regulatory exclusivity can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.\n\nWhen these patent rights and other forms of exclusivity expire and generic versions of a medicine are approved and marketed, there are often substantial and rapid declines in the sales of the original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic medicines on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific  aspects  of  the  law  governing  market  patent  protection  and  regulatory  ex clusivity  for  pharmaceuticals  vary  from  country  to  country.  The  following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovator company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, apply to the government to restore lost patent term by extending the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the  U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical product, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity as discussed below. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic ex clusivity.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor  seeking  to  launch  a  generic  substitute  of  a  chemical  innovative  drug  in  the  U.S.  must  file  an ANDA  with  the  FDA.  In  the ANDA,  the  generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWorldwide combined sales of Januvia and Janumet , medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, declined 33% in 2024 primarily due to lower sales in the U.S., largely reflecting lower pricing and lower demand due to competitive pressures, as well as the ongoing impact of the loss of exclusivity in most markets in Europe, the A sia Pacific region, and in Canada.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan A ct enacted in the U.S. in 2021 included a provision that eliminated the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. A s a result of this provision, the Company paid state M edicaid programs more in rebates than it received on M edicaid sales of Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR in 2024.\n\nIn early 2025, M erck lowered the list price of the Januvia family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount M erck pays to M edicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing, which will be partially offset by continuing volume declines. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products in 2025 compared with 2024.\n\nWhile the key U.S. patent for Januvia , Janumet and Janumet XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see  Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that Januvia and Janumet will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until M ay  2026 and Janumet XR will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company's sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA . A dditionally , i n 2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Januvia would be included in the first y ear of the IRA 's Program. Pursuant to the IRA 's Program, a government price was set for Januvia , which will become effective on January 1, 2026. A lso, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CM S, announced that Janumet and Janumet XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA 's Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA 's Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). A s a result of the anticipated patent expiries in 2026, the government price setting in 2026 and 2027 noted above, as well as ongoing competitive pressures, the Company anticipates significant sales declines for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR in the U.S. in 2026 and thereafter.\n\nThe Company lost market exclusivity for Januvia in  all  of  the  EU and for Janumet in some European countries in September 2022. Exclusivity for Janumet was lost in other European countries in A pril 2023. A ccordingly , the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue. Generic equivalents of Januvi a and Janumet have also launched in China.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen listed Otezla as competing against Novartis' Cosentyx in the U.S. and Europe, indicating a direct rivalry in the dermatology and immunology therapeutic areas. Cosentyx, being a product of Novartis, was a key competitor to Amgen's Otezla, highlighting a competitive tension between the two companies. However, by 2023, Amgen's 10-K filing referenced Novartis as a named partner, signaling a strategic pivot from competition to collaboration. This shift suggests that Amgen may have pursued a partnership strategy to access new capabilities, expand therapeutic pipelines, or leverage Novartis' strengths in areas where competition previously existed.",

          "chunk_text": "Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product, which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However, in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:\n\n- Regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period of data package protection depends on the country. For example, the period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics as described below), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent.\n- Under the BPCIA, the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, subject to certain conditions.\n- In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusivity\" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data protection and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant patents, to the extent these protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity attaches to the term of any relevant patent, pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity-i.e., a bar to generic or biosimilar approval, not a patent right.\n- Under the U.S. orphan drug law, a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive \"orphan\" designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits, orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric exclusivity, the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents.\n\nOutside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely, and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization, more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of \"flexibilities\" allowed under the agreement. Thus, some types of patents, such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules, are not available in certain developing countries. Further, many developing countries, and some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in TRIPs.\n\n## Our Intellectual Property Portfolio\n\nWe consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations-particularly with respect to those products discussed below-to be important to our operations. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold patents on manufacturing processes, formulations, devices, or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below. For approved products, dates include, where applicable, pending or granted patent term extensions.",

We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn  the  pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. A product's market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes provided by regulatory exclusivity, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic or biosimilar copy. Regulatory exclusivity can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.\n\nWhen these patent rights and other forms of exclusivity expire and generic versions of a medicine are approved and marketed, there are often substantial and rapid declines in the sales of the original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic medicines on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific  aspects  of  the  law  governing  market  patent  protection  and  regulatory  ex clusivity  for  pharmaceuticals  vary  from  country  to  country.  The  following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovator company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, apply to the government to restore lost patent term by extending the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the  U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical product, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity as discussed below. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic ex clusivity.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor  seeking  to  launch  a  generic  substitute  of  a  chemical  innovative  drug  in  the  U.S.  must  file  an ANDA  with  the  FDA.  In  the ANDA,  the  generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.",

          "chunk_text": "Moreover, the negotiating power of health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation, regulatory, and other market impacts, and they, along with gov ernments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion, or fav orable formulary placement. Such stakeholders hav e also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to limit access to our products. As these practices expand, including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. priv ate third-party payers, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitiv e and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\nPharmacy benefit manager practices hav e come under increased scrutiny from U.S. policymakers at the federal and state lev el who hav e proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact that these intermediaries hav e on drug pricing and patients' out of pocket costs. If promulgated, such legislation could hav e resultant implications, costs, or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see Item 1, \"Business-U.S. Priv ate Sector Dynamics\" and \"Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access-U.S.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\n- We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted, and in the future is likely to continue to result, in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products.\n\nIn the ordinary course of their lifecycles, our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S., as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S., after a specified period of time. For example, Trulicity will lose significant patent and remaining data protections in the next few years. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We hav e faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection.\n\nFor non-biologic products, loss of exclusiv ity typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and sev ere decline in rev enues, especially in the U.S. Generic pharmaceutical companies hav e in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation. For biologics, loss of exclusiv ity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor v ersions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including dev elopment timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approv al pathways.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often inv olv e complex legal, scientific and factual questions. There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found v alid and enforceable if challenged. Third parties may challenge, inv alidate, or circumv ent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not be deemed to infringe our patents. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes may not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternativ e processes or marketing alternativ e products or formulations that compete with our patented products. Patents held by third-parties hav e also contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all potential indications for a product candidate. In addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activ ities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property.

Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\n\n## IPR&amp;D\n\nIPR&amp;D assets represent R&amp;D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

      "question": "How did the increase in available shares under the Amended 2009 Plan from 12 million in 2023 to 59 million in 2024 influence AMGN's future grant capacity and equity compensation strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Amended 2009 Plan provided for future grants and/or issuances of up to approximately 12 million shares. By 2024, this number had increased significantly to approximately 59 million shares. This increase suggests that AMGN's future grant capacity expanded considerably, likely due to the return of forfeited or canceled awards into the authorized pool under the plan\u2019s rules. The larger pool of available shares in 2024 likely enabled a more aggressive equity compensation strategy, including the issuance of RSUs, stock options, and performance units, which are key tools for attracting and retaining talent. The plan\u2019s fungible share-counting formula\u2014where full-value awards such as RSUs consume 1.9 shares from the pool\u2014also played a role in shaping how these shares were allocated and managed.",

Stock-based compensation\n\nOur Amended 2009 Plan authorizes for issuance to employees of Amgen and nonemployee members of our Board of Directors shares of our common stock pursuant to grants of equity-based awards, including RSUs, stock options and performance units. The pool of shares available under the Amended 2009 Plan is reduced by one share for each stock option granted and by 1.9 shares for other types of awards granted, including full-value awards. In general, if any shares subject to an award granted under the Amended 2009 Plan expire or become forfeited, terminated or canceled without the issuance of shares, the shares subject to such awards are added back into the authorized pool on the same basis that they were removed. In addition, under the Amended 2009 Plan, shares withheld to pay for minimum statutory tax obligations with respect to full-value awards are added back into the authorized pool on the basis of 1.9 shares. As of December 31, 2024, the Amended 2009 Plan provides for future grants and/or issuances of up to approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. Stock-based awards under our employee compensation plans are made with newly issued shares reserved for this purpose.\n\nThe following table reflects the components of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Amended 2009 Plan employs a fungible share-counting formula for determining the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each RSU, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share-counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance  units  granted  represent  target  performance,  and  the  max imum  number  of  units  that  could  be  earned  based  on  our  performance  is  200%  of  the performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024. (1)\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes (i) 5,909,018 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $225.84; (ii) 3,289,089 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs, including 198,925 related dividend equivalents; and (iii) 1,516,669 shares subject to outstanding 2022, 2023 and 2024 performance units, including 91,901 related dividend equivalents. The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2024, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares  that  could  be  issuable  in  the  event  that  above  target  performance  on  the  performance  goals  under  these  outstanding  performance  units  is  achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\nThis plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 100 shares issuable upon the settlement of deferred RSUs.

      "answer": "In 2023, GILD was evaluating the combination of domvanalimab and zimberelimab as a first-line treatment for NSCLC in collaboration with Arcus Biosciences, but in January 2024, enrollment in the study was discontinued. Despite this setback, GILD maintained a strong commitment to zimberelimab, as evidenced in the 2024 patent portfolio, where zimberelimab was granted U.S. and EU patent protections extending to 2036. This suggests that GILD shifted strategic focus from combination trials to standalone intellectual property positioning for zimberelimab.",

        "Hop 1: GILD(2023) \u2192 Domvanalimab: In 2023, GILD was conducting a Phase 3 trial combining domvanalimab and zimberelimab for first-line NSCLC treatment, in collaboration with Arcus Biosciences.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of BMY's partnership with Ono from 2022 to 2024 influence the development and regulatory trajectory of Opdivo, particularly in light of increasing biosimilar competition risks identified in 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY identified Opdivo as a key biologic product facing heightened risk from biosimilar competition due to evolving regulatory frameworks in both the U.S. and EU, which could shorten market exclusivity periods. During that year, Ono, as BMY's alliance partner in Japan, played a critical role in expanding Opdivo's indications, including approvals for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma and combination therapies for RCC. By 2024, BMY had deepened its collaboration with Ono, explicitly listing multiple Opdivo-based regimens (e.g., OPDIVO, OPDUALAG, nivolumab + relatlimab HD) under its development partnerships, signaling a strategic shift toward combination therapies and broader oncology pipeline development. This evolution suggests that BMY leveraged its partnership with Ono to strengthen Opdivo\u2019s lifecycle management in response to the biosimilar threats outlined in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "answer": "Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty-related manufacturing fees from BioNTech dropped significantly from $188 million in 2022 to $33 million in 2023, indicating a reduced reliance on this revenue stream. However, in 2024, Comirnaty became the subject of multiple patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. and Europe, which could restrict its continued manufacture and sale. These legal actions pose new risks that may further impact Pfizer\u2019s ability to generate stable revenue from Comirnaty, especially in key markets like the U.S., France, Germany, and Sweden. Given the declining manufacturing fees and the new litigation risks, the combination could place significant downward pressure on future Comirnaty-related revenue unless resolved favorably.",

          "chunk_text": "The IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of inflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for M edicare Part B drugs. Separate IRA  provisions redesign the M edicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater portion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA  provisions may subject manufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties.\n\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and M edicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the IRA 's M edicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen's rights under the First A mendment and the Fifth A mendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA 's mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and while CM S has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs, implementation of the program is still in progress. In A pril 2024, Janssen appealed the district court's denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\n\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies, and other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to increase pricing transparency and controls.\n\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and M edicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. The IRA  and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products.\n\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied on companies for data breaches, violations of priv acy  requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant settlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use and disclosure of personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.\n\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.",

In the U.S., these include (i) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and M edicaid, including the M edicare Prescription Drug Improvement and M odernization A ct of 2003, the A CA , and the IRA , (ii) practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (iii) state activities aimed at increasing price transparency , including new laws as noted above in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment.' Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the U.S., as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of M edicare, M edicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. A s noted in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment,' in 2023, HHS selected Januvia for the first y ear of the IRA 's price setting program, which will result in a government set price becoming effective on January 1, 2026. Government price setting may also impact pricing in the private market, negatively affecting the Company's performance. In January 2025, HHS announced that Janumet and Janumet XR have been selected for government price setting, which will become effectiv e on January 1, 2027. Furthermore, the Company expects that in 2026 HHS will include Keytruda in a subsequent selection of products to undergo IRA price setting, with such price to become effective on January 1, 2028 and the Company expects that, as a result, U.S. sales of Keytruda will decline after that time. In addition, in the U.S., larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories. The Company must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization. The Company is also facing pricing pressure from purchasers of certain vaccines in highly competitive categories.\n\nOutside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, Japan and China have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix  the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Consequently , in those markets, the Company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the Japanese government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules.\n\nThe Company expects pricing pressures to continue in the future.\n\n## Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions, together with cost-reduction measures being taken by certain governments, could negatively affect the Company's operating results.\n\nThe Company's business may be adversely affected by local and global economic conditions, including with respect to inflation, interest rates, and costs of raw materials and packaging. Uncertainty in global economic and geopolitical conditions may result in a slowdown to the global economy that could affect the Company's business by reducing the prices that drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers may be able or willing to pay for the Company's products or by reducing the demand for the Company's products, which could in turn negatively impact the Company's sales and result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDT reported $1,069 million in fair value for fixed income commingled trusts, which decreased to $968 million in 2023, a decline of $101 million. This reduction contributed to a broader trend where total investments measured at net asset value fell from $2,350 million in 2022 to $2,179 million in 2023, a decrease of $171 million. The drop in fixed income commingled trusts was a significant component of this overall decline, reflecting a strategic shift or market-driven revaluation in MDT's investment portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MRK experienced a substantial decline in Bridion sales in the EU after losing market exclusivity, with further expected declines in Japan and the U.S. in subsequent years. This loss of exclusivity for key products like Bridion placed significant pressure on MRK's revenue. In 2024, Lynparza's alliance revenue grew by 9%, driven by higher demand in most international markets, partially mitigating the revenue impact from expiring exclusivity on other products. Additionally, Lynparza received a new approval in China in January 2025 for early breast cancer treatment, expanding its market potential and supporting MRK's strategic response to offset revenue losses from patent expirations.",

Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, M erck paid a royalty of 6.5% on worldwide sales of Keytruda through December 2023 to one third party; this royalty declined to 2.5% in 2024 and will continue through 2026 terminating thereafter. The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of Keytruda to another third party , the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty expired in the U.S. in September 2024 and will expire on varying dates in major European markets in the second half of 2025. The royalty expenses are included in Cost of sales .\n\nLynparza is an oral poly (A DP-ribose) polymerase (PA RP) inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with A straZeneca (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lynparza is approved for the treatment of certain types of advanced or recurrent ovarian, early or metastatic breast, metastatic pancreatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers. A lliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 9% in 2024 largely due to higher demand in most international markets. In January 2025, China's NM PA  approved Lynparza as adjuvant treatment for adult patients with germline BRCA -mutated, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer, based on the OlympiA  trial.\n\nLenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, RCC, HCC, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with advanced RCC, and in combination with Keytruda for certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. A lliance revenue related to Lenvima grew 5% in 2024 primarily reflecting higher demand and pricing in the U.S.\n\nSales  of Welireg , for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors and certain adult patients with previously treated advanced RCC, more than doubled in 2024 primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. reflecting in part continued uptake of the RCC indication following approval by the FDA  in December 2023. In November 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain V HL disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery based on the LITESPARK-004 clinical trial. In February 2025, the EC conditionally approved Welireg as monotherapy both for the treatment of adult patients with V HL disease who require therapy for associated, localized RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and for whom localized procedures are unsuitable, and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced clear cell RCC that progressed following two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and at least two V EGF targeted therapies. The EC approval of these two indications is based on results from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 trials. The conditional approval of Welireg will be v alid for one y ear, subject to y early  renewal, pending certain additional clinical data. Timing for commercial availability of Welireg in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures.\n\nReblozyl is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Reblozyl is approved for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders. A lliance revenue related to this collaboration (consisting of royalties) increased 75% in 2024 due to strong underlying sales performance.\n\n## Vaccines\n\n",

      "question": "How did the changes in BMY's exposure to market exclusivity risks in 2023 influence the company's reliance on regulatory exclusivity protections for biologic products like Opdivo and Abecma in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BMY expressed significant concern about the unpredictability of maintaining full market exclusivity for its products, citing risks such as potential government use of march-in rights, generic competition, and weaker patent protections in certain international markets. These risks were tied directly to the uncertainty around how long products like Opdivo and Abecma would enjoy exclusivity, which in turn affected financial guidance. In 2024, the company emphasized its reliance on regulatory exclusivity as a key mechanism to protect biologic products, noting that U.S. law provides 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for such products, including Opdivo, Abecma, and others. This shift shows that as market exclusivity risks increased in 2023, BMY placed greater strategic importance on leveraging regulatory exclusivity frameworks in 2024 to maintain competitive advantage and revenue stability for its biologic portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BMY(2023) \u2192 Market Exclusivity: BMY expressed uncertainty about maintaining full market exclusivity for its products and the potential impact on financial guidance due to risks like march-in rights and generic competition.",
        "Hop 2: Market Exclusivity \u2192 Regulatory Exclusivity: Market exclusivity is partially determined by regulatory exclusivity, which provides a period during which regulators cannot approve generic or biosimilar versions based on the innovator's data.",
        "Hop 3: Regulatory Exclusivity \u2190 BMY(2024): BMY noted that biologic products like Opdivo and Abecma are protected by 12 years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., which became a more critical asset as market exclusivity risks grew."

          "chunk_text": "Abraxane Abraxane (paclitax el albumin-bound particles for injectable suspension) is a solvent-free protein-bound chemotherapy product that combines paclitaxel with  albumin  using  our  proprietary Nab technology platform, and is used to treat breast cancer,  NSCLC and pancreatic cancer, among others. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries primarily covering our products. We have also developed many brand names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.\n\nIn  the  pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. A product's market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.\n\nPatents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.\n\nMarket exclusivity is also sometimes provided by regulatory exclusivity, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic or biosimilar copy. Regulatory exclusivity can provide a market exclusivity period on a product that expires beyond the patent term.\n\nWhen these patent rights and other forms of exclusivity expire and generic versions of a medicine are approved and marketed, there are often substantial and rapid declines in the sales of the original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic medicines on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific  aspects  of  the  law  governing  market  patent  protection  and  regulatory  ex clusivity  for  pharmaceuticals  vary  from  country  to  country.  The  following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovator company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, apply to the government to restore lost patent term by extending the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the  U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical product, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity as discussed below. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic ex clusivity.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor  seeking  to  launch  a  generic  substitute  of  a  chemical  innovative  drug  in  the  U.S.  must  file  an ANDA  with  the  FDA.  In  the ANDA,  the  generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.",

          "chunk_text": "An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovator's NDA is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the generic product. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV  certification. The innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, ANDAs including Paragraph IV  certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these ANDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines can also receive several types of regulatory exclusivity. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, a generic manufacturer may file its ANDA after the fourth year  of  the  five-year  regulatory  ex clusivity  period.  Our  marketed  chemical  products  include Eliquis,  Revlimid,  Pomalyst,  Sprycel,  Zeposia,  Camzyos,  Sotyktu , Augtyro, Krazati, and Cobenfy .\n\n## Biologic products (includes CAR-T cell therapy products)\n\nQualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative  biological  product  was  first  approved  by  the  FDA.  Our  marketed  biologic  products  include Opdivo , Opdivo  Qvantig, Orencia, Yervoy,  Reblozyl, Opdualag, Breyanzi, Abecma and Abraxane.\n\nIn the U.S., medicines (chemically synthesized or biologically derived) may also receive an additional six months of market exclusivity (added to certain patent terms and regulatory exclusivities) if certain agreed-upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market ex clusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions may limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory ex clusivity.\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended for up to five years to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 15 years from the date of drug approval. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis. The EU provides an additional six months of exclusivity added to the extended patent term if certain pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized  procedure.'  This  procedure  is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA.\n\nAfter obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout  the  EU,  all  products  for  which  marketing  authorizations  have  been  filed  after  October  and  November  2005  are  subject  to  an  '8+2+1'  regulatory exclusivity regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with ex isting treatments.",

      "answer": "The significant rise in intercompany payables tied to CIFSA Senior Notes indicates a deepening financial entanglement between CIFSA and the broader Medtronic group, particularly under the guarantee framework involving Medtronic plc, Medtronic Luxco, and other subsidiary guarantors. This suggests that Medtronic may have increased its internal financing support for CIFSA, potentially to strengthen liquidity positioning or consolidate debt obligations under a more unified guarantee structure. The doubling of payables from 2022 to 2024 aligns with the consistent inclusion of CIFSA within the broader Medtronic Senior Notes guarantee chain, implying a strategic shift toward reinforcing CIFSA\u2019s financial standing through intercompany mechanisms.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen highlighted regulatory risks around patent protection and exclusivity periods for its biologics, noting that changes in policies like the removal of 10-year data exclusivity in the USMCA and potential limitations on 'umbrella exclusivity' could expose products like Prolia/XGEVA to biosimilar competition earlier than expected. By 2024, the patent expiration table showed that Prolia/XGEVA's European patent expired in June 2022, while its U.S. patent remains protected until February 2025. This timeline indicates that Amgen faced biosimilar entry in Europe in 2022, while maintaining exclusivity in the U.S. through early 2025, allowing for continued revenue generation in the U.S. market.

          "chunk_text": "products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  a  requirement  for  at  least  10  years  of  data  exclusivity  for  biologic  products.  Also,  the  FDA  is  considering  whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as 'umbrella exclusivity'). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does  not  apply  to  biological  reference  products  or  were  to  make  other  changes  to  the  exclusivity  period,  this  could  expose  us  to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition  through  policies  enabling  easier  generic  and  biosimilar  approval  and  commercialization,  including  efforts  to  lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential  reimbursement  policies  for  biosimilars  and  pass  new  laws  requiring  more  disclosure  in  the  FDA's  Orange  and  Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered  training  to  help  identify  prior  art,  and  seeking  USPTO's  views  on  practices  that  extend  market  exclusivities,  whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the PTAB on drug patents.\n\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents and unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product by an additional six months.\n\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first  state  to  have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against 'pay for delay' settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement  agreements  are  presumptively  anticompetitive.  The  law  may  result  in  prolonged  litigation  and  fewer  settlements.  Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.\n\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three  pharmaceutical  product  wholesaler  distributors:  McKesson  Corporation, AmerisourceBergen  Corporation  and  Cardinal  Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis  facilities  located  in  the  United  States  and  accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  all  EPOGEN sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs  now  oversee  a  substantial  percentage  of  total  covered  lives  in  the  United  States.  See Our  sales  depend  on  coverage  and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely  to  continue  to  affect,  our  profitability. The  three  largest  PBMs  in  the  United  States  are  now  part  of  major  health  insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing  volume.  Further,  if  one  of  our  significant  wholesale  distributors  encounters  financial  or  other  difficulties  and  becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&amp;D.\n\nAmgen invests heavily in R&amp;D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&amp;D projects yield approved and commercially viable products.

Under our collaboration, UCB has rights to lead commercialization for EVENITY in most countries in Europe. Amgen, as the principal, leads commercialization for EVENITY  and recognizes product sales in all other territories, including the United States. G lobal development costs and commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration are shared equally. Amgen manufactures and supplies EVENITY worldwide.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, global profit and loss share expenses were $547 million, $396 million and $255 million, respectively, and were recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net costs recovered from and due to UCB during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were not material.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nIn January 2020, we acquired an equity stake in BeiG ene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. For  additional  information  regarding  our  equity  investment  in  BeiG ene,  see  Note  10,  Investments.  Under  the  collaboration,  BeiG ene  began  selling  XG EV A  in  2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen would pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China of such products for a specified period. Amgen manufactures and supplies the collaboration products to BeiGene.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiG ene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash and development services of up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiG ene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiG ene will share profits and losses equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiG ene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen also pays royalties to BeiGene.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net costs recovered from BeiG ene for oncology product candidates were $122 million, $109 million and $199 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, product sales from Amgen to BeiG ene under the collaboration were $259 million, $125 million and $64 million, respectively, and were recorded in Product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Profit and loss share expenses related to the initial product-specific commercialization period were not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.\n\nWe are in a collaboration and licensing agreement with Kyowa Kirin to jointly develop and commercialize rocatinlimab, an anti-OX40 fully human monoclonal antibody, worldwide, except in Japan. Rocatinlimab is for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, with potential for treatment of other autoimmune diseases.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we lead the global development, manufacture and commercialization of rocatinlimab, except in Japan. Kyowa Kirin will co-promote rocatinlimab with Amgen in the United States and have opt in rights to co-promote rocatinlimab in various other markets outside the United States, including in Europe and Asia.\n\nWe made an upfront payment of $400 million to Kyowa Kirin that was recognized in R&amp;D expense in the third quarter of 2021. Amgen and Kyowa Kirin share equally the global development costs, except in Japan, and the U.S. commercialization costs. Outside the United States and Japan, any commercialization costs incurred by Kyowa Kirin will be reimbursed by Amgen. We may also be required to make milestone payments of up to $850 million contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory events and commercial thresholds. We will also pay Kyowa Kirin significant double-digit royalties on global sales, except in Japan. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net costs recovered from Kyowa Kirin were $166 million, $93 million and $23 million, respectively, and were recorded as an offset to R&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Other\n\nIn addition to the collaborations discussed above, we have various other collaborations that are not individually significant to our business at this time. Pursuant to the terms of those agreements, we may be required to pay additional amounts, or we may receive additional amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones that in the aggregate could be significant. We may also incur or have reimbursed to us significant R&amp;D costs if a related product candidate were to advance to late-stage clinical trials. In addition, if any products related to these collaborations are approved for sale, we may be required to pay significant royalties, or we may receive significant royalties on future sales. The payments of these amounts, however, are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events that have high degrees of uncertainty of occurrence.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of BMY's royalty and co-promotion relationship with Ono from 2022 to 2024 impact the global revenue growth trajectory of Orencia, particularly in light of the 60% co-promotion fee structure and the product's $3,682 million revenue in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY's relationship with Ono centered around royalty agreements for Opdivo, with BMY paying Ono 15% royalties outside of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. By 2024, the relationship had expanded to include joint development and commercialization of Orencia in Japan, with a structured 60% co-promotion fee when one party sells to the other's assigned customer. Orencia reached $3,682 million in global revenue in 2024, up from undisclosed levels in 2022, indicating that the deepened collaboration with Ono contributed to its growth trajectory. The co-promotion model, with BMY handling the intravenous formulation and Ono the subcutaneous version, likely enhanced market penetration and revenue generation in key territories.",

          "chunk_text": "\nBMS is the principal in the end customer product sales and has the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize Opdivo worldwide except in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Ono is entitled to receive royalties of 4% in North America and 15% in all territories excluding the three countries listed above, subject to customary adjustments.\n\n## Nektar\n\nIn  2018,  BMS  and  Nektar  commenced  a  worldwide  license  and  collaboration  for  the  development  and  commercialization  of Bempegaldesleukin  (NKTR-214),  Nektar's  investigational  immuno-stimulatory  therapy  designed  to  selectively  expand  specific cancer-fighting T cells and natural killer cells directly in the tumor micro-environment. In January 2020, the parties amended the collaboration agreement. The Opdivo and NKTR-214 combination therapy is currently in Phase III clinical studies for metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and RCC. A joint development plan agreed by the parties as part of the original agreement, and updated as part of the January 2020 amendment, specifies development in certain indications and tumor types  with  each  party  responsible  for  the  supply  of  their  own  product.  BMS's  share  of  the  development  costs  associated  with therapies comprising a BMS medicine used in combination with NKTR-214 is 67.5%, subject to certain cost caps for Nektar. The January  2020  amendment  retains  the  cost  sharing  percentages  from  the  original  agreement.  The  parties  will  also  jointly commercialize  the  therapies,  subject  to  regulatory  approval.  BMS's  share  of  global  NKTR-214  profits  and  losses  will  be  35% subject to certain annual loss caps for Nektar.\n\nBMS paid Nektar $1.85 billion for the rights discussed above and 8.3 million shares of Nektar common stock which represented a 4.8% ownership interest.  BMS's equity  ownership  is  subject  to  certain  lock-up,  standstill  and  voting  provisions  for  a  five-year period. The amount of the up-front payment allocated to the equity investment was $800 million after considering Nektar's stock price on the date of closing and current limitations on trading the securities. The remaining $1.05 billion of the up-front payment was allocated to the rights discussed above. BMS will also pay up to $1.8 billion upon the achievement of contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones over the life of the alliance period. Research and development cost reimbursements were $98 million in 2021, $132 million in 2020 and $108 million in 2019.\n\n## 2seventy bio (formerly bluebird)\n\nOn November 4, 2021, bluebird completed the tax-free spin-off of its oncology programs and portfolio into 2seventy bio, Inc., an independent, publicly-traded company.\n\nThe  parties  jointly  develop  and  commercialize  novel  disease-altering  gene  therapy  product  candidates  targeting  BCMA.  The collaboration arrangement began in 2013 and included (i) a right for BMS to license any anti-BCMA products resulting from the collaboration,  (ii)  a  right  for  2seventy  bio  to  participate  in  the  development  and  commercialization  of  any  licensed  products resulting  from  the  collaboration  through  a  50/50  co-development  and  profit  share  in  the  U.S.  in  exchange  for  a  reduction  of milestone  payments,  and  (iii)  sales-based  milestones  and  royalties  payable  to  2seventy  bio  upon  the  commercialization  of  any licensed  products  resulting  from  the  collaboration  if  2seventy  bio  declined  to  exercise  their  co-development  and  profit  sharing rights. The options to license idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121) and bb21217 were exercised in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2022, the parties elected to not pursue further development of bb21217.\n\nAll profits and losses relating to developing, commercializing and manufacturing ide-cel within the U.S. are shared equally. BMS is exclusively responsible for the development and commercialization of ide-cel outside the U.S.\n\nIn  2020,  terms  of  the  collaboration  were  amended  including  certain  manufacturing  obligations.  Both  parties  were  also  released from future exclusivity related to BCMA-directed T cell therapies. BMS paid $200 million to extinguish its obligation for future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on ide-cel, which was included in Research and development expense in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the FDA approved ide-cel (' Abecma ' ) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Net product sales of Abecma  within  the  Alliance  territory  were  $158  million  and  related  profit  sharing  costs  were  $42  million  in  2021.  Cost reimbursements were not material.",

      "answer": "In 2023, BMY and Ono shared Keytruda royalty payments from Merck at a 75/25 split based on a 6.5% global royalty rate. Starting in 2024, this royalty rate dropped to 2.5%, significantly reducing the revenue stream both parties received from Keytruda. Despite this decline, BMY continued its collaboration with Ono in immuno-oncology programs such as OPDIVO and YERVOY, indicating that the strategic partnership remained intact despite the financial shift. This suggests that while the financial dynamics were impacted by the royalty rate reduction, the operational and developmental partnership persisted into 2024.",

      "question": "How did Medtronic's guarantee obligations for the CIFSA Senior Notes in FY2022 relate to its stake in Covidien Group Holdings Ltd. in FY2023, particularly in terms of financial liability structure and subsidiary interconnectivity?",
      "answer": "In FY2022, Medtronic plc and its subsidiary Medtronic Luxco provided full and unconditional guarantees for the CIFSA Senior Notes, alongside other subsidiary guarantors including Covidien Group Holdings Ltd. and Covidien Ltd. This formed a multi-layered liability structure where multiple subsidiaries were legally bound to CIFSA\u2019s obligations. By FY2023, Medtronic maintained its stake in Covidien Group Holdings Ltd., which remained a subsidiary guarantor of the CIFSA Senior Notes. This continuity indicates that Medtronic preserved its indirect financial exposure through subsidiary interconnectivity, ensuring that its stake in Covidien Group Holdings Ltd. continued to serve as a legal backstop for CIFSA\u2019s debt obligations. The structure remained stable across both years, with no indication of reduced liability burden or restructuring of these guarantees.",

This collaboration included a co-promotion fee structure of 60% when sales were made to the other party's assigned customers. By 2024, BMY deepened its strategic alignment with Ono, as evidenced by the inclusion of multiple Ono-partnered programs (OPDIVO, YERVOY, OPDUALAG, nivolumab + relatlimab HD, Anti-CCR8 + nivolumab) in BMY\u2019s development pipeline, indicating a broader expansion of their partnership beyond Orencia into other key therapeutic areas.

      "answer": "In 2023, Eliquis was highlighted as BMY\u2019s top-selling product and a key growth driver, with no explicit mention of the financial structure of its partnership with Pfizer. By 2024, BMY disclosed that the upfront payment and potential milestone payments from Pfizer were recorded under Deferred income and are being amortized over the expected period of BMY\u2019s co-promotion obligation through the market exclusivity period. Additionally, in smaller markets, Pfizer has full commercialization rights, and BMY supplies the product at cost plus a percentage of net sales, which is recorded in full upon transfer of control. This reveals a more detailed financial arrangement in 2024 that wasn\u2019t specified in 2023, showing how BMY\u2019s revenue recognition strategy evolved for this partnership.",

      "question": "How did the loss of market exclusivity for Bridion in the EU in 2023 impact MRK's overall dependence on its key products, particularly in light of the anticipated U.S. exclusivity loss in 2026?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MRK's financial performance was heavily dependent on key products such as Bridion, which contributed significantly to profits and cash flows. In 2023, Bridion lost market exclusivity in the EU, leading to a substantial decline in sales in those markets. This decline highlights the vulnerability of MRK's business model, which continues to rely heavily on key products like Keytruda and Gardasil/Gardasil 9, which together accounted for 56% of total sales in 2023. With Bridion's U.S. exclusivity set to expire in 2026, MRK faces further revenue erosion unless it successfully replaces lost sales with new product launches or expanded indications for existing drugs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK(2022) \u2192 Bridion: MRK's profitability was significantly tied to Bridion and other key products in 2022, with anticipated revenue declines upon loss of exclusivity.",
        "Hop 2: Bridion \u2192 Key Products: Bridion is explicitly listed as one of MRK's key products, and its loss of exclusivity in the EU in 2023 led to a material decline in sales.",
        "Hop 3: Key Products \u2190 MRK(2023): In 2023, MRK's revenue remains highly concentrated in key products, with Keytruda and Gardasil/Gardasil 9 representing 56% of total sales, increasing the impact of Bridion's decline."

In the case of products that contribute significantly to the Company's sales, the loss of market exclusivity can have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Januvia and Janumet will lose market exclusivity in the U.S. in January 2023. Januvia and Janumet will  lose  market exclusivity in the EU in September 2022 and in China in July 2022.  The  Company  anticipates  sales  of Januvia and Janumet in  these  markets  will  decline  substantially  after  the  loss  of exclusivity.\n\n## Key  products  generate  a  significant  amount  of  the  Company's  profits  and  cash  flows,  and  any  events  that adversely  affect  the  markets  for  its  leading  products  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  results  of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of the Company's key products, such as Keytruda, Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Lynparza, Bravecto , and Bridion . In particular, in 2021, the Company's oncology portfolio, led by Keytruda, represented a substantial portion of the Company's revenue growth. As a result of the Company's dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and financial condition. These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the Company's product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the sales of any such products.\n\nThe  Company's  research  and  development  efforts  may  not  succeed  in  developing  commercially  successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in other ways; in consequence, the Company may not be able to replace sales of successful products that lose patent protection.\n\nIn order to remain competitive, the Company, like other major pharmaceutical companies, must continue to launch new products. Expected declines in sales of products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the Company's future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products that it may develop through collaborations and joint ventures and products that it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. To accomplish this, the Company commits substantial effort, funds  and  other  resources  to  research  and  development,  both  through  its  own  dedicated  resources  and  through  various collaborations with third parties. There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs and vaccines. As a result,  there  is  a  high  risk  that  funds  invested  by  the  Company  in  research  programs  will  not  generate  financial returns.  This  risk  profile  is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  this  research  has  a  long  investment  cycle.  To  bring  a  pharmaceutical compound from  the  discovery  phase  to  market  may  take  a  decade  or  more  and  failure  can  occur  at  any  point  in  the  process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested.\n\nFor a description of the research and development process, see Item 1. 'Business - Research and Development' above. Each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals. Therefore, the Company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and resources. Some of the risks encountered in the research and development process include the following: pre-clinical testing of a new compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be disappointing.\n\nThe Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire compounds, product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies.

      "answer": "In 2023, LLY's Jardiance was selected under Medicare\u2019s government-set pricing program as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signaling early regulatory pressure on pricing (from hop1_evidence). This selection, which would result in a 66% discount from the 2023 list price effective in 2026, contributed to broader pricing pressures faced by the company in 2024 (from hop2_evidence). By 2024, LLY explicitly noted that this development accelerated revenue erosion concerns and intensified scrutiny over pricing, particularly for high-profile products like Jardiance, which is part of a key therapeutic area (diabetes) already under payer focus (from hop3_evidence). Thus, the 2023 Medicare inclusion directly shaped LLY\u2019s 2024 risk profile by amplifying expectations of future revenue constraints and increasing current-year pricing sensitivity from both public and private payers.",

          "chunk_text": "Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.\n\nAbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\nCost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business-Regulation-Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing.\" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, European Union member states and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future.\n\nAbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, as well as federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, contribute to pricing pressures. In particular, the IRA will have the effect of reducing prices and reimbursements for certain of our products, which could significantly impact AbbVie's results of operations. Under the IRA, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services can effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices can apply as soon as nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. In August 2023, HHS, through the CMS, selected Imbruvica as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. In August 2024, the CMS published Medicare Part D prices that will be applicable to these medicines, including Imbruvica, beginning January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS, through the CMS, selected Vraylar and Linzess as two of the 15 medicines subject to government-set prices in Medicare Part D beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. In addition, beginning in January 2025, under the IRA, the 70% coverage gap discount program was replaced by a 10% manufacturer discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and i ncurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20% discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold under the new Part D benefit redesign. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. The IRA has and will continue to meaningfully impact AbbVie's business strategies and those of others in the pharmaceutical i ndustry. The full impact of the IRA on AbbVie's business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of our or a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nAbbVie continues to evaluate the impact that the IRA may have on the company. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries may result in additional pricing pressures.\n\nIn major markets worldwide, governments play a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries' pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in revenues and operating earnings.\n\nRebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

          "chunk_text": "commerce may increase the prevalence of dangerous counterfeit or div erted products and scams, potentially exposing patients to significant risks. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or div erted drugs sold under our brand name, which may also impact our business and financial results.\n\nIn addition, we rely on our ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled scientific, technical, management, and other personnel in order to compete effectiv ely. To continue to commercialize our products, and adv ance the research, dev elopment, and commercialization of additional modalities, indications, and product candidates, we hav e expanded, and will likely need to further expand, our workforce, both in and outside the U.S. We continue to face intense competition for qualified indiv iduals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic and other research institutions, as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities, which has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our failure to compete effectiv ely for talent could negativ ely affect sales of our current and any future approved products and indications, and could result in material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to our business.\n\n- Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation or business.\n\nPublic and priv ate payers continue to take aggressiv e steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medicines. These pressures hav e negativ ely affected, and we expect will continue to negativ ely affect, our consolidated results of operations. Gov ernments and priv ate payers worldwide hav e intensified their scrutiny of, and actions intended to address, pricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical products and are demanding greater commercial and clinical v alue from pharmaceutical companies in the form of strong product differentiation and demonstrated v alue. We continue to experience scrutiny on the pricing of current and potential diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease products due to payer concern ov er projected growth in these markets and, for certain of these drugs, the anticipated duration of treatment. We hav e also observ ed scrutiny of pricing and access disparities across jurisdictions.\n\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including because of the regulatory priorities of the U.S. executiv e branch and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, in August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices in Medicare effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the gov ernment-set prices for these first ten medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. Within the U.S., state lev el transparency initiativ es, importation rules, reporting requirements, and mandated programs, including the establishment of drug affordability boards with the power to set upper payment limits on certain drugs in state-regulated plans, hav e also increased administrativ e costs, in some cases, compromised confidential business practices and otherwise detrimentally impacted our business. Certain states hav e also undertaken efforts to codify 340B contract pharmacies into statute or impose other state law mandates, which increase the cost of 340B programs. To date, sev eral states hav e passed contract pharmacy legislation, which hav e been subject to v arious legal challenges. For more details, see Item 1, \"Business-Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access.\"\n\nFurther, restrictiv e or unfav orable pricing, cov erage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by gov ernments, regulatory agencies, courts, or priv ate payers, including in relation to the implementation of the IRA, reference pricing, and compulsory licensing, may adversely impact our business and financial results. We continue to experience additional pricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting from periods of unev en economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts.",

By 2024, Pfizer maintained an ongoing financial relationship with Viatris through various agreements established at the time of the spin-off, including manufacturing and supply agreements (MSAs), transition services agreements (TSAs), and agency arrangements. These agreements included transitional support such as billing, rebate management, and product manufacturing. As of December 31, 2024, Pfizer reported net amounts due to Viatris under these agreements at $105 million, up from $33 million as of December 31, 2023, indicating a continued but maturing post-spin-off relationship.",

T he interim  agency operating m odel arrangem ents prim arily include billings, collections and rem ittance of rebates that we are perform ing on a transitional basis on behalf of Viatris. U nder the M SAs, P fizer or Viatris, as the case m ay be, m anufactures, labels and packages products for the other party. T he term s of the M SAs range in initial duration from  four to seven years post-separation. Services under the T SAs were largely com pleted as of D ecem ber 31, 2023. Am ounts recorded under the above agreem ents in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not m aterial to our operations. N et am ounts due to Viatris under the above agreem ents were $105 m illion as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and $33 m illion as of D ecem ber 31, 2023. T he cash flows associated with the above agreem ents are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities.\n\n## C. Equity-Method Investments\n\nHaleon-Haleon, is an independent, publicly traded com pany listed on the London Stock E xchange that holds the joint historical consum er healthcare business of G SK and P fizer. W e owned 32% of Haleon as of D ecem ber 31, 2023. In M arch 2024, we sold approxim ately 30% of our investm ent in H aleon through the sale of 791 m illion ordinary shares in a global public offering, and the sale of 102 m illion ordinary shares directly to H aleon, for $3.5 billion. I n O ctober 2024, we sold approxim ately 34% of our rem aining investm ent in H aleon through the sale of 640 m illion ordinary shares in a global public offering, and the sale of 61 m illion ordinary shares directly to H aleon, for $3.5 billion. W e recognized total gains on these sales of our H aleon shares of $945 m illion during 2024 in Other (income)/deductions--net (see Note 4 ). After the O ctober 2024 share sale, we owned approxim ately 15% of the outstanding voting shares of H aleon as of D ecem ber 31, 2024.\n\nThrough the third quarter of 2024, we accounted for our H aleon investm ent under the equity m ethod and recorded our share of earnings from  H aleon on a quarterly basis on a onequarter lag in Other (income)/deductions--net . As H aleon is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U .K. pound, we translated its financial statem ents into U .S. dollars and recognized the im pact of foreign currency translation adjustm ents in the carrying value of our investm ent and in other com prehensive incom e. W ith the reduction in our H aleon ownership percentage and board representation after the October 2024 sale, we no longer have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Haleon. As a result, we discontinued the application of the equity m ethod to our H aleon investm ent, and began to account for the investm ent as an equity security with a readily determ inable fair value, which is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions--net . See Note 4.\n\n## The following table sum m arizes the change in the carrying value of our investm ent in H aleon:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the shift in Otezla's development focus between 2022 and the amortization of its developed product technology rights affect Amgen's intangible asset valuation strategy by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Otezla was actively being used in mild-to-moderate psoriasis and had FDA approval, while its developed product technology rights were valued using a multiperiod excess earnings income approach and amortized over 8.5 years. By 2024, Amgen's 10-K filing indicated that developed-product-technology rights were now part of a broader portfolio that included licensing and marketing rights, suggesting a more diversified intangible asset strategy. This evolution shows that Amgen transitioned from a focus on Otezla's direct therapeutic application in 2022 to a broader valuation framework that incorporated its IP and commercial rights by 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN(2022) \u2192 Otezla: Otezla was approved for mild-to-moderate psoriasis and was under investigation for other indications, including COVID-19 (which was later terminated).",

By 2023, the collaboration terms clarified that Gilead recognizes its share of Symtuza revenue in the period when Janssen's corresponding sales occur, as the license was deemed the predominant item tied to the revenue share. This shift in emphasis from general inclusion to specific timing alignment indicates a refinement in how Gilead accounts for Symtuza revenue, directly linking it to Janssen's commercial performance.

          "chunk_text": "For information about our revenue-generating products, including the amount of revenue contributed by the products listed above, see Note 2. Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Revenue Share and Other Revenues\n\nWe also generate revenues from other activities, including revenue share from combination products, royalties for outbound licenses of our intellectual property and other payments received from our collaborations with third-party partners. For example, pursuant to our collaboration with Janssen, we receive revenue share from cobicistat, emtricitabine and TAF that are components of Symtuza (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/TAF), a fixed-dose combination product commercialized by Janssen. We include our revenue share from Symtuza in our Product sales. For a description of our collaborations with Janssen and other partners, see Note 11. Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Commercialization and Distribution\n\nWe have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in more than 35 countries. Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial  teams  promote  our  products  through  direct  field  contact  with  physicians,  hospitals,  clinics  and  other  healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts between the distributor and Gilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the United States exclusively through the wholesale channel. During the year ended  December  31,  2021,  approximately  91%  of  our  product  sales  in  the  United  States  and  approximately  65%  of  our  total worldwide  revenues  were  to  three  large  wholesalers,  AmerisourceBergen  Corporation,  Cardinal  Health,  Inc.  and  McKesson Corporation. We sell and distribute our products in Europe and countries outside the United States where the product is approved, either through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe  operate  in  a  highly  competitive  environment.  We  face  significant  competition  from  global  pharmaceutical  and biotechnology  companies,  specialized  pharmaceutical  firms  and  generic  drug  manufacturers.  Our  products  compete  with  other commercially available products based primarily on efficacy, safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease  of  use,  price,  insurance  and  other  reimbursement  coverage,  distribution  and  marketing.  As  our  products  mature,  pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices. Further, as new branded or generic products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur research and development ('R&amp;D') mission is to discover and develop transformational therapies in areas of high unmet medical need. Our product development efforts are focused primarily in viral diseases, inflammatory diseases and oncology. Our team of research scientists is engaged in the discovery and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to the approval of innovative medicines and therapies that will advance the current standard of care and address unmet medical needs. We intend to continue committing significant resources to internal R&amp;D opportunities and external business development activity to drive innovation and growth of our business.\n\nThe  development  of  product  candidates  and  investigational  therapies  in  our  pipeline  is  subject  to  various  risks  and uncertainties. These  risks  and  uncertainties  include  our  ability  to  enroll  patients  in  clinical  trials,  the  possibility  of  unfavorable results  of  our  clinical  trials,  the  need  to  modify  or  delay  our  clinical  trials,  including  on  account  of  clinical  holds  placed  by regulatory authorities, or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain regulatory approvals. As a result, our product candidates  and  investigational  therapies  may  never  be  successfully  commercialized.  Drug  development  is  inherently  risky,  and many product candidates and investigational therapies fail during the development process.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to invest in and advance our R&amp;D pipeline across our therapeutic areas. Below is a summary of our product candidates that were in Phase 3 or registrational Phase 2 clinical trials or pending marketing authorization review by FDA or European Medicines Agency ('EMA') as of the end of 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen listed HUMIRA as a direct competitor to its products Otezla and ENBREL, indicating strong market presence of HUMIRA in the U.S. and Europe. In response, Amgen developed AMJEVITA, a biosimilar to HUMIRA, which by 2024 had advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials focused on establishing interchangeability. This strategic move suggests that Amgen aimed to counter HUMIRA's dominance by offering a biosimilar with potential cost and usage advantages. The progression from competitive threat in 2022 to biosimilar development milestone in 2024 reflects a clear shift in Amgen's strategy from rivalry to competitive replication and differentiation.",

The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected.\n\n## AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\n\nAbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.\n\nAdditionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate.\n\n## AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties.\n\nIn 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  a  requirement  for  at  least  10  years  of  data  exclusivity  for  biologic  products.  Also,  the  FDA  is  considering  whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as 'umbrella exclusivity'). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does  not  apply  to  biological  reference  products  or  were  to  make  other  changes  to  the  exclusivity  period,  this  could  expose  us  to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition  through  policies  enabling  easier  generic  and  biosimilar  approval  and  commercialization,  including  efforts  to  lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential  reimbursement  policies  for  biosimilars  and  pass  new  laws  requiring  more  disclosure  in  the  FDA's  Orange  and  Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered  training  to  help  identify  prior  art,  and  seeking  USPTO's  views  on  practices  that  extend  market  exclusivities,  whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the PTAB on drug patents.\n\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents and unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product by an additional six months.\n\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first  state  to  have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against 'pay for delay' settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement  agreements  are  presumptively  anticompetitive.  The  law  may  result  in  prolonged  litigation  and  fewer  settlements.  Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.\n\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\n\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three  pharmaceutical  product  wholesaler  distributors:  McKesson  Corporation, AmerisourceBergen  Corporation  and  Cardinal  Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis  facilities  located  in  the  United  States  and  accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  all  EPOGEN sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs  now  oversee  a  substantial  percentage  of  total  covered  lives  in  the  United  States.  See Our  sales  depend  on  coverage  and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely  to  continue  to  affect,  our  profitability. The  three  largest  PBMs  in  the  United  States  are  now  part  of  major  health  insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing  volume.  Further,  if  one  of  our  significant  wholesale  distributors  encounters  financial  or  other  difficulties  and  becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&amp;D.\n\nAmgen invests heavily in R&amp;D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&amp;D projects yield approved and commercially viable products.

(Dermira) and Loxo Oncology, Inc. (Loxo), respectively. These transactions, as further discussed in this note below in Acquisitions of Businesses, were accounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has been recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\n\nWe also acquired assets in development in 2021, 2020, and 2019, which are further discussed in this note below in Asset Acquisitions. Upon each acquisition, the cost allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D was immediately expensed because the compound acquired had no alternative future use. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recorded acquired IPR&amp;D charges of $874.9 million, $660.4 million, and $239.6 million, respectively.\n\n## Acquisitions of Businesses\n\n## Prevail Acquisition\n\n## Overview of Transaction\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. To achieve the full value of the CVR, such regulatory approval must occur by December 31, 2024. If such regulatory approval occurs after December 31, 2024, the value of the CVR will be reduced by approximately 8.3 cents per month until December 1, 2028, at which point the CVR will expire without payment.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition establishes a new modality for drug discovery and development, extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets. The lead gene therapies in clinical development that we acquired were PR001 for patients with Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations and neuronopathic Gaucher disease and PR006 for patients with frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations. Both PR001 and PR006 were granted Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

      "question": "How did JNJ's approach to defending its patent portfolio against generic manufacturers like Mylan evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what impact did court outcomes have on its ability to maintain market exclusivity?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ (via JPI and Bayer) filed patent infringement lawsuits against multiple generic manufacturers, including Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc., to prevent early market entry of generic XARELTO before the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 10,828,310. By 2023, the litigation landscape had evolved significantly: the USPTO invalidated Patent No. 10,828,310 in July 2023, prompting an appeal by Bayer. Meanwhile, JNJ continued aggressive litigation against Mylan in other areas\u2014most notably in the INVEGA TRINZA case, where a court ruled Mylan\u2019s generic product infringed on U.S. Patent No. 10,143,693, a decision that Mylan appealed in May 2023. These developments show JNJ's evolving strategy of maintaining market exclusivity through continued litigation while adapting to adverse IP rulings, particularly on key high-revenue drugs like XARELTO and INVEGA TRINZA.",

      "question": "How did the $80 million decline in Janssen's cost of goods sold from 2022 to 2024 reflect the changing dynamics of Gilead's partnership as Complera/Eviplera approached its 2025 U.S. patent expiration?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead reported $483 million in cost of goods sold related to Janssen\u2019s share of Complera/Eviplera revenues, which declined to $403 million by 2024. This $80 million drop over two years coincides with the approaching 2025 U.S. patent expiration of Complera/Eviplera, suggesting reduced sales or renegotiated revenue-sharing terms as market exclusivity neared its end. The partnership structure, where Gilead retained a specified percentage of Janssen's share (up to 30% in major markets), likely adjusted as both parties anticipated generic competition. This decline reflects a strategic shift in Gilead\u2019s financial exposure to the collaboration as the product nears the end of its protected lifecycle, aligning with the broader context of patent-driven revenue planning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GILD(2022) \u2192 Complera/Eviplera: Gilead disclosed Complera/Eviplera's U.S. patent expiration in 2025 and EU in 2026, signaling the impending loss of exclusivity.",
        "Hop 2: Complera/Eviplera \u2192 Janssen: Gilead and Janssen shared revenues from Complera/Eviplera sales, with Gilead retaining a portion of Janssen\u2019s share (up to 30% in major markets), and Janssen distributing in certain countries.",
        "Hop 3: Janssen \u2190 GILD(2024): By 2024, the cost of goods sold related to Janssen\u2019s share had dropped to $403 million, down from $483 million in 2022, indicating a shift in the financial dynamics of the partnership."

          "chunk_text": "Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, we purchased new ordinary shares of Galapagos and were issued warrants that confer the right to subscribe, from time to time, for a number of new shares to be issued by G alapagos sufficient to bring the number of shares owned by us to 29.9% of the issued and outstanding shares at the time of our exercises. We currently own 16.7 million shares or approximately 25.8% of the shares issued and outstanding at the time of last purchase in 2019. We are subject to a 10-year standstill restricting our ability to acquire voting securities of G alapagos ex ceeding more than 29.9% of the then-issued and outstanding voting securities of Galapagos. We have two designees appointed to Galapagos' board of directors as of December 31, 2024.\n\nIn January 2025, we agreed to amend the OLCA commensurate with Galapagos' announcement for a planned separation of G alapagos into two entities: a newly to be formed company (to be named at a later date, herein 'SpinCo') with an initial capital allocation of up to approximately \u20ac2.45 billion (approximately $2.54 billion) and Galapagos. At the time of separation, should it occur, G alapagos' and our rights and responsibilities under the OLCA would transfer to SpinCo, and G alapagos would gain full global development and commercialization rights to its pipeline, subject to payment of single digit royalties to G ilead on net sales of certain products. This separation is expected to occur by mid-2025. With respect to G ilead's ownership stake in G alapagos, upon separation, G ilead will hold approximately 25% of the outstanding shares in both G alapagos and SpinCo and will be subject to a lock-up of G alapagos shares through March 2027 and of SpinCo shares until six months after the separation, subject to certain customary exceptions and early termination provisions. The two G ilead designees appointed to G alapagos' board of directors will step down upon the separation and Gilead will be entitled to nominate two directors to SpinCo's board.\n\n## Janssen\n\n## Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey\n\nIn  2009,  we  entered  into  a  license  and  collaboration  agreement  with  Janssen  to  develop  and  commercialize  a  fix ed-dose  combination  of  our  Truvada  and Janssen's non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, rilpivirine. This combination was approved in the U.S. and EU in 2011, and is sold under the brand name Complera in the U.S. and Eviplera in the EU. The agreement was amended in 2014 to expand the collaboration to include another product containing Janssen's rilpivirine and our emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide ('Odefsey').\n\nUnder the amended agreement, Janssen granted us an exclusive license to Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey worldwide, but retained rights to distribute both combination products in certain countries outside of the U.S. Neither party is restricted from combining its drugs with any other drug products except those which are similar to the components of Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey.\n\nWe are responsible for manufacturing Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey and have the lead role in registration, distribution and commercialization of both products except in the countries where Janssen distributes. Janssen has exercised a right to co-detail the combination product in some of the countries where we are the selling party.\n\nUnder the financial provisions of the 2014 amendment, the selling party sets the price of the combined products and the parties share revenues based on the ratio of the net selling prices of the party's component(s), subject to certain restrictions and adjustments. We retain a specified percentage of Janssen's share of revenues, including up to 30% in major markets. Sales of these products are included in Product sales and Janssen's share of revenues is included in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cost of goods sold relating to Janssen's share was $403 million, $430 million and $483 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including withdrawal of a product from the market, material breach by either party or expiry of the revenue share payment term. We may terminate the agreement without cause with respect to the countries where we sell the products.\n\n## Symtuza\n\nIn 2014, we amended a license and collaboration agreement with Janssen to develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of Janssen's darunavir and our cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide ('G ilead Compounds'). This combination was approved in the U.S. and EU in July 2018 and September 2017, respectively, and is sold under the brand name Symtuza.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2014 amendment, we granted Janssen an exclusive license to Symtuza worldwide. Janssen is responsible for manufacturing, registration, distribution and commercialization of Symtuza worldwide. We are responsible for the intellectual property related to the G ilead Compounds and are the exclusive supplier  of  the  G ilead  Compounds.  Neither  party  is  restricted  from  combining  its  drugs  with  any  other  drug  products  ex cept  those  which  are  similar  to  the components of Symtuza.",

The intellectual property license and supply obligations related to the G ilead Compounds are accounted for as a single performance obligation. As the license was deemed to be the predominant item to which the revenue share relates, we recognize our share of the Symtuza revenue in the period when the corresponding sales of Symtuza by Janssen occur. We record our share of the Symtuza revenue as Product sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily because we supply the Gilead Compounds to Janssen for Symtuza.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including withdrawal of a product from the market, material breach by either party or expiry of the revenue share payment term. Janssen may terminate the agreement without cause on a country-by-country basis, in which case Gilead has the right to become the selling party for such country(ies) if the product has launched but has been on the market for fewer than 10 years. Janssen may also terminate the entire agreement without cause.\n\n## Japan Tobacco\n\nIn 2005, Japan Tobacco, Inc. ('Japan Tobacco') granted us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir, a novel HIV  integrase inhibitor, in all countries of the world, excluding Japan, where Japan Tobacco retained such rights. Effective December 2018, we entered into an agreement with Japan Tobacco to acquire the rights to market and distribute certain products in our HIV  portfolio in Japan and to ex pand our rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir to include Japan. We are responsible for the marketing of the products as of January 1, 2019.\n\nWe are responsible for seeking regulatory approval in our territories and are required to use diligent efforts to commercialize elvitegravir for the treatment of HIV infection. We bear all costs and expenses associated with such commercialization efforts and pay a royalty to Japan Tobacco based on our product sales. Our sales of these products are included in Product sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Royalties due to Japan Tobacco are included in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Royalty expenses recognized were $139 million, $167 million and $198 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2018 agreement, we paid Japan Tobacco $559 million in cash and recognized an intangible asset of $550 million reflecting the estimated fair value of the marketing-related rights acquired from Japan Tobacco. The intangible asset is being amortized over nine years, representing the period over which the majority of the benefits are ex pected to be derived from the applicable products in our HIV  portfolio. The amortization ex pense is classified as selling ex pense and recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including material breach by either party or expiry of royalty payment term. We may also terminate the entire agreement without cause.\n\n## Everest\n\nIn April 2019, Everest Medicines ('Everest') and Immunomedics entered into an agreement granting Everest an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Trodelvy in  G reater  China,  South  Korea,  Singapore,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  V ietnam,  Thailand,  Malaysia  and  Mongolia  (the  'Territories').  G ilead  subsequently acquired Immunomedics in October 2020 and assumed the Everest license and supply agreement, which provided for certain sales milestones and royalties payments to  be  made to  G ilead  and  was  recorded  as  a  $175  million  finite-lived  asset  as  part  of  the  purchase  accounting.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022,  we  reacquired  all development and commercialization rights for Trodelvy from Everest and terminated the previous agreement. Under the terms of the new agreement, G ilead made $280 million in upfront termination payments to Everest, of which $84 million was made in 2022 and $196 million was made in 2023. In addition, Everest is eligible to receive up to $175 million in potential additional payments upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. We accounted for the new agreement as a contract termination, which includes the reacquisition of commercial rights and the settlement of our pre-existing relationship with Everest. As a result, we recorded an expense of $406 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022, which primarily represents the upfront costs and write-off of the remaining value of the pre-existing asset related to the prior agreement. Simultaneously, we recorded an acquired finite-lived asset with a fair value of $50 million for the commercial rights reacquired for products approved in the Territories.",

      "question": "How did Merck KGaA's ongoing corporate name infringement litigation against MRK evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about MRK's brand protection strategy in the U.S.?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MRK was engaged in ongoing litigation with Merck KGaA in the U.S. and abroad, where MRK alleged improper use of the 'Merck' name by KGaA in the U.S., while KGaA filed suits in other jurisdictions alleging trademark and corporate name infringement. By 2024, the litigation remained ongoing in both the U.S. and international jurisdictions, with no trial date set in the U.S., indicating that MRK continued to pursue its brand protection strategy without resolution. This persistence in litigation across years shows MRK's commitment to defending its U.S. brand identity against KGaA's global legal challenges.",

The Company and plaintiffs each appealed the class certification decision. The Court of A ppeal of Quebec amended the class period to start July 2, 2014, allowed the second plaintiff to serve as a class representative, and modified the list of conditions in the class definition. The Company sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which was denied. The case is proceeding in the Superior Court.\n\n## 340B Program Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, M erck filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge the letter M erck received from the U.S. Health Resources and Services A dministration (HRSA ) in M ay 2022 regarding M erck's 340B Program integrity initiative. On September 17, 2024, the court entered a consent judgment granting M erck the relief it had sought in the litigation, including declarations that HRSA 's M ay 2022 letter was unlawful and that the version of Merck's 340B Program integrity initiative at issue in the litigation did not violate Section 340B on its face.\n\n## Qui Tam Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania unsealed a complaint that had been filed against the Company under the federal False Claims A ct by two former employees alleging, among other things, that the Company defrauded the U.S. government by falsify ing data in connection with a clinical study conducted on the mumps component of the Company's M-M-R II v accine. The complaint alleges the fraud took place between 1999 and 2001. The U.S. government had the right to participate in and take over the prosecution of this lawsuit but notified the court that it declined to exercise that right. The two former employees pursued the lawsuit without the involvement of the U.S. government. In July 2023, the court denied relators'  motion  for  summary  judgment,  granted two of the  Company's motions for summary judgment, and denied the Company's remaining motions for summary judgment as moot. The court entered judgment in favor of the Company and dismissed relators' amended complaint in full with prejudice. Relators appealed that decision, and in A ugust 2024, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's decision.\n\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, two putative class action lawsuits on behalf of direct purchasers of the M -M -R II v accine, which charge that the Company misrepresented the efficacy of the M-M-R II v accine in v iolation of federal antitrust laws and v arious state consumer protection laws, are pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' state law claims and denied the motion as to plaintiffs' antitrust claim. The Company appealed, and on October 7, 2024, the Third Circuit reversed-in-part the district court's order and remanded the case with instructions to enter summary judgment for the Company . On November 20, 2024, plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, and on February 10, 2025, the court denied the petition.\n\n## Merck KGaA Litigation\n\nAs previously disclosed, in January 2016, to protect its long-established brand rights in the U.S., the Company filed a lawsuit against M erck KGaA , Darmstadt, Germany (KGaA), historically operating as the EM D Group in the U.S., alleging it improperly uses the name 'M erck' in the U.S. KGaA  has filed suit against the Company in a number of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. alleging, among other things, unfair competition, trademark infringement and/or corporate name infringement. In certain of those jurisdictions, KGaA  also alleges breach of the parties' coexistence agreement. The litigation is ongoing in the U.S. with no trial date set, and also ongoing in jurisdictions outside of the U.S.\n\n## Patent Litigation\n\nFrom time to time, generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products file abbreviated New Drug A pplications (A NDA s) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) seeking to market generic forms of the Company's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned by the Company . T o protect its patent rights, the Company may file patent infringement lawsuits against such generic companies. Similar lawsuits defending the Company's patent rights may exist in other countries. The Company intends to vigorously defend its patents, which it believes are valid, against infringement by companies attempting to market products prior to the expiration of such patents. A s with any litigation, there can be no assurance of the outcomes, which, if adverse, could result in significantly  shortened  periods  of  exclusivity  for  these  products  and,  with  respect  to  products  acquired  through  acquisitions  accounted  for  as  business combinations, potentially significant intangible asset impairment charges.\n\nBridion -As previously disclosed, between January and November 2020, the Company received multiple Paragraph IV  Certification Letters under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying the Company that generic drug companies had filed applications to the FDA  seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of Bridion (sugammadex)",

      "answer": "In 2022, Merck disclosed that it shared Lenvima profits equally with Eisai, with Eisai acting as the principal on all Lenvima sales transactions. By 2024, Merck's cost of sales included $154 million in cumulative catch-up amortization related to the Eisai collaboration, up from $48 million in 2023, indicating increased financial activity tied to the partnership. This rise in amortization costs contributed to a 3.1 percentage point improvement in gross margin (from 73.2% in 2023 to 76.3% in 2024), despite higher amortization and restructuring costs, suggesting that the collaboration's financial structure and product mix had a net positive effect on Merck's profitability.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer faced significant pricing pressures in China due to government-led initiatives such as the Volume-Based Procurement (VBP) program and bioequivalence testing under the QCE process, which dramatically reduced prices for off-patent medicines and negatively impacted Pfizer's competitiveness in that market. This pressure on revenue from generic competition was compounded in 2023 by increased promotion of generic drugs and biosimilars by U.S. payors, who sought cost containment through formulary restrictions and rebate negotiations. These dual pressures\u2014international price erosion and domestic market share loss to generics\u2014directly contributed to Pfizer\u2019s 2023 financial challenges, including a 42% drop in net cash flow from operations to $8.7 billion and a 70% decline in reported diluted EPS to $0.37.

          "chunk_text": "In China, pricing pressures have increased in recent years because of an overall focus on healthcare cost containment with government officials emphasizing improved health outcomes, healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards reform. For patented products, drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative drugs (including oncology medicines) to the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). In the off-patent space, numerous local generics have been officially deemed bioequivalent under a QCE process that required domestically-manufactured generic drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug (typically the originator drug). A centralized VBP program, a tender process where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners and is intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed QCE, has resulted in dramatic price cuts for off-patent medicines. Furthermore, the Chinese government has discussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between QCE-approved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines, which the government currently plans to implement within the next few years. We and most off-patent originators have mostly not been successful in the VBP bidding process. The government has indicated that additional post-LOE drugs could be subjected to VBP qualification in future rounds. While certain details of future QCE expansion have been made available, we are unable to determine the impact on our business and financial condition until the initiation of these future rounds.\n\nHealthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. Several countries have implemented laws requiring (or industry trade associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers and/or healthcare organizations, such as academic teaching hospitals.\n\nIntellectual Property . Reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and R&amp;D investment. The WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) requires participant countries to provide patent and other intellectual property-related protection for pharmaceutical products by law, with an exemption provided for least-developed countries until 2033. While some countries have made improvements, we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries.\n\nWhile the global intellectual property policy environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our growth and ability to bring new product innovation to patients depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In certain developed international markets, governments maintain relatively effective intellectual property policies. However, in the EU, pursuant to the ongoing review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives, legislative change may result in the reduction of certain protections. In several emerging market countries, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines, as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals. Discussions are ongoing at the WTO that seek to limit intellectual property protections within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response.\n\nConsiderable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions, revocation of patents, laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection.\n\nOur industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers, underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries and helping improve patients' access to innovative medicines and vaccines.\n\nData Privacy. Outside of the U.S., many countries have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data, including but not limited to, the EU's General Data Protection Regulations and China's Personal Information Protection Law. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is also rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt new and updated privacy and data security laws. The interpretation and application of such laws and regulations remain uncertain and continue to evolve. In addition, enforcement of such laws and regulations is increasing.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\nOur operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. We incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2021 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows: $55 million in environment-related capital expenditures and $152 million in other environment-related expenses.\n\nWhile capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position. See also Note 16A3 .\n\nClimate change presents risks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, the potential for more frequent and severe weather events, and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities or supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future. We periodically review our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and other natural disasters and update our assessments accordingly. Based on our reviews, we do not believe these potential risks are material to our operations at this time.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nOur purpose is: Breakthroughs that change patients' lives . These breakthroughs are delivered through the relentless collaboration of our talented workforce. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 79,000 people worldwide, with approximately 29,000 based in the U.S. Women compose approximately 49% of our global workforce, and approximately 34% of our U.S.-based employees are individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds.\n\nOur continued success links directly to the commitment, engagement and performance of our employees. It is important that we not only attract and retain the best and brightest diverse talent, but also ensure they remain engaged and can thrive in an environment that is committed to helping them grow, succeed and contribute directly to achieving our purpose. As part of these efforts, we strive for an inclusive and empowering work environment, adopting practices to simplify processes and remove needless complexity, rewarding both performance and leadership skills,\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n12",

      "answer": "The valuation of MDT's equity commingled trusts remained unchanged at $1,211 million in both fiscal years 2023 and 2024, indicating a stable portfolio management strategy for these specific investments. Since these trusts are measured at net asset value (NAV) and the amount has not shifted between reporting periods, it suggests that MDT maintained its exposure to this asset class without significant reallocation or rebalancing. This consistency may signal a deliberate long-duration investment approach or a strategic decision to preserve capital in this segment of the portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2023, U.S. Aranesp sales declined due to lower unit demand as independent and medium-sized dialysis organizations transitioned to EPOGEN, contributing to an overall decrease in global Aranesp sales driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. By 2024, global Aranesp sales remained relatively unchanged despite continued unfavorable changes in estimated sales deductions and foreign currency exchange rates, suggesting that volume growth outside the U.S. offset these negative factors. This indicates a geographic shift in demand and pricing pressure management strategies between the two years.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MRK and Bayer AG maintained a joint development and commercialization agreement where Bayer commercialized Adempas in the Americas and MRK handled international markets. By 2024, MRK was still producing and selling Adempas internationally, with international sales of Adempas reported at $287 million in 2024, up from $238 million in 2022. During this time, MRK's alliance revenue from the Adempas/Verquvo partnership increased from $341 million in 2022 to $415 million in 2024, indicating a strengthening of the financial outcomes from the collaboration. This evolution suggests that MRK's strategic role in the partnership, particularly in international markets, became more impactful over time.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AbbVie faced significant risks to market exclusivity due to ongoing patent litigation and Paragraph IV certifications from generic manufacturers, threatening the commercial life of its key products and exposing them to early generic competition. These challenges, combined with regulatory and legislative pressures, heightened AbbVie\u2019s reliance on alternative exclusivity mechanisms. In response, by 2024, AbbVie strategically leveraged the FDA's pediatric exclusivity provision, which allows for a 180-day extension of existing exclusivity periods when new clinical studies on pediatric use are conducted. This regulatory mechanism enabled AbbVie to extend market protection for several biologics, mitigating the revenue risk posed by the earlier patent challenges and aligning with its broader IP lifecycle management strategy.",

The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies.\n\nFurthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product i s  i nterchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\n\nGenerally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie's i ntellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a 'patent term restoration,' for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration.\n\nPharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Specific conditions of use approved for individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA's reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval i n any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.\n\nBiologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

      "question": "How did Amgen's 2022 initiation of the Bemarituzumab phase 3 study for GEJ adenocarcinoma influence the company's 2023 intellectual property disclosures related to polypeptides, particularly in terms of patent expiration timelines?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen initiated the phase 3 study for Bemarituzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting polypeptides for the treatment of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. This molecule was linked to polypeptide-related intellectual property, with patents in the U.S. and Europe both expiring in 2029. By 2023, Amgen disclosed broader polypeptide-related patents across multiple products, including TEZSPIRE and BLINCYTO, with expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2038. Notably, Bemarituzumab\u2019s polypeptide-related IP expiration remained at 2029, aligning with the broader polypeptide patent strategy but lagging behind newer disclosures like TEZSPIRE (U.S. polypeptide patent until 2029) and significantly ahead of BLINCYTO\u2019s European polypeptide patent expiration in 2024. This suggests that the 2022 phase 3 initiation for Bemarituzumab reinforced Amgen\u2019s commitment to maintaining polypeptide-based IP protection through the late 2020s.",

      "question": "How did the geographic licensing strategy for Opdivo, particularly in Japan through BMY's partnership with Ono, evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what impact did this have on BMY's global commercialization rights and royalty obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY disclosed that Opdivo was being developed and commercialized globally, with Ono acting as the alliance partner in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Ono was actively announcing regulatory approvals in Japan for new indications of Opdivo, such as for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma and in combination therapies for RCC and malignant pleural mesothelioma. By 2023, BMY clarified that it retained exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize Opdivo worldwide except in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, where Ono was entitled to receive 15% royalties on sales outside North America. This indicates a strategic delineation of geographic rights, with BMY leveraging Ono\u2019s local capabilities in Asia while maintaining global control elsewhere, and formalizing royalty obligations based on regional performance.",

        "Hop 1: BMY(2022) \u2192 Opdivo: BMY disclosed Opdivo as a key biologic product facing biosimilar competition risks and noted Ono's role in Japan for regulatory approvals.",

        "Hop 3: Ono \u2190 BMY(2023): BMY clarified that Ono receives 15% royalties on Opdivo sales outside North America in exchange for commercialization rights in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan."

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

          "chunk_text": "The U.S., EU and Japan each provide regulatory data protection, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic copy. In certain markets where patent protection  and  other  forms  of  market  exclusivity  may  have  expired,  regulatory  data  protection  can  be  of  particular  importance. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data protection exclusivity on the basis of the competitor's own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to  that  marketed  by  the  innovator. When  these  patent  rights  and  other  forms  of  exclusivity  expire  and  generic versions  of  a  medicine  are  approved  and  marketed,  there  are  often  substantial  and  rapid  declines  in  the  sales  of  the  original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic competition on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity and data regulatory protection for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country. The following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the  innovator  may,  depending  on  a  number  of  factors,  apply  to  the  government  to  restore  lost  patent  term  by  extending  the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If  the  innovative  pharmaceutical  is  a  chemical  product,  the  company  files  an  NDA.  If  the  medicine  is  a  biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity. The type of application filed can affect regulatory data protection exclusivity rights as discussed below.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the U.S. must file an aNDA with the FDA. In the aNDA, the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The aNDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.\n\nAn innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an aNDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an aNDA and allege that  one  or  more  of  the  patents  listed  in  the  Orange  Book  under  an  innovator's  NDA  is  invalid,  unenforceable,  or  will  not  be infringed  by  the  generic  product. This  allegation  is  commonly  known  as  a  Paragraph  IV  certification. The  innovator  then  must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, aNDAs including Paragraph IV certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these aNDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines  approved  under  an  NDA  can  also  receive  several  types  of  regulatory  data  protection.  An  innovative  chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory data protection in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, as described above, a generic manufacturer may file its aNDA after the fourth year of the five-year regulatory data protection period. A pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an NDA, but is approved in, for example, a new formulation or a new route of administration, but not  for  the  drug  itself,  or  for  a  new  indication  on  the  basis  of  new  clinical  studies,  may  receive  three  years  of  regulatory  data protection for that formulation, route of administration, or indication.",

          "chunk_text": "individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA's reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.\n\nBiologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products.\n\nAbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications.\n\nThese patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2022 to the early 2040s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie's business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the company's business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the licenses in the United States will begin in 2023 and the licenses in Europe began in 2018.\n\nIn addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica) and those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027, however no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033.\n\nAbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie's trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie's employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.",

By 2024, Trulicity faced increasing competitive pressures as its intellectual property protections were set to expire in the next few years, as noted in the 2024 10-K filing. This led to a 32% decline in U.S. revenue, driven by reduced volume due to competitive dynamics and supply constraints during the first half of the year. The erosion of exclusivity, which was already flagged as a risk in 2022 under data protection regulations, directly contributed to the loss of market share and pricing pressure. As a result, LLY experienced a measurable financial impact in 2024, aligning with the earlier warnings about the consequences of losing effective intellectual property protection.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Private Sector Dynamics\n\nIn the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare providers significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion.\n\nFormulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels, and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in pricing and usage negotiation, and compete fiercely for formulary placement, not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy, safety profile, or patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. As payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and pricing, value-based agreements, where pricing is based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes, are another tool that may become increasingly prevalent. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. We expect these downward pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see \"- Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access - U.S.\"\n\n## Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights\n\n## Overview\n\nIntellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products, product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, as discussed below, for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.\n\nThe patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent), particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., major European countries, and Japan. These patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications, usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the Discovery Phase of the drug discovery process, which is described in the \"Research and Development\" section below. In general, national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:\n\n- Patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n- Patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to U.S. patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the FDA. To make up for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the FDA review process, a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration. Patent term restoration is limited by a formula and cannot be calculated until product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There is a five-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration for patents claiming inventions subject to a local review by a regulatory agency. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval). Also, in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, patent terms can be extended up to five years, depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors.",

          "chunk_text": "Moreover, the negotiating power of health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation, regulatory, and other market impacts, and they, along with gov ernments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion, or fav orable formulary placement. Such stakeholders hav e also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to limit access to our products. As these practices expand, including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. priv ate third-party payers, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitiv e and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\nPharmacy benefit manager practices hav e come under increased scrutiny from U.S. policymakers at the federal and state lev el who hav e proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact that these intermediaries hav e on drug pricing and patients' out of pocket costs. If promulgated, such legislation could hav e resultant implications, costs, or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see Item 1, \"Business-U.S. Priv ate Sector Dynamics\" and \"Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access-U.S.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\n- We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted, and in the future is likely to continue to result, in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products.\n\nIn the ordinary course of their lifecycles, our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S., as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S., after a specified period of time. For example, Trulicity will lose significant patent and remaining data protections in the next few years. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We hav e faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection.\n\nFor non-biologic products, loss of exclusiv ity typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and sev ere decline in rev enues, especially in the U.S. Generic pharmaceutical companies hav e in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation. For biologics, loss of exclusiv ity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor v ersions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including dev elopment timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approv al pathways.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often inv olv e complex legal, scientific and factual questions. There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found v alid and enforceable if challenged. Third parties may challenge, inv alidate, or circumv ent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not be deemed to infringe our patents. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes may not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternativ e processes or marketing alternativ e products or formulations that compete with our patented products. Patents held by third-parties hav e also contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all potential indications for a product candidate. In addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activ ities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property.

          "chunk_text": "Moreover, the negotiating power of health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation, regulatory, and other market impacts, and they, along with gov ernments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion, or fav orable formulary placement. Such stakeholders hav e also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to limit access to our products. As these practices expand, including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. priv ate third-party payers, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitiv e and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\nPharmacy benefit manager practices hav e come under increased scrutiny from U.S. policymakers at the federal and state lev el who hav e proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact that these intermediaries hav e on drug pricing and patients' out of pocket costs. If promulgated, such legislation could hav e resultant implications, costs, or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see Item 1, \"Business-U.S. Priv ate Sector Dynamics\" and \"Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access-U.S.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\n- We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted, and in the future is likely to continue to result, in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products.\n\nIn the ordinary course of their lifecycles, our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S., as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S., after a specified period of time. For example, Trulicity will lose significant patent and remaining data protections in the next few years. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We hav e faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection.\n\nFor non-biologic products, loss of exclusiv ity typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and sev ere decline in rev enues, especially in the U.S. Generic pharmaceutical companies hav e in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation. For biologics, loss of exclusiv ity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor v ersions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including dev elopment timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approv al pathways.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often inv olv e complex legal, scientific and factual questions. There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found v alid and enforceable if challenged. Third parties may challenge, inv alidate, or circumv ent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not be deemed to infringe our patents. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes may not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternativ e processes or marketing alternativ e products or formulations that compete with our patented products. Patents held by third-parties hav e also contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all potential indications for a product candidate. In addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activ ities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Executiv e Ov erv iew-Other Matters-Patent Matters\" and Item 1, \"Business-Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,\" for more details.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LLY acquired Prevail and its gene therapy PR001, which received Fast Track designation from the FDA for treating Parkinson\u2019s disease with GBA1 mutations and neuronopathic Gaucher disease. This designation was noted in the 2023 10-K filing, where LLY also disclosed the CVR structure tied to regulatory approval of a Prevail product by December 31, 2024. In 2023, LLY expanded its risk disclosures to emphasize the uncertainties and high failure rates in gene therapy development, including the potential reduction in CVR value if approval occurred after 2024. These disclosures reflect how the Fast Track designation introduced both accelerated development expectations and heightened regulatory risk, particularly for gene therapies like PR001, which are central to the CVR payout mechanism.",

(1)\n\n## Note 3: Acquisitions and Divestiture\n\nIn January 2021, February 2020 and 2019, we completed the acquisitions of Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail), Dermira, Inc. (Dermira) and Loxo Oncology, Inc. (Loxo), respectively. These transactions, as further discussed in this note below in Acquisitions of Businesses, were accounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has been recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\n\nWe also acquired assets in development in 2021, 2020, and 2019, which are further discussed in this note below in Asset Acquisitions. Upon each acquisition, the cost allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D was immediately expensed because the compound acquired had no alternative future use. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recorded acquired IPR&amp;D charges of $874.9 million, $660.4 million, and $239.6 million, respectively.\n\n## Acquisitions of Businesses\n\n## Prevail Acquisition\n\n## Overview of Transaction\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. To achieve the full value of the CVR, such regulatory approval must occur by December 31, 2024. If such regulatory approval occurs after December 31, 2024, the value of the CVR will be reduced by approximately 8.3 cents per month until December 1, 2028, at which point the CVR will expire without payment.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition establishes a new modality for drug discovery and development, extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets. The lead gene therapies in clinical development that we acquired were PR001 for patients with Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations and neuronopathic Gaucher disease and PR006 for patients with frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations. Both PR001 and PR006 were granted Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

      "question": "How did the IRA's Medicare Part D reforms affect CVS's ability to manage health care benefit costs and forecasting accuracy in 2024 compared to 2022, particularly in light of the new manufacturer discount obligations and catastrophic phase reinsurance shifts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS was subject to Medicare Part D regulations that included contract audits, beneficiary liability expansions, and uncertainty around cost recoupment mechanisms, which already complicated forecasting and cost management. By 2024, the IRA introduced significant changes to Medicare Part D, including capping beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and reducing Federal reinsurance in the catastrophic phase, which shifted more costs to Part D plans and manufacturers like CVS. These changes, combined with new manufacturer discount obligations and inflation-based rebates, increased the complexity of forecasting health care benefit costs. CVS's 2024 filings indicate that these regulatory shifts made it harder to accurately predict costs, especially given the fixed premium structure of their insured products (94% of Health Care Benefits segment revenues in 2024). The IRA's impact on cost structures and forecasting volatility represents a clear evolution from 2022, where the primary concern was regulatory uncertainty, to 2024, where the focus shifted to adapting to concrete policy-driven cost shifts and discount obligations.",

        "Hop 1: CVS(2022) \u2192 Medicare Part D: In 2022, CVS was subject to Medicare Part D regulations, including contract audits and liability risks, which introduced uncertainty into cost forecasting and benefit management.",
        "Hop 2: Medicare Part D \u2192 IRA: The IRA significantly redesigned Medicare Part D, introducing caps on out-of-pocket costs, reducing reinsurance in the catastrophic phase, and mandating manufacturer discounts, which directly altered the financial landscape for insurers.",
        "Hop 3: IRA \u2190 CVS(2024): By 2024, CVS faced increased forecasting challenges due to the IRA\u2019s cost-shifting provisions, with 94% of its Health Care Benefits segment revenues tied to fixed premiums that could not adjust to rising costs."

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act creates incentives for whistleblowers to speak directly to the government rather than utilizing internal compliance programs and reduces the burden of proof under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the 'FCPA'). There also are laws and regulations that set standards for the escheatment of funds to states.\n\nHealth savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending accounts and certain of the tax, fee and subsidy provisions of the ACA also are regulated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe Company also may be adversely affected by court and regulatory decisions that expand or revise the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or impose medical malpractice or bad faith liability. Federal and state courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, continue to consider cases, and federal and state regulators continue to issue regulations and interpretations, addressing bad faith liability for denial of medical claims, the scope of ERISA's fiduciary duty requirements, the scope of the False Claims Act and the pre-emptive effect of ERISA and Medicare Part D on state laws.\n\nContract Audits - The Company is subject to audits of many of its contracts, including its PBM client contracts, its PBM rebate contracts, its PBM network contracts, its contracts relating to Medicare Advantage and/or Medicare Part D, the agreements the Company's pharmacies enter into with other payors, its Medicaid contracts and its customer contracts. Because some of the Company's contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted with state or federal agencies, audits of these contracts are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs, including those which operate Medicaid fee for service plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare Part D plans or Medicare Advantage organizations.\n\nFederal Employee Health Benefits Program - The Company's subsidiaries contract with the Office of Personnel Management (the 'OPM') to provide managed health care services under the FEHB program in their service areas. These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program. In addition to other requirements, such as the Transparency in Coverage Rule note above, OPM regulations require that community-rated FEHB plans meet a FEHB program-specific minimum MLR by plan code and market. Managing to these rules is complicated by the simultaneous application of the minimum MLR standards and associated premium rebate requirements of the ACA. The Company also has a contractual arrangement with carriers for the FEHB program, such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal workers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the FEHB Act and as part of the FEHB program. Additionally, the Company manages certain FEHB plans on a 'cost-plus' basis. These arrangements subject the Company to certain aspects of the FEHB Act, and other federal regulations, such as the FEHB Acquisition Regulation, that otherwise would not be applicable to the Company. The OPM also is auditing the Company and its other contractors to, among other things, verify that plans meet their applicable FEHB programspecific MLR and the premiums established under the OPM's Insured contracts and costs allocated pursuant to the OPM's costbased contracts are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable FEHB program. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against the Company if it fails to comply with the FEHB program requirements.\n\nClinical Services Regulation - The Company provides clinical services to health plans, PBMs and providers for a variety of complex and common medical conditions, including arranging for certain members to participate in disease management programs. State laws regulate the practice of medicine, the practice of pharmacy, the practice of nursing and certain other clinical activities. Clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of clinical services must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice.\n\nThird Party Administration and Other State Licensure Laws - Many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations, such as PPOs, TPAs and companies that provide utilization review services. Several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs (also known as cash card or discount card programs).",

The Medicare price setting process for the first 10 drugs subject to Medicare price setting in Part D began in 2023 , which includes ENBREL, our product that currently generates considerable revenues. In 2024, CMS set a price for ENBREL under Medicare Part D that is significantly lower than currently applicable, beginning on January 1, 2026, which we expect will negatively impact its profitability in Medicare. See Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of operations-Product sales-ENBREL. In January 2025, CMS announced the next 15 drugs for Medicare price setting that will be applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, which includes Otezla. Depending on the growth and success of our medicines, other of our medicines may also be subject to selection by CMS in the next, or in a future, cycle of mandatory Medicare price setting. If other of our medicines are selected by CMS for Medicare price setting, we may be required to accept a price set by the government for Medicare similar to the process that was applied to ENBREL. Also under the IRA, Medicare Part D was redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance  will  be  reduced  in  the  catastrophic  phase  (resulting  in  a  shift  and  increase  of  such  costs  to  Part  D  plans  and  manufacturers,  including  by  requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs). Further, the IRA inflation penalties allows CMS to collect rebates from manufacturers if price increases outpace inflation. Such rebate obligations began to accrue October 1, 2022 for Medicare Part D and January 1, 2023 for Medicare Part B, but CMS has not yet issued invoices and has some discretion as to when to issue such invoices to manufacturers. We expect that several of our products will be subject to IRA inflation penalties, and several of our products have been on lists that are issued and updated on a quarterly basis by CMS under a related program under which Medicare beneficiaries are charged reduced coinsurance if price increases exceed inflation. The IRA's Medicare price setting and Medicare redesign are likely to have a material adverse effect on our sales, our business and our results of operations, and such impact is expected to increase through the end of the decade and will depend on factors including the extent of our portfolio's ex posure to Medicare reimbursement, the rate of inflation over time, the number of our products selected for Medicare price setting and the timing of market entry of generic or biosimilar competition. Further, following the enactment of the IRA, the environment remains dynamic and U.S. policymakers continue to demonstrate interest  in  health  care  and  drug  pricing  changes.  For  ex ample,  in April  2024,  CMS  finalized  policy  changes  that  will  give  Part  D  plans  more  flex ibility  to  substitute biosimilars for innovator products on formularies in 2025. Additionally, various government agencies have taken actions designed to reduce expenditures on prescription drugs. For example, HHS released a report with drug pricing proposals that seek to promote competition. The USPTO has also taken steps to strengthen coordination with the FDA to address perceived impediments to generic drug and biosimilar competition. Other CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can also significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed.\n\nWe also face risks related to the reporting of pricing data that affects reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.\n\n-Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, access to, and have affected, and may continue to affect, sales of our products\n\nAt the state level, legislation, government actions, and ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, PDABs, drug importation programs, reference pricing schemes, and other drug pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to report to the state proprietary pricing information or provide advance notice of certain price increases.\n\nStates are also enacting laws referencing the IRA and seeking to regulate and prohibit restrictions on the 340B Program. For example, following the passage of the IRA, bills have been proposed in multiple states that would apply the drug price caps set by HHS for Medicare to drug prices in an individual state, and such references to  IRA  price  caps  have  also  been  included  in  PDAB  legislation.  For  Medicaid  patients,  states  have  established  a  Medicaid  drug  spending  cap  (New  Y ork)  and implemented  a  new  review  and  supplemental  rebate  negotiation  process  (Massachusetts).  Eight  states  (Colorado,  Maine,  New  Hampshire,  New  Jersey,  Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish PDABs to identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and four such states include authority for the state PDABs to set upper payment limits on certain drugs for in-state patients, payers and providers. In 2024, no fewer than 17 states introduced PDAB legislation. The eight states with enacted PDAB laws are in various phases of implementation, with Colorado's PDAB being the furthest along. The Colorado PDAB deemed three of five drugs 'unaffordable,' including ENBREL, and are subject to rulemaking to establish an Upper Payment Limit (UPL) commencing March 2025 and that could be effective as soon as the fourth quarter of 2025. Further, inappropriate ex panded utilization of the 340B Program from broadened application of the 340B discounts has had, and is",

There can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.\n\nPremiums for our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which comprised 94% of our Health Care Benefits segment revenues for 2024, are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fix ed premium period, which is generally twelve months. These forecasts are typically developed several months before the fixed premium period begins, are influenced by historical data (and recent historical data in particular), are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends and changes in our members' behavior and health care utilization patterns and medical claim submission patterns and require a significant degree of judgment. For example, our revenue on Individual Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June of the year before the contract year. Cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we ex pect to incur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. During periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical costs trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic, accurately detecting, forecasting, managing, reserving and pricing for our (and our self-insured customers') medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging. There can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing, and whether our health care and other benefit costs will be affected by pandemics, disease outbreaks and other external events over which we have no control. Even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment's operating results.\n\nWhile the public health emergency related to COVID-19 expired in May 2023, COVID-19 still exists and it may, like many other respiratory viruses, wax and wane depending on geography and seasonality. The future impact COVID-19 will have on the Company and its ability to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs is uncertain, and will depend on geographies impacted, whether new variants emerge and their severity, the availability and costs of testing, vaccination and treatment, and legal and regulatory actions. COVID-19 may also impact provider behavior, utilization trends, membership, and overall economic conditions. These impacts could be adverse and material.\n\nA number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs, including previously uninsured members entering the health care system; Medicare members' utilization of supplemental benefits; other changes in members' behavior, health care utilization patterns and utilization management; turnover in our membership, health care provider and member fraud; additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, including changes to or as a result of the ACA and IRA; changes in the health status of our members; the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics; advances in medical technology; increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies); direct-to-consumer marketing by drug manufacturers; the increasing influence of social media on our members' health care utilization and other behaviors; the shift to a consumer-driven business model; changes in health care practices and general economic conditions (such as inflation and employment levels); increases in labor costs; pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks; influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we expected); clusters of high-cost cases; natural disasters and extreme weather events (which may increase in frequency or intensity as a result of climate change); and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control. For example, the length and severity of the influenza season can have an impact on health care and other benefit costs. In 2022-2023 influenza season had an earlier than average start, including as compared to the 2023-2024 influenza season; the 2020-2021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and the 2019-2020 influenza season maintained a high level of severity for a longer period of time than average. In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this issue.\n\nOur Health Care Benefits segment's operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results.",

      "answer": "In 2023, BMY had an exclusive right to commercialize Opdivo globally except in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, where Ono received royalties of 4% in North America and 15% elsewhere. By 2024, BMY and Ono were jointly promoting Orencia in Japan, with a co-promotion fee of 60% paid when a sale was made to the other party's assigned customer. Orencia generated $3.682 billion in 2024, up from $3.601 billion in 2023, reflecting a modest 2% growth. This suggests that the joint promotion strategy in Japan, supported by the co-promotion fee structure, contributed to a slight revenue increase despite the shared responsibilities and financial arrangements.",

However, after the fourth year, generic manufacturers could file Abbreviated New Drug Applications (aNDAs) with Paragraph IV certifications challenging listed patents. By 2024, BMY reported an increase in 'at-risk' generic launches and regulatory actions promoting biosimilar and generic approvals, which directly intensified patent litigation challenges.

          "chunk_text": "The U.S., EU and Japan each provide regulatory data protection, a period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic copy. In certain markets where patent protection  and  other  forms  of  market  exclusivity  may  have  expired,  regulatory  data  protection  can  be  of  particular  importance. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data protection exclusivity on the basis of the competitor's own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to  that  marketed  by  the  innovator. When  these  patent  rights  and  other  forms  of  exclusivity  expire  and  generic versions  of  a  medicine  are  approved  and  marketed,  there  are  often  substantial  and  rapid  declines  in  the  sales  of  the  original innovative product. For further discussion of the impact of generic competition on our business, refer to '-Competition' below.\n\nSpecific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity and data regulatory protection for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country. The following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product's patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the  innovator  may,  depending  on  a  number  of  factors,  apply  to  the  government  to  restore  lost  patent  term  by  extending  the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.\n\nA company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the  FDA.  If  the  innovative  pharmaceutical  is  a  chemical  product,  the  company  files  an  NDA.  If  the  medicine  is  a  biological product, a BLA is filed. Both types of applications can receive certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. An NDA or a BLA for a compound that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for an orphan drug indication. During this period, the FDA generally may not approve another application for the same drug product for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity. The type of application filed can affect regulatory data protection exclusivity rights as discussed below.\n\n## Chemical products\n\nA competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the U.S. must file an aNDA with the FDA. In the aNDA, the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only 'bioequivalence' between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The aNDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.\n\nAn innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an aNDA until after the innovator's listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an aNDA and allege that  one  or  more  of  the  patents  listed  in  the  Orange  Book  under  an  innovator's  NDA  is  invalid,  unenforceable,  or  will  not  be infringed  by  the  generic  product. This  allegation  is  commonly  known  as  a  Paragraph  IV  certification. The  innovator  then  must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, aNDAs including Paragraph IV certifications are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these aNDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.\n\nMedicines  approved  under  an  NDA  can  also  receive  several  types  of  regulatory  data  protection.  An  innovative  chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of regulatory data protection in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator's patent is challenged, as described above, a generic manufacturer may file its aNDA after the fourth year of the five-year regulatory data protection period. A pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an NDA, but is approved in, for example, a new formulation or a new route of administration, but not  for  the  drug  itself,  or  for  a  new  indication  on  the  basis  of  new  clinical  studies,  may  receive  three  years  of  regulatory  data protection for that formulation, route of administration, or indication.",

          "chunk_text": "## AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings.\n\nThird parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nAlthough most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.\n\nAbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced.\n\n## A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition.\n\nThird parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.\n\n## Any significant event that adversely affects Humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows.\n\nHumira accounted for approximately 37% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for Humira (as described further in 'The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings ' above), the commercialization of biosimilars of Humira, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of Humira for any reason.\n\n## AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline.\n\nTo remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care,",

          "chunk_text": "In some cases, manufacturers may seek regulatory approval by submitting their own clinical study data to obtain marketing approval or choose to launch a generic product 'at risk' before the expiration of the applicable patent(s) and/or before the final resolution of related patent litigation.  In addition, some countries are allowing manufacturers to manufacture and sell generic products, which negatively impacts the protections afforded the Company. Lower-priced generics or biosimilars for BMS biologic products or competing biologics could negatively impact our volumes and prices.\n\nIn addition, both the U.S. Congress and the FDA have taken steps to promote the development and approval of generic drugs and biosimilar biologics, including by providing generic and biosimilar developers a private right of action to obtain sufficient quantities of drug samples from the reference product' s manufacturer in order to conduct testing necessary to obtain approval for generic or biosimilar products.\n\nIn addition, in December 2023, the Biden administration released a proposed framework that for the first time proposed that a drug' s price can be a factor in determining that the drug is not accessible to the public and, therefore, that the government could exercise 'march-in rights' and license it to a third party to manufacture. W e cannot predict whether the Trump administration will finalize the draft framework or if the government will propose other drug pricing policy changes. If pursued and finalized, these policies could reduce prices and reimbursement for certain of our products and could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations .\n\nThere is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates disclosed in this 2024 Form 10K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance.\n\n## We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies and manufacturers and expect to see increasing market penetration of lower-priced generic products.\n\nThe future growth of BMS is dependent on the market access, uptake and expansion for marketed brands, new product introductions, new indications, product extensions and co-promotional activities with alliance partners. Competition is keen, and as we lose exclusivity for some of our marketed brands, lower-priced generic products will increasingly penetrate our markets. Generic or biosimilar challenges to our products can also arise at any time, and our patents may not prevent the emergence of generic or biosimilar competition for our products. In some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the U.S. or in the EU; political and social pressure has also pushed legislation and other measures that promote the use of generic and biosimilar products.  For additional information, see '-We could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected.'\n\nIn addition, we face competition from new products entering the market. New products may have (i) lower prices, (ii) superior efficacy (benefit) or safety (risk) profiles (whether actual or perceived), (iii) technological advantages that may make such products more convenient to use, (iv) better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, (v) more effective marketing programs and/or other differentiating factors that make it harder for our products to compete. W e cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those treated by our products and product candidates. Business combinations among our competitors and major third-party payers may also increase competition for our products. If we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors' products in the marketplace, this could have a material negative impact on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in our supply chain as well as in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.\n\nOur  product  supply  and  related  patient  access  has  been,  and  could  in  the  future  be,  negatively  impacted  by  difficulties,  delays  and  disruptions  in  the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Some of the difficulties, delays and disruptions include: (i) product seizures or recalls or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (ii) our failure, or the failure of any of our vendors or suppliers, to comply with cGMP and other applicable regulations or quality assurance  guidelines  that  could  lead  to  manufacturing  shutdowns,  product  shortages  or  delays  in  product  manufacturing;  (iii)  manufacturing,  quality assurance/quality control, supply problems or governmental approval delays; (iv) the failure of a supplier, including sole source or single source suppliers, to provide us with the necessary raw materials, supplies or finished goods within a reasonable timeframe and with required quality; (v) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with bulk active or finished product on time; (vi) construction or regulatory approval delays for new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for our biologics products; (vii) the failure to meet new and emerging regulations requiring products to be tracked throughout the distribution channels using unique identifiers to verify their authenticity in the supply chain; (viii) other manufacturing or distribution issues, including limits to manufacturing capacity and changes in the types of products produced, such as biologics, physical limitations, labor disputes  or  shortages,  or  other  business  interruptions;  (ix)  geopolitical  factors  in  a  specific  country  or  region,  including  any  new,  or  changes  in  or interpretations of existing, trade regulations, including for example, any new tariffs imposed in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or compliance requirements of  other  legislation; and (x) disruptions in supply chain continuity, including from market forces, natural disasters, global disease outbreaks or pandemics (including COVID-19), acts of war or terrorism or other unforeseeable or unavoidable events that materially impact one or more of our facilities or a critical supplier.",

      "question": "How did the IRA's Medicare Part D redesign impact BMY's rebate liabilities and financial reporting strategies between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BMY's revenues decreased by 2%, partly due to pricing pressures and regulatory changes introduced by the IRA, including the redesign of Medicare Part D and the introduction of inflation-based rebates. The IRA mandated a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries starting in 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for a percentage of the costs. This regulatory shift directly influenced BMY's financial planning and rebate accrual strategies. By 2024, BMY's gross-to-net (GTN) rebate accruals for Medicare Part D became a critical audit matter, as the company had to account for the complex rebate framework introduced by the IRA. The redesign of Medicare Part D required BMY to incorporate new assumptions and judgments into its GTN adjustments, including legal interpretations of the IRA, historical experience, payer channel mix, and processing time lags. These changes placed upward pressure on BMY's rebate liabilities and necessitated enhanced reporting and audit scrutiny, as evidenced by the inclusion of GTN U.S. rebate accruals as a critical audit matter in BMY's 2024 financial statements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BMY(2023) \u2192 IRA: In 2023, BMY's revenues declined by 2% due to the impact of the IRA, which introduced price negotiation mechanisms and inflation-based rebates for Medicare Part D and Part B drugs.",
        "Hop 2: IRA \u2192 Medicare Part D: The IRA significantly redesigned Medicare Part D, introducing a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries starting in 2025 and requiring manufacturers to pay rebates when prices increase faster than inflation.",
        "Hop 3: Medicare Part D \u2190 BMY(2024): In 2024, BMY's financial reporting reflected the impact of the IRA's Medicare Part D redesign, with GTN rebate accruals becoming a critical audit matter due to the complexity of rebate calculations and the need for updated assumptions and legal interpretations."

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive (loss)/income, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the  PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Gross-to-Net U.S. Rebate Accruals for U.S. Medicaid, Medicare Part D, and managed healthcare - Refer to 'Note 2. Revenue' to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs more fully disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company reduces gross product sales from list price at the time revenue is recognized for expected charge-backs, discounts, rebates, sales allowances and product returns, which are referred to as gross-to-net ('GTN') adjustments. These reductions are attributed to  various  commercial  arrangements,  managed  healthcare  organizations,  and  government  programs  containing  various  pricing  implications,  such  as  mandatory discounts, pricing protection below wholesaler list price or other discounts when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the coverage gap. Charge-backs and cash discounts are reflected as a reduction to receivables and settled through the issuance of credits to the customer. All other GTN adjustments are reflected as a liability and settled through cash payments.\n\nCertain of the GTN liabilities related to U.S. Medicaid, Medicare Part D, and managed healthcare organizations rebate programs (the 'GTN U.S. rebate accruals') involve  the  use  of  significant  assumptions  and  judgments  in  their  calculation.  These  significant  assumptions  and  judgments  include  consideration  of  legal interpretations  of  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  historical  ex perience,  payer  channel  mix ,  current  contract  prices,  unbilled  claims,  processing  time  lags,  and inventory levels in the distribution channel.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer committed $225 million to BioNTech, including a $75 million upfront payment and a $150 million equity investment, to co-develop an mRNA-based shingles vaccine. By 2023, this partnership evolved into a shared commercialization model where Pfizer gained global rights to the vaccine (excluding Germany, Turkey, and certain developing countries), and both companies agreed to share gross profits from its commercialization. Additionally, Pfizer held a 2.7% equity stake in BioNTech as of December 31, 2023, indicating a continued strategic alignment and financial stake in the success of the vaccine.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2022) \u2192 [BioNTech]: Pfizer paid $225 million, including a $75 million upfront payment and $150 million equity investment to BioNTech for the development of the mRNA Shingles Vaccine.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount primarily reflects $500 million of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. (a)\n\nThe decrease is primarily due to amortization, partially offset by the capitalization of the Comirnaty milestones described above. (b)\n\n## Developed Technology Rights\n\nDeveloped technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\n\n## Brands\n\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\n\n## IPR&amp;D\n\nIPR&amp;D assets represent R&amp;D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

      "question": "How did the expiration timeline for Trulicity's data protection in Europe and Japan in 2024 impact LLY's intellectual property strategy compared to 2023, particularly in light of the company's reliance on patent protection for revenue stability?",
      "answer": "In 2023, LLY's Trulicity had data protection in Europe expiring in 2024 and in Japan expiring in 2023, signaling imminent loss of exclusivity in those regions. By 2024, this expiration in Europe had occurred, increasing the risk of biosimilar competition and potential revenue erosion. LLY's intellectual property strategy, as outlined in 2024, emphasized reliance on remaining compound patents (U.S. 2027, Europe 2029, Japan 2029) and market dynamics to maintain exclusivity. However, with the loss of data protection in Europe, LLY faced increased exposure to generic competition, which directly threatened revenue stability, as noted in the 2024 10-K. This evolution shows a shift from a multi-layered protection approach in 2023 to a more defensive posture in 2024, focusing on patent enforcement and lifecycle management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2023) \u2192 Trulicity: LLY had Trulicity with data protection expiring in Europe (2024) and Japan (2023), with compound patents extending until 2027 (U.S.), 2029 (Europe), and 2029 (Japan).",
        "Hop 2: Trulicity \u2192 Patent Protection: Trulicity's data protection expiration in Europe and Japan created a higher risk of biosimilar entry, which directly affects LLY's revenue and market exclusivity.",
        "Hop 3: Patent Protection \u2190 LLY(2024): LLY acknowledged in 2024 that loss of exclusivity for products like Trulicity leads to rapid revenue decline, and the company emphasized reliance on remaining patents and market strategies to mitigate this risk."

          "chunk_text": "Moreover, the negotiating power of health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation, regulatory, and other market impacts, and they, along with gov ernments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion, or fav orable formulary placement. Such stakeholders hav e also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to limit access to our products. As these practices expand, including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. priv ate third-party payers, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitiv e and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\nPharmacy benefit manager practices hav e come under increased scrutiny from U.S. policymakers at the federal and state lev el who hav e proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact that these intermediaries hav e on drug pricing and patients' out of pocket costs. If promulgated, such legislation could hav e resultant implications, costs, or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see Item 1, \"Business-U.S. Priv ate Sector Dynamics\" and \"Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access-U.S.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\n- We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted, and in the future is likely to continue to result, in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products.\n\nIn the ordinary course of their lifecycles, our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S., as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S., after a specified period of time. For example, Trulicity will lose significant patent and remaining data protections in the next few years. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We hav e faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection.\n\nFor non-biologic products, loss of exclusiv ity typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and sev ere decline in rev enues, especially in the U.S. Generic pharmaceutical companies hav e in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation. For biologics, loss of exclusiv ity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor v ersions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including dev elopment timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approv al pathways.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often inv olv e complex legal, scientific and factual questions. There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found v alid and enforceable if challenged. Third parties may challenge, inv alidate, or circumv ent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not be deemed to infringe our patents. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes may not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternativ e processes or marketing alternativ e products or formulations that compete with our patented products.

Loss of effectiv e patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effectiv e market exclusiv ity for the product, often leading to a sev ere and rapid decline in rev enues for the product. We own, hav e applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products, product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, for some products we hav e effectiv e intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.\n\nThe patent protection generally anticipated to be of most relev ance to pharmaceuticals is prov ided by patents claiming the activ e ingredient (the compound patent) for our products, particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., major European countries, and Japan. In general, patents in each relev ant country last for a period of 20 years from their filing date, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:\n\n- Patent term adjustment is av ailable to all U.S. patent applicants to prov ide relief in the ev ent that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n- Patent term restoration for a single patent for a pharmaceutical product is prov ided to U.S. patent holders to compensate for a portion of the time inv ested in clinical trials and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rev iew process. There is a fiv e-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from initial FDA approv al. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are av ailable to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional fiv e years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approv al) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to fiv e years.\n\nIn some cases, the innov ator company may retain exclusiv ity despite approv al of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on v ersions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics and challenges, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be av ailable under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:\n\n- Data package protection generally prohibits regulatory approv al of other manufacturers' applications for marketing approv al if they rely on the innov ator company's regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period is generally fiv e years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA, subject to certain conditions), effectiv ely 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan, which can be extended to 10 years with qualifying pediatric studies. The period begins on the date of product approv al and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relev ant patents. Legislativ e bodies in the European Union (EU) are discussing proposed reductions in data protection periods but it remains uncertain if, or when, these proposals might be adopted.\n- In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approv ed drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusiv ity\" prov ides an additional six months of exclusiv ity, which is added to the term of data protection, orphan drug exclusiv ity and, for products other than biologics, pediatric exclusiv ity is also added to the term of any relev ant and non-expired patents.\n- A specific use of a drug or biologic can receiv e \"orphan\" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably expected to recov er dev elopment and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Orphan designation entitles a particular use of the drug to sev en years of market exclusiv ity, which runs in parallel with any applicable patents.\n\nOutside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiv eness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals v ary widely. International and U.S. free trade agreements like the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) administered by the World Trade Organization prov ide global protection of certain intellectual property rights. But in a number of markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receiv e for our products. Further, many dev eloping countries, and some dev eloped countries, do not prov ide effectiv e data package protection ev en though it is specified in the TRIPs Agreement.",

      "question": "How did TMO's classification of Fixed Income Funds shift from 2022 to 2023 in their pension plan disclosures, and what does this reveal about the application of valuation methodologies involving Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TMO reported $1,001 million in Fixed Income Funds for domestic pension plans and $510 million for non-U.S. pension plans, both categorized as 'Not subject to leveling.' By 2023, Fixed Income Funds in domestic plans dropped to $739 million and non-U.S. plans to $299 million, still categorized as 'Not subject to leveling.' However, in the broader fair value disclosures for 2023, Fixed Income Funds were reported at $6,663 million, with $6,437 million classified under Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2). This suggests that while TMO's pension plan disclosures continued to treat Fixed Income Funds as not subject to leveling, their overall fair value reporting shows increased reliance on Level 2 inputs for these assets, indicating a potential divergence or refinement in valuation methodologies across different reporting sections.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, MDT reported $73 million in short-term investments measured using Level 1 inputs, while in fiscal year 2023, this value increased to $80 million. This indicates a slight shift in MDT's short-term investment strategy, with a continued emphasis on investments that use Level 1 inputs, which are more liquid and transparent. The increase from $73 million to $80 million suggests a strategic decision to maintain or slightly grow exposure to highly liquid assets during this period.",

      "answer": "In 2023, LLY disclosed that Trulicity would lose significant patent and data protections in the coming years, exposing it to increased generic competition and revenue risk. By 2024, this risk materialized as Trulicity's U.S. revenue declined by 32%, driven by competitive dynamics and supply constraints. The expiration of data protection likely accelerated market entry from competitors, contributing directly to the volume drop and pricing pressures observed in 2024. This shows a clear temporal chain where the intellectual property risk identified in 2023 translated into financial performance impacts in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "Moreover, the negotiating power of health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation, regulatory, and other market impacts, and they, along with gov ernments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion, or fav orable formulary placement. Such stakeholders hav e also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to limit access to our products. As these practices expand, including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. priv ate third-party payers, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitiv e and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\nPharmacy benefit manager practices hav e come under increased scrutiny from U.S. policymakers at the federal and state lev el who hav e proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact that these intermediaries hav e on drug pricing and patients' out of pocket costs. If promulgated, such legislation could hav e resultant implications, costs, or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see Item 1, \"Business-U.S. Priv ate Sector Dynamics\" and \"Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access-U.S.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\n- We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted, and in the future is likely to continue to result, in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products.\n\nIn the ordinary course of their lifecycles, our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S., as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S., after a specified period of time. For example, Trulicity will lose significant patent and remaining data protections in the next few years. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We hav e faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection.\n\nFor non-biologic products, loss of exclusiv ity typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and sev ere decline in rev enues, especially in the U.S. Generic pharmaceutical companies hav e in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation. For biologics, loss of exclusiv ity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor v ersions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including dev elopment timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approv al pathways.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often inv olv e complex legal, scientific and factual questions. There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found v alid and enforceable if challenged. Third parties may challenge, inv alidate, or circumv ent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not be deemed to infringe our patents. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes may not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternativ e processes or marketing alternativ e products or formulations that compete with our patented products. Patents held by third-parties hav e also contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all potential indications for a product candidate. In addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activ ities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property.

      "answer": "In 2022, LLY reported $6,845.8 million in total sales rebate and discount accruals, a large portion of which were tied to Medicare-related sales. By 2024, LLY was directly impacted by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with Jardiance selected for government-set pricing in Medicare effective 2026, subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 list price. This reflects a shift from indirect pricing pressure through rebate accruals in 2022 to a direct, legislatively mandated pricing constraint in 2024. The evolution from contingent rebate liabilities to fixed, reduced pricing under the IRA indicates a significant intensification in LLY's exposure to pricing pressures, particularly in its Medicare-linked revenue streams.",

          "chunk_text": "## Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate accruals\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Net Product Revenue,\" the Company establishes provisions for sales rebate and discounts in the same period as the related sales occur. At December 31, 2021 the Company had $6,845.8 million in sales rebate and discount accruals. A large portion of these accruals are rebates associated with sales in the United States for which payment for purchase of the product is covered by Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare.\n\nAuditing the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate and discount liabilities is challenging because of the subjectivity of certain assumptions required to estimate the rebate liabilities. In calculating the appropriate accrual amount, the Company considers historical Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate payments by product as a percentage of their historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, the lag in payment timing, an evaluation of the current Medicaid and Medicare laws and interpretations, the percentage of products that are sold via Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare, and product pricing. For Medicaid, there is significant complexity associated with calculating the legislated Medicaid rebates. Management utilizes employees with legislative experience and knowledge in developing assumptions used to calculate Medicaid rebates. Similarly, for Managed Care and Medicare, given variability in prescription drug costs, continued historical year over year increases in enrollees and variability in prescription data, historical rebate information may not be predictive for management to estimate the rebate accrual and thus, management supplements its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon current utilization.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the identified risks of material misstatement related to the valuation of the sales rebate and discount liabilities. This included testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions used to calculate the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate liabilities, including the significant assumptions discussed above. This testing also included management's control to compare actual activity to forecasted activity and controls to ensure the data used to evaluate the significant assumptions was complete and accurate.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating for reasonableness the significant assumptions in light of economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. Our testing involved assessing the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performing analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. Additionally, our procedures included reviewing a sample of contracts, testing a sample of rebate payments and testing the underlying data used in management's evaluation. For Medicaid, we involved our professionals with an understanding of the statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company's calculation methodologies with the applicable government regulations and policy. For Medicare we evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions made by management in estimating the Medicare coverage gap liability.",

          "chunk_text": "Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.\n\nAbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\nCost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business-Regulation-Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing.\" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, European Union member states and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future.\n\nAbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, as well as federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, contribute to pricing pressures. In particular, the IRA will have the effect of reducing prices and reimbursements for certain of our products, which could significantly impact AbbVie's results of operations. Under the IRA, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services can effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices can apply as soon as nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. In August 2023, HHS, through the CMS, selected Imbruvica as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. In August 2024, the CMS published Medicare Part D prices that will be applicable to these medicines, including Imbruvica, beginning January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS, through the CMS, selected Vraylar and Linzess as two of the 15 medicines subject to government-set prices in Medicare Part D beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. In addition, beginning in January 2025, under the IRA, the 70% coverage gap discount program was replaced by a 10% manufacturer discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and i ncurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20% discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold under the new Part D benefit redesign. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. The IRA has and will continue to meaningfully impact AbbVie's business strategies and those of others in the pharmaceutical i ndustry. The full impact of the IRA on AbbVie's business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of our or a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nAbbVie continues to evaluate the impact that the IRA may have on the company. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries may result in additional pricing pressures.\n\nIn major markets worldwide, governments play a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries' pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in revenues and operating earnings.\n\nRebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n\n2024 Form 10-K |",

Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or div erted drugs sold under our brand name, which may also impact our business and financial results.\n\nIn addition, we rely on our ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled scientific, technical, management, and other personnel in order to compete effectiv ely. To continue to commercialize our products, and adv ance the research, dev elopment, and commercialization of additional modalities, indications, and product candidates, we hav e expanded, and will likely need to further expand, our workforce, both in and outside the U.S. We continue to face intense competition for qualified indiv iduals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic and other research institutions, as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities, which has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our failure to compete effectiv ely for talent could negativ ely affect sales of our current and any future approved products and indications, and could result in material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to our business.\n\n- Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation or business.\n\nPublic and priv ate payers continue to take aggressiv e steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medicines. These pressures hav e negativ ely affected, and we expect will continue to negativ ely affect, our consolidated results of operations. Gov ernments and priv ate payers worldwide hav e intensified their scrutiny of, and actions intended to address, pricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical products and are demanding greater commercial and clinical v alue from pharmaceutical companies in the form of strong product differentiation and demonstrated v alue. We continue to experience scrutiny on the pricing of current and potential diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease products due to payer concern ov er projected growth in these markets and, for certain of these drugs, the anticipated duration of treatment. We hav e also observ ed scrutiny of pricing and access disparities across jurisdictions.\n\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including because of the regulatory priorities of the U.S. executiv e branch and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, in August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices in Medicare effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the gov ernment-set prices for these first ten medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. Within the U.S., state lev el transparency initiativ es, importation rules, reporting requirements, and mandated programs, including the establishment of drug affordability boards with the power to set upper payment limits on certain drugs in state-regulated plans, hav e also increased administrativ e costs, in some cases, compromised confidential business practices and otherwise detrimentally impacted our business. Certain states hav e also undertaken efforts to codify 340B contract pharmacies into statute or impose other state law mandates, which increase the cost of 340B programs. To date, sev eral states hav e passed contract pharmacy legislation, which hav e been subject to v arious legal challenges. For more details, see Item 1, \"Business-Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access.\"\n\nFurther, restrictiv e or unfav orable pricing, cov erage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by gov ernments, regulatory agencies, courts, or priv ate payers, including in relation to the implementation of the IRA, reference pricing, and compulsory licensing, may adversely impact our business and financial results. We continue to experience additional pricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting from periods of unev en economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Merck disclosed its collaboration with Eisai on Lenvima, specifically highlighting its use in combination with Keytruda for treating endometrial and renal cell cancers. This partnership laid the groundwork for expanded clinical exploration in 2023, where Merck entered into a profit-sharing collaboration with Moderna to evaluate V940 (mRNA-4157) in combination with Keytruda in Phase 3 trials, resulting in a $250 million upfront payment and shared development costs. The earlier Lenvima-Keytruda combination strategy in 2022 likely informed Merck's approach to co-developing new combination regimens in 2023, reflecting a strategic shift toward broader immuno-oncology partnerships and shared-risk clinical development models.",

(2)\n\n## Pharmaceutical\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. Human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. Certain of the products within the Company's franchises are as follows:\n\n## Oncology\n\nKeytruda (pembrolizumab), the Company's anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment  of  certain  patients  with  cervical  cancer,  classical  Hodgkin  Lymphoma  (cHL),  cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinoma (cSCC),  esophageal  or  gastroesophageal  junction  (GEJ)  carcinoma,  head  and  neck  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (HNSCC), hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC),  non-small-cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC),  melanoma,  Merkel  cell  carcinoma,  microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancer (solid tumors), including MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) cancer (solid tumors), and urothelial carcinoma, including non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Keytruda is also approved for the treatment of certain patients in  combination with chemotherapy for metastatic squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, in combination with chemotherapy for HNSCC, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, in combination with platinum-and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for  esophageal  or  GEJ  carcinoma,  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  with  or  without  bevacizumab,  for  cervical  cancer,  in combination with chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in combination with axitinib for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and in combination with lenvatinib for endometrial carcinoma or RCC. Keytruda is  also  approved for certain patients with high-risk early-stage TNBC in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery. Keytruda is also approved as a monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients  with  RCC.  In  addition,  the  Company  recognizes  alliance  revenue  related  to  sales  of  Lynparza  (olaparib),  an  oral  poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, for certain  types  of  advanced  ovarian,  breast,  pancreatic,  and  prostate  cancers;  and Lenvima (lenvatinib) for certain types of",

(1)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nDuring 2021, Merck delivered on its strategic priorities by executing commercially to drive strong revenue and earnings growth  in  the  year,  completing  key  business  development  transactions,  accelerating  its  broad  pipeline,  and  achieving  notable regulatory milestones. Also, on June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of Organon. The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off.\n\nWorldwide sales were $48.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 17% compared with 2020, or 16% excluding the favorable effect of foreign exchange. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care and animal health. Additionally,  revenue  in  2021  reflects  the  benefit  of  sales  of  molnupiravir,  an  investigational  oral  antiviral  COVID-19 treatment. As discussed below, COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected sales in 2021, but to a lesser extent than in 2020, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.\n\nMerck continues to execute scientifically  compelling  business  development  opportunities  to  augment  its  pipeline.  In November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company evaluating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins through the development of pulmonary and hematologic therapies. In April  2021,  Merck  acquired  Pandion Therapeutics,  Inc.  (Pandion),  a  clinical-stage  biotechnology  company  developing  novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, Merck entered into a collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV.\n\nIn  2021,  Merck  received  over  30  approvals  and  filed  over  20  New  Drug  Applications  (NDAs)  and  supplemental Biologics License Applications (BLAs) across the U.S., the EU, Japan and China. During 2021, the Company received numerous regulatory approvals within oncology. Keytruda received approval for additional indications in the U.S. and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of breast, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, esophageal, melanoma and renal cell cancers, as  well  as  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  the  therapeutic  areas  of  breast,  cervical,  gastric  or  gastroesophageal  junction cancers. Keytruda was also approved in combination with Lenvima both for the treatment of certain adult patients with endometrial cancer  and  for  the  treatment  of  renal  cell  cancer.  Lenvima  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  Eisai  Co.,  Ltd.  (Eisai). Lynparza,  which  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  AstraZeneca  PLC  (AstraZeneca),  received  approval  in  China  as monotherapy for the treatment of certain adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Welireg (belzutifan), an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)",

This ongoing royalty arrangement with Ono for Tecentriq was part of a broader strategic relationship that continued into 2024, as evidenced by BMY's collaboration with Ono on multiple immuno-oncology programs including OPDIVO, YERVOY, and others. In contrast, many of BMY\u2019s other 2024 development partnerships were with newer collaborators such as Zai Lab, Prothena, and Exscientia, suggesting a dual strategy of maintaining core alliances like the one with Ono while expanding into new therapeutic areas and modalities with emerging partners.",

      "question": "How did the decline in AMGN's Aranesp sales in 2023 due to biosimilar competition influence the company's exposure to biosimilars in 2024, particularly in terms of competitive risk and revenue impact?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMGN's Aranesp sales declined globally due to lower net selling prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, with U.S. sales dropping further as dialysis organizations transitioned to biosimilars like EPOGEN. This trend was expected to continue, impacting both volume and pricing. By 2024, AMGN acknowledged increasing competitive pressure from biosimilars and generics, noting that such competition could significantly reduce revenues, as seen previously with Sensipar after its patent expiration. Thus, the 2023 decline in Aranesp sales foreshadowed a broader competitive risk in 2024, where biosimilars were identified as a growing threat to revenue stability and market share.",

Merck  also incurred royalty expenses amounting to $2.4 billion in 2021 under patent and know-how licenses it holds.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe Company's business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for existing products through a  strong  research  and  development  program.  At  December  31,  2021,  approximately  17,500  people  were  employed  in  the Company's research  activities. The  Company  prioritizes  its  research  and  development  efforts  and  focuses  on  candidates  that  it believes represent breakthrough science that will make a difference for patients and payers.\n\nThe  Company  maintains  a  number  of  long-term  exploratory  and  fundamental  research  programs  in  biology  and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. The Company's research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the Company's research and development resources  on  candidates  the  Company  believes  are  capable  of  providing  unambiguous,  promotable  advantages  to  patients  and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. Merck  is  pursuing  emerging  product  opportunities  independent  of  therapeutic  area  or  modality  (small  molecule,  biologics  and vaccines) and is building its biologics capabilities. The Company is committed to ensuring that externally sourced programs remain an important component of its pipeline strategy, with a focus on supplementing its internal research with a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies.\n\nThe  Company's  clinical  pipeline  includes  candidates  in  multiple  disease  areas,  including  cancer,  cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, neurosciences, respiratory diseases, and vaccines.\n\nIn  the  development  of  human  health  products,  industry  practice  and  government  regulations  in  the  U.S.  and  most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through pre-clinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug or vaccine may be marketed in the U.S., recorded data on pre-clinical and clinical experience are included in the New Drug Application (NDA) for a drug or the Biologics License Application (BLA) for a vaccine or biologic submitted to the FDA for the required approval.\n\nOnce the Company's scientists discover a new small molecule compound or biologic that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition, the Company commences pre-clinical testing with that compound. Pre-clinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry, pharmacology, immunogenicity and toxicology. Pending acceptable pre-clinical  data,  the  Company  will  initiate  clinical  testing  in  accordance  with  established  regulatory  requirements. The  clinical testing  begins  with  Phase  1  studies,  which  are  designed  to  assess  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics,  and  preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans. If favorable, additional, larger Phase 2 studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population, define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects  that  could  limit  the  compound's  usefulness.  In  some  situations,  the  clinical  program  incorporates  adaptive  design methodology  to  use  accumulating  data  to  decide  how  to  modify  aspects  of  the  ongoing  clinical  study  as  it  continues,  without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. One type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a/2b trial design, a twostage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b dose-optimization finding stage. If data from the Phase 2 trials are satisfactory, the Company commences large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the compound's efficacy and safety. Another  type  of  adaptive  clinical  trial  is  an  adaptive  Phase  2/3  trial  design,  a  study  that  includes  an  interim  analysis  and  an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a Phase 2 study (e.g. multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial. An adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design reduces timelines by eliminating activities which would be required to start a separate  study.  Upon  completion  of  Phase  3  trials,  if  satisfactory,  the  Company  submits  regulatory  filings  with  the  appropriate regulatory  agencies  around  the  world  to  have  the  product  candidate  approved  for  marketing.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.",

(1)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nDuring 2021, Merck delivered on its strategic priorities by executing commercially to drive strong revenue and earnings growth  in  the  year,  completing  key  business  development  transactions,  accelerating  its  broad  pipeline,  and  achieving  notable regulatory milestones. Also, on June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of Organon. The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off.\n\nWorldwide sales were $48.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 17% compared with 2020, or 16% excluding the favorable effect of foreign exchange. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care and animal health. Additionally,  revenue  in  2021  reflects  the  benefit  of  sales  of  molnupiravir,  an  investigational  oral  antiviral  COVID-19 treatment. As discussed below, COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected sales in 2021, but to a lesser extent than in 2020, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.\n\nMerck continues to execute scientifically  compelling  business  development  opportunities  to  augment  its  pipeline.  In November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company evaluating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins through the development of pulmonary and hematologic therapies. In April  2021,  Merck  acquired  Pandion Therapeutics,  Inc.  (Pandion),  a  clinical-stage  biotechnology  company  developing  novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, Merck entered into a collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV.\n\nIn  2021,  Merck  received  over  30  approvals  and  filed  over  20  New  Drug  Applications  (NDAs)  and  supplemental Biologics License Applications (BLAs) across the U.S., the EU, Japan and China. During 2021, the Company received numerous regulatory approvals within oncology. Keytruda received approval for additional indications in the U.S. and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of breast, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, esophageal, melanoma and renal cell cancers, as  well  as  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  the  therapeutic  areas  of  breast,  cervical,  gastric  or  gastroesophageal  junction cancers. Keytruda was also approved in combination with Lenvima both for the treatment of certain adult patients with endometrial cancer  and  for  the  treatment  of  renal  cell  cancer.  Lenvima  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  Eisai  Co.,  Ltd.  (Eisai). Lynparza,  which  is  being  developed  in  collaboration  with  AstraZeneca  PLC  (AstraZeneca),  received  approval  in  China  as monotherapy for the treatment of certain adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Welireg (belzutifan), an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)",

      "question": "How did the changes in Gilead's collaboration terms with Merck from 2022 to 2023 impact Gilead's commercialization leadership in the Rest of World region for long-acting HIV injectable products?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead and Merck's agreement stipulated that Gilead would lead commercialization in the EU and Rest of World for long-acting injectable HIV products if approved. By 2023, the agreement remained structurally unchanged in terms of commercialization leadership, with Gilead still leading in the EU and Rest of World. However, the 2023 update clarified that the cost-sharing remained at 60% (Gilead) and 40% (Merck), and no revenues had yet been recognized under the agreement through December 31, 2023. This indicates that while the strategic framework for Gilead\u2019s leadership in the Rest of World remained consistent, the lack of revenue generation suggests no commercial launch had occurred by the end of 2023, implying no material shift in the practical execution of commercialization leadership.",

        "Hop 1: GILD(2022) \u2192 Merck: Gilead entered into a collaboration with Merck in 2022 to co-develop and co-commercialize long-acting HIV treatments, with Gilead leading in the EU and Rest of World for injectables.",
        "Hop 2: Merck \u2192 Rest of World: The agreement specified that Merck would lead commercialization in the U.S., while Gilead would lead in the EU and Rest of World for injectables.",
        "Hop 3: Rest of World \u2190 GILD(2023): In 2023, the agreement remained unchanged in structure, with no revenues recognized and no indication of a commercial launch, suggesting Gilead\u2019s leadership in the Rest of World had not yet translated into revenue generation."

          "chunk_text": "## Merck &amp; Co, Inc. ('Merck')\n\nOn March 13, 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting investigational treatments in HIV that combine Gilead's investigational capsid  inhibitor,  lenacapavir,  and  Merck's  investigational  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  translocation  inhibitor,  islatravir.  The collaboration will initially focus on long-acting oral and injectable formulations.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck will share global development and commercialization costs at 60% and 40%, respectively, across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, if approved, Gilead would lead commercialization in the United States, and Merck would lead commercialization in the European Union ('EU') and rest of the world. For long-acting injectable products, if approved, Merck would lead commercialization in the United States and Gilead would lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world. Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck would jointly promote  the  combination  products  in  the  United  States  and  certain  other  major  markets.  If  successful,  we  would  share  global product revenues with Merck equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-determined per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion in net product sales for the oral combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue would increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Upon passing $3.5 billion in net product sales for the injectable combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue will increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Reimbursements of research and development costs to or from Merck are recorded within Research and development expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  Expenses  recognized  under  the  agreement  were  not  material  for  the  year ended December 31, 2021. No revenues have been recognized under the agreement for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nWe will also have the option to license certain of Merck's investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination with lenacapavir. Reciprocally, Merck will have the option to license certain of Gilead's investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination with islatravir. Each company may exercise its option for such investigational oral integrase inhibitor of the other company within the first five years after execution of the agreement, following completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial of that  integrase  inhibitor.  Upon  exercise  of  an  option,  the  companies  will  split  development  costs  and  revenues,  unless  the  nonexercising company decides to opt-out, in which case the non-exercising company will be paid a royalty.\n\nIn December 2021, Merck announced the decision of the parties to stop all dosing of participants in the Phase 2 clinical study evaluating  an  oral-weekly  combination  treatment  regimen  of  lenacapavir  and  islatravir  following  the  decision  of  FDA  to  place clinical holds on the investigational new drug applications for certain formulations of islatravir.\n\n## Arcus\n\nOn May 27, 2020, we entered into a transaction with Arcus, a publicly traded oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, which included entry into an option, license and collaboration agreement (the 'Collaboration Agreement') and a common stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement (together, and as subsequently amended the 'Stock Purchase Agreements'). In accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreements, which closed on July 13, 2020, we made an upfront payment of $175 million and acquired approximately 6.0 million shares of Arcus common stock for approximately $200  million.  Of  the  total  $391  million  initial  cash  payments,  including  transactional  costs,  made  under  the  agreements,  we recorded $135 million as an equity investment which was calculated based on Arcus' closing stock price on the closing date of the transaction. The remaining $256 million was attributed to (i) the acquired license and option rights of $175 million representing IPR&amp;D assets with no alternative future use, (ii) $65 million of an issuance premium for the equity purchase and (iii) $16 million of direct transactional costs. These amounts were expensed as Acquired in-process research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nUnder the Stock Purchase Agreements, we have the right to purchase additional shares of Arcus from Arcus over the five-year period beginning on the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreements, up to a maximum of 35% of the outstanding voting stock. We are subject to a three-year standstill, restricting our ability to acquire voting stock of Arcus exceeding more than 35% of the thenissued and outstanding voting stock of Arcus, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, we agreed not to dispose of any equity securities of Arcus prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreements without the prior consent of Arcus, subject to certain exceptions. On May 29, 2020, in a separate secondary equity offering, we acquired 2.2 million shares of common stock of Arcus for approximately $61 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we also acquired approximately 5.7 million additional shares of Arcus common stock for $220 million. As a result, we currently own a total of 13.8 million shares of Arcus, which represented approximately 19.5% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of Arcus immediately following the closing of the first quarter 2021 transaction.",

      "question": "How did the change in Gilead's revenue share from Symtuza between 2022 and 2023 reflect the evolving dynamics of their collaboration with Janssen, particularly in terms of revenue recognition and control over product sales?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead disclosed that it receives a revenue share from Janssen for components of Symtuza and includes this revenue in Product sales. By 2023, the collaboration terms clarified that Gilead recognizes its share of Symtuza revenue in the period when Janssen\u2019s sales occur, primarily because Gilead supplies the Gilead Compounds. This shift indicates a more defined and supply-driven revenue recognition model, aligning with the ongoing commercialization control retained by Janssen, while Gilead's role centers on intellectual property and supply chain contributions.",

          "chunk_text": "For information about our revenue-generating products, including the amount of revenue contributed by the products listed above, see Note 2. Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Revenue Share and Other Revenues\n\nWe also generate revenues from other activities, including revenue share from combination products, royalties for outbound licenses of our intellectual property and other payments received from our collaborations with third-party partners. For example, pursuant to our collaboration with Janssen, we receive revenue share from cobicistat, emtricitabine and TAF that are components of Symtuza (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/TAF), a fixed-dose combination product commercialized by Janssen. We include our revenue share from Symtuza in our Product sales. For a description of our collaborations with Janssen and other partners, see Note 11. Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Commercialization and Distribution\n\nWe have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in more than 35 countries. Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial  teams  promote  our  products  through  direct  field  contact  with  physicians,  hospitals,  clinics  and  other  healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts between the distributor and Gilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the United States exclusively through the wholesale channel. During the year ended  December  31,  2021,  approximately  91%  of  our  product  sales  in  the  United  States  and  approximately  65%  of  our  total worldwide  revenues  were  to  three  large  wholesalers,  AmerisourceBergen  Corporation,  Cardinal  Health,  Inc.  and  McKesson Corporation. We sell and distribute our products in Europe and countries outside the United States where the product is approved, either through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe  operate  in  a  highly  competitive  environment.  We  face  significant  competition  from  global  pharmaceutical  and biotechnology  companies,  specialized  pharmaceutical  firms  and  generic  drug  manufacturers.  Our  products  compete  with  other commercially available products based primarily on efficacy, safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease  of  use,  price,  insurance  and  other  reimbursement  coverage,  distribution  and  marketing.  As  our  products  mature,  pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices. Further, as new branded or generic products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur research and development ('R&amp;D') mission is to discover and develop transformational therapies in areas of high unmet medical need. Our product development efforts are focused primarily in viral diseases, inflammatory diseases and oncology. Our team of research scientists is engaged in the discovery and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to the approval of innovative medicines and therapies that will advance the current standard of care and address unmet medical needs. We intend to continue committing significant resources to internal R&amp;D opportunities and external business development activity to drive innovation and growth of our business.\n\nThe  development  of  product  candidates  and  investigational  therapies  in  our  pipeline  is  subject  to  various  risks  and uncertainties. These  risks  and  uncertainties  include  our  ability  to  enroll  patients  in  clinical  trials,  the  possibility  of  unfavorable results  of  our  clinical  trials,  the  need  to  modify  or  delay  our  clinical  trials,  including  on  account  of  clinical  holds  placed  by regulatory authorities, or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain regulatory approvals. As a result, our product candidates  and  investigational  therapies  may  never  be  successfully  commercialized.  Drug  development  is  inherently  risky,  and many product candidates and investigational therapies fail during the development process.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to invest in and advance our R&amp;D pipeline across our therapeutic areas. Below is a summary of our product candidates that were in Phase 3 or registrational Phase 2 clinical trials or pending marketing authorization review by FDA or European Medicines Agency ('EMA') as of the end of 2021.",

      "question": "How did extending the Red Oak sourcing agreement with Cardinal Health through 2029 affect CVS's reliance on joint generic pharmaceutical sourcing in 2023?",
      "answer": "The extension of the Red Oak sourcing agreement through 2029 reinforced CVS's continued reliance on the joint generic pharmaceutical sourcing arrangement with Cardinal Health in 2023. In 2022, the agreement was extended from a 10-year term to a 15-year term, indicating a long-term strategic commitment to the sourcing model. In 2023, the structure of the arrangement remained unchanged\u2014CVS and Cardinal each maintained 50% ownership in Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, and continued to use the entity to negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies. Notably, Red Oak still did not hold inventory on behalf of either company, and both parties continued to rely on the joint sourcing expertise provided through the venture. This continuity suggests that the extension solidified CVS\u2019s dependency on the shared sourcing model as a core part of its supply chain strategy for generic drugs, with no alternative sourcing arrangements mentioned in either year\u2019s filings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVS(2022) \u2192 Cardinal Health, Inc.: CVS extended its joint venture with Cardinal Health in 2022, extending the Red Oak Sourcing agreement from 10 to 15 years, with quarterly payments to be made through June 2029.",
        "Hop 2: Cardinal Health, Inc. \u2192 Generic Pharmaceuticals: The Red Oak Sourcing joint venture was specifically created to source and negotiate supply contracts for generic pharmaceuticals on behalf of both companies.",
        "Hop 3: Generic Pharmaceuticals \u2190 CVS(2023): In 2023, CVS continued to rely on Red Oak for generic pharmaceutical sourcing, maintaining the same 50/50 ownership and operational structure with no changes to inventory handling or sourcing strategy."

          "chunk_text": "## Shares Held in Trust\n\nThe Company maintains grantor trusts, which held approximately one million shares of its common stock at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. These shares are designated for use under various employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nThe Company has investments in (i) a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity, (ii) certain hedge fund and private equity investments and (iii) certain real estate partnerships that are considered VIEs. The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it may voluntarily contribute funds. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers several factors, including whether the Company has (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities - Primary Beneficiary\n\nIn 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. ('Cardinal') established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ('Red Oak'), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own 50%. The Red Oak arrangement had an initial term of ten years. In 2021, the Red Oak arrangement was amended to extend the initial term an additional five years, for a total term of 15 years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak by either company, and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\nCardinal is required to pay the Company quarterly payments, which began in October 2014 and will extend through June 2029. As milestones are met, the quarterly payments increase. The Company received $183 million from Cardinal during each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The payments reduce the Company's carrying value of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold. Amounts reimbursed by Cardinal for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and amounts due to or due from Cardinal at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities - Other Variable Interest Holder\n\nThe Company has invested in certain VIEs for which it has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary, consisting of the following:\n\n- Hedge fund and private equity investments - The Company invests in hedge fund and private equity investments in order to generate investment returns for its investment portfolio supporting its insurance businesses.\n- Real estate partnerships - The Company invests in various real estate partnerships, including those that construct, own and manage low-income housing developments. For the low income housing development investments, substantially all of the projected benefits to the Company are from tax credits and other tax benefits.\n\nThe Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because the nature of the Company's involvement with the activities of these VIEs does not give the Company the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. The Company records the amount of its investment in these VIEs as long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes its share of each VIE's income or losses in net income (loss). The Company's maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is limited to its investment balances as disclosed below and the risk of recapture of previously recognized tax credits related to the real estate partnerships, which the Company does not consider significant.\n\nThe total amount of other variable interest holder VIE assets included in long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the structure and potential payout of performance units under Amgen's Amended 2009 Plan evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of maximum share issuance based on performance outcomes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen granted performance units under the Amended 2009 Plan with the potential to earn up to 200% of the target units based on performance outcomes over a three-year period. By 2024, this structure remained consistent, with performance units still allowing recipients to earn up to 200% of the target shares. However, the Amended 2009 Plan had terminated for future grants by 2024, and the fungible share-counting formula continued to apply, where each performance unit counted as 1.9 shares against the available pool. As of December 31, 2024, 1,516,669 shares were subject to outstanding performance units from 2022, 2023, and 2024, with the potential to increase to 200% of target shares if above-target performance was achieved. This reflects continuity in the performance-based incentive structure but a closure in the availability of new grants under the plan.",

The  performance  goals  for  the  units  granted  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  which  are accounted for as equity awards, are based on (i) Amgen's stockholder return compared with a comparator group of companies, which are  considered market conditions and are therefore reflected in the grant date fair values of the units, and (ii) Amgen's stand-alone financial  performance  measures,  which  are  considered  performance  conditions. The  expense  recognized  for  awards  is  based  on  the grant  date  fair  value  of  a  unit  multiplied  by  the  number  of  units  expected  to  be  earned  with  respect  to  the  related  performance conditions,  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  Depending  on  the  outcome  of  these  performance  goals,  a  recipient  may  ultimately  earn  a number of units greater or less than the number of units granted. Shares of our common stock are issued on a one-for-one basis for each performance  unit  earned.  In  general,  performance  unit  awards  vest  at  the  end  of  the  performance  period.  The  performance  award program provides for accelerated or continued vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the plan, including upon death, disability, a change in control and retirement of employees who meet certain service and/or age requirements. Performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are typically payable in shares only when and to the extent the underlying performance units vest and are issued to the recipient, including with respect to market and performance conditions that affect the number of performance units earned.\n\nWe use a payout simulation model to estimate the grant date fair value of performance units. The weighted-average assumptions used in the payout simulation model and the resulting weighted-average grant date fair values of performance units granted were as follows:\n\n",

In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each RSU, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share-counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance  units  granted  represent  target  performance,  and  the  max imum  number  of  units  that  could  be  earned  based  on  our  performance  is  200%  of  the performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024. (1)\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes (i) 5,909,018 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $225.84; (ii) 3,289,089 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs, including 198,925 related dividend equivalents; and (iii) 1,516,669 shares subject to outstanding 2022, 2023 and 2024 performance units, including 91,901 related dividend equivalents. The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2024, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares  that  could  be  issuable  in  the  event  that  above  target  performance  on  the  performance  goals  under  these  outstanding  performance  units  is  achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\nThis plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 100 shares issuable upon the settlement of deferred RSUs.

      "answer": "In 2023, Pfizer faced intensified competition from generic drug manufacturers, particularly in China due to the expansion of the QCE process and continuation of the VBP program, which led to price cuts and volume loss for some products. This competitive pressure was compounded by payors promoting generic drugs as cost-saving measures in Medicaid and other managed care programs. By 2024, Pfizer responded by emphasizing collaboration with payors to improve patient access and affordability, aligning with its broader strategic priorities to expand margins and achieve commercial excellence. The company's 2024 MD&A highlights its intent to work closely with payors to support access to reliable, affordable healthcare, indicating a strategic shift toward more proactive engagement with payors in response to ongoing pricing pressures and formulary restrictions.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## GENERAL\n\nThe following M D &amp;A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the am ounts and certainty of cash flows from  operations and from  outside sources, and is provided as a supplem ent to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statem ents and related notes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this F orm  10-K. D iscussions of 2022 item s and year-to-year com parisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this F orm  10-K can be found within M D &amp;A in our 2023 F orm  10-K.\n\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the im pact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can m ask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful inform ation to evaluate our results.\n\nI n the first quarter of 2024, we reclassified royalty incom e (substantially all of which is related to our Biopharm a segm ent) from Other (income)/deductions--net and began presenting Royalty revenues as a separate line item  within Total revenues in our consolidated statem ents of operations. P rior-period am ounts have been recast to conform  to the current presentation.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEG Y AND OUTLOOK\n\nFinancial Highlights --The following is a sum m ary of certain financial perform ance m etrics (in billions, except per share data):\n\n- ** For additional information regarding Adjusted diluted EPS (w hich is a non-GAAP financial measure), including reconciliations of certain GAAP Reported to non- GAAP Adjusted information, see the NonGAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Incom e section w ithin M D&amp;A.\n\nOur Business and Strategy --Pfizer I nc. is a research-based, global biopharm aceutical com pany. W e apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly im prove their lives. See the Item 1. Business--About Pfizer section. As a science-driven global biopharm aceutical com pany, we rem ain focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting our m arketed brands and deploying capital responsibly, with a focus on initiatives that can help contribute to our long-term  revenue and future growth. M ost of our revenues com e from  the m anufacture and sale of biopharm aceutical products. W e believe that our m edicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare providers and patients, and we continuously evaluate how we can best collaborate with patients, physicians and payors to support and expand patient access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. In addition, we continually seek to expand and broaden our product portfolio offerings through prioritized developm ent of our pipeline and business developm ent opportunities targeted at critical unm et patient needs. As a result, our com m ercial organizational structure and R &amp;D  operations are critical to the successful execution of our business strategy. O ur ability to fulfill our purpose, Breakthroughs that change patients' lives , rem ains a core focus and underscores our com m itm ent to addressing the needs of society to help sustain long-term  value creation for all stakeholders.\n\nOur 2025 key priorities are:\n\n1. Improve R&amp;D productivity w ith sharpened focus\n2. Expand margins and maximize operational efficiency\n3. Achieve commercial excellence in our key categories\n4.

      "question": "How did the change in Amgen's collaboration terms with Novartis in 2022 affect Aimovig's U.S. commercialization cost structure and royalty obligations in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen shared U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and paid Novartis royalties on Aimovig sales in the U.S., while Novartis also paid Amgen double-digit royalties on ex-U.S. sales. After the collaboration terms were amended effective January 1, 2022, Novartis no longer shared U.S. commercialization costs or paid milestones, and Amgen stopped paying U.S. royalties to Novartis. In 2023, Amgen independently managed U.S. commercialization and only received royalties from Novartis on ex-U.S. sales, while also recovering $42 million in net costs from Novartis for migraine products, down from $53 million in 2022. This reflects a shift in financial responsibility and revenue flow for Amgen in the U.S. market.",

In addition, we acquire product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&amp;D  capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product  base.  These arrangements  generally provide for nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees,  development  and  commercial-performance  milestone  payments,  cost  sharing,  royalty  payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\n\nTrade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we  generally  require  counterparties  to  execute  confidentiality  agreements  upon  commencement  of  a  business  relationship  with  us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\n\n## BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in early 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.\n\nIn addition, we jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene, which shares in global R&amp;D costs by providing cash  and  development  services  of  up  to  $1.25  billion.  Upon  regulatory  approval,  BeiGene  will  assume  commercialization  rights  in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.\n\n## Novartis\n\nWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig. On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Part IVNote 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arrangement through December 31, 2021\n\nIn the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal,  recognized  product  sales  of  Aimovig  in  the  United  States,  shared  U.S.  commercialization  costs  with  Novartis  and  paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis held global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&amp;D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to  make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States.\n\n## Arrangement after January 1, 2022\n\nPursuant  to  the  amendment  effective  January  1,  2022,  Novartis  retains  the  ex-U.S.  Novartis  Rights  and  will  continue  to  pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig. Amgen and Novartis will continue to share development expenses worldwide.\n\nAmgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig worldwide.",

Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside China, Amgen will also pay royalties to BeiGene.\n\n## Novartis\n\nWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig. On January 31, 2022, concurrent with the settlement of the previously disclosed litigation between Amgen and Novartis we modified the terms of the collaboration. See Part IVNote 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arrangement through December 31, 2021\n\nIn the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly developed and collaborated on the commercialization of Aimovig. Amgen, as the principal,  recognized  product  sales  of  Aimovig  in  the  United  States,  shared  U.S.  commercialization  costs  with  Novartis  and  paid Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis held global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig (the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights). Novartis paid Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories and funded a portion of global R&amp;D expenses. In addition, Novartis was required to  make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds were achieved with respect to Aimovig in the United States.\n\n## Arrangement after January 1, 2022\n\nPursuant  to  the  amendment  effective  January  1,  2022,  Novartis  retains  the  ex-U.S.  Novartis  Rights  and  will  continue  to  pay double-digit royalties on net sales in the ex-U.S. Novartis Rights territories. In the United States, Novartis will no longer collaborate with Amgen, share Aimovig commercialization costs or pay milestones and Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig. Amgen and Novartis will continue to share development expenses worldwide.\n\nAmgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig worldwide.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY shared promotional responsibilities for Orencia with Ono in Japan, paying a 60% co-promotion fee when sales were made to Ono's assigned customers. This model required active coordination in marketing and distribution, with BMY handling the intravenous formulation and Ono the subcutaneous version. By 2023, BMY transitioned to a royalty-based model for Opdivo, where Ono receives 15% royalties outside Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, indicating a shift from shared promotion to a more streamlined licensing structure. This change likely reduced operational complexity while maintaining revenue flow from Ono\u2019s local market expertise, suggesting a strategic pivot toward optimizing global commercialization efficiency while retaining financial exposure in key Asian markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Biologic products\n\nThe  U.S.  healthcare  legislation  enacted  in  2010  created  an  approval  pathway  for  biosimilar  versions  of  innovative  biological products  that  did  not  previously  exist.  Prior  to  that  time,  innovative  biologics  had  essentially  unlimited  regulatory  exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a 'biosimilar' version of the innovator product. However, although an  application  for  approval  of  a  biosimilar  version  may  be  filed  four  years  after  approval  of  the  innovator  product,  qualified innovative  biological  products  will  receive  12  years  of  regulatory  data  protection,  meaning  that  the  FDA  may  not  approve  a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism  for  innovators  to  enforce  the  patents  that  protect  innovative  biological  products  and  for  biosimilar  applicants  to challenge  the  patents.  Such  patent  litigation  may  begin  as  early  as  four  years  after  the  innovative  biological  product  is  first approved by the FDA.\n\nThe increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators' basic patents covering major  pharmaceutical  products.  Second,  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions  may  limit  the  ability  of  an  innovator  company  to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, among others, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based  solely  on  the  expiration  of  the  relevant  patent(s)  or  the  current  forms  of  regulatory  exclusivity.  Our  marketed  biologic products include Opdivo , Yervoy , Orencia, Reblozyl and Empliciti .\n\n## European Union\n\nPatents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe  primary  route  we  use  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  of  pharmaceutical  products  in  the  EU  is  through  the  'centralized procedure.' This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and  is  also  available  for  certain  new  chemical  compounds  and  products.  A  company  seeking  to  market  an  innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies  the  MAA. It  is  also  possible  for  new  chemical  products  to  obtain  marketing  authorization  in  the  EU  through  a  'mutual recognition  procedure,'  in  which  an  application  is  made  to  a  single  member  state,  and  if  the  member  state  approves  the pharmaceutical  product  under  a  national  procedure,  then  the  applicant  may  submit  that  approval  to  the  mutual  recognition procedure of some or all other member states.\n\nAfter  obtaining  marketing  authorization  approval,  a  company  must  obtain  pricing  and  reimbursement  for  the  pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.\n\nThroughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an '8+2+1' regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator.  The  possible  extension  to  11  years  is  available  if  the  innovator,  during  the  first  eight  years  of  the  marketing authorization,  obtains  an  additional  indication  that  is  of  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  treatments.  For products  that  were  filed  prior  to  October/November  2005,  there  is  a  10-year  period  of  regulatory  data  protection  under  the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.\n\nIn  general,  EU  law  treats  chemically-synthesized  drugs  and  biologically-derived  drugs  the  same  with  respect  to  intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has  issued  guidelines  that  outline  the  additional  information  to  be  provided  for  biosimilar  products,  also  known  as  generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Tecentriq was identified as a product with a shared trademark arrangement between BMY and Roche, indicating a collaborative positioning of the brand. By 2023, BMY's relationship with Tecentriq evolved into a structured royalty-sharing agreement with Ono, where Roche paid single-digit royalties on global Tecentriq sales, which were then split between BMY and Ono. This created a new revenue dependency for BMY through Ono, as BMY was now indirectly reliant on Ono\u2019s position in the Tecentriq royalty chain. Additionally, in 2023, BMY\u2019s existing dependency on Ono for Opdivo royalties (4% in North America and 15% elsewhere) was reinforced, further entrenching BMY\u2019s reliance on Ono for oncology product revenue.

Intangible assets included $640 million of definite-lived Acquired marketed product rights ( Krazati ) and $3.5 billion of indefinite-lived IPRD assets. The estimated fair value of both definite-lived Acquired marketed product rights and indefinite-lived IPRD assets was determined using an income approach valuation method. Goodwill resulted primarily from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe results of operations and cash flows for Karuna, RayzeBio and Mirati were included in the consolidated financial statements commencing on their respective acquisition dates and were not material. Historical financial results of the acquired entities were not significant.\n\n## Orum\n\nIn 2023, BMS acquired the rights to Orum's ORM-6151 program, which is currently in Phase I clinical development. ORM-6151 is an anti-CD33 antibody-enabled GSPT1 degrader for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. The consideration included an upfront payment of $100 million, as well as contingent development milestone payments up to $80 million. The upfront payment was expensed to Acquired IPRD.\n\n## Turning Point\n\nIn 2022, BMS acquired Turning Point for $4.1 billion of cash or $3.3 billion net of cash acquired. Turning Point was a clinical-stage precision oncology company with a pipeline of investigational medicines designed to target the common mutations and alterations that drive cancer growth. The acquisition provided BMS rights to Turning Point's lead asset, repotrectinib, and other clinical and pre-clinical stage assets. Repotrectinib was approved by the FDA in November 2023 and is marketed under the brand name Augtyro.\n\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination in which all assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.\n\nThe results of Turning Point's operations were included in the consolidated financial statements commencing August 18, 2022, and were not material. Historical financial results of the acquired entity were not significant.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nThe following table summarizes the financial impact of divestitures including royalty income, which is included in Other (income)/expense, net. Revenue and pretax earnings related to all divestitures were not material in all periods presented (ex cluding divestiture gains or losses).\n\n",

      "question": "How did GILD's revenue recognition model for Symtuza change from 2023 to 2024 under its partnership with Janssen, and what does this indicate about GILD's evolving role in the commercialization of the product?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GILD recognized its share of Symtuza revenue based on the net selling prices of the Gilead Compounds supplied to Janssen, with revenue recognized in the period corresponding to Janssen's sales. By 2024, the structure remained largely unchanged in terms of revenue recognition timing, but the continued emphasis on GILD's exclusive supply of the Gilead Compounds and licensing to Janssen indicates a stable but passive role for GILD in the commercialization chain. This suggests that GILD's strategic focus has remained on supplying key components rather than direct commercialization of Symtuza.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GILD(2023) \u2192 Janssen: GILD recognized Symtuza revenue based on Janssen's sales and the ratio of net selling prices of the Gilead Compounds, with revenue recorded as Product Sales.",
        "Hop 2: Janssen \u2192 Symtuza: Janssen was responsible for manufacturing, registration, distribution, and commercialization of Symtuza globally, while GILD supplied the Gilead Compounds.",
        "Hop 3: Symtuza \u2190 GILD(2024): GILD continued to supply the Gilead Compounds and retained intellectual property rights, but had no direct role in Symtuza\u2019s commercialization, mirroring the 2023 arrangement."

At the time of separation, should it occur, G alapagos' and our rights and responsibilities under the OLCA would transfer to SpinCo, and G alapagos would gain full global development and commercialization rights to its pipeline, subject to payment of single digit royalties to G ilead on net sales of certain products. This separation is expected to occur by mid-2025. With respect to G ilead's ownership stake in G alapagos, upon separation, G ilead will hold approximately 25% of the outstanding shares in both G alapagos and SpinCo and will be subject to a lock-up of G alapagos shares through March 2027 and of SpinCo shares until six months after the separation, subject to certain customary exceptions and early termination provisions. The two G ilead designees appointed to G alapagos' board of directors will step down upon the separation and Gilead will be entitled to nominate two directors to SpinCo's board.\n\n## Janssen\n\n## Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey\n\nIn  2009,  we  entered  into  a  license  and  collaboration  agreement  with  Janssen  to  develop  and  commercialize  a  fix ed-dose  combination  of  our  Truvada  and Janssen's non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, rilpivirine. This combination was approved in the U.S. and EU in 2011, and is sold under the brand name Complera in the U.S. and Eviplera in the EU. The agreement was amended in 2014 to expand the collaboration to include another product containing Janssen's rilpivirine and our emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide ('Odefsey').\n\nUnder the amended agreement, Janssen granted us an exclusive license to Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey worldwide, but retained rights to distribute both combination products in certain countries outside of the U.S. Neither party is restricted from combining its drugs with any other drug products except those which are similar to the components of Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey.\n\nWe are responsible for manufacturing Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey and have the lead role in registration, distribution and commercialization of both products except in the countries where Janssen distributes. Janssen has exercised a right to co-detail the combination product in some of the countries where we are the selling party.\n\nUnder the financial provisions of the 2014 amendment, the selling party sets the price of the combined products and the parties share revenues based on the ratio of the net selling prices of the party's component(s), subject to certain restrictions and adjustments. We retain a specified percentage of Janssen's share of revenues, including up to 30% in major markets. Sales of these products are included in Product sales and Janssen's share of revenues is included in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cost of goods sold relating to Janssen's share was $403 million, $430 million and $483 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including withdrawal of a product from the market, material breach by either party or expiry of the revenue share payment term. We may terminate the agreement without cause with respect to the countries where we sell the products.\n\n## Symtuza\n\nIn 2014, we amended a license and collaboration agreement with Janssen to develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of Janssen's darunavir and our cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide ('G ilead Compounds'). This combination was approved in the U.S. and EU in July 2018 and September 2017, respectively, and is sold under the brand name Symtuza.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2014 amendment, we granted Janssen an exclusive license to Symtuza worldwide. Janssen is responsible for manufacturing, registration, distribution and commercialization of Symtuza worldwide. We are responsible for the intellectual property related to the G ilead Compounds and are the exclusive supplier  of  the  G ilead  Compounds.  Neither  party  is  restricted  from  combining  its  drugs  with  any  other  drug  products  ex cept  those  which  are  similar  to  the components of Symtuza.",

      "question": "How did the approaching STELARA patent expiration in 2023 influence JNJ's strategic emphasis on its IMBRUVICA collaboration with Pharmacyclics LLC in 2023, given the ongoing patent litigation partnership between Janssen Biotech and Pharmacyclics LLC?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of JNJ, held key patents for STELARA, with the U.S. composition of matter patent expiring in 2023. This impending expiration likely increased JNJ\u2019s urgency to diversify or strengthen its revenue-generating partnerships. In the same year, Janssen Biotech and Pharmacyclics LLC, a subsidiary of AbbVie, were co-plaintiffs in patent litigation concerning Imbruvica, indicating a strong collaborative relationship focused on protecting and extending product exclusivity. By 2023, JNJ explicitly highlighted IMBRUVICA as a key collaboration with Pharmacyclics LLC, suggesting a strategic shift toward reinforcing this partnership as STELARA\u2019s patent protection neared expiration in the U.S. This indicates that JNJ may have increased its strategic emphasis on IMBRUVICA to offset potential revenue losses from STELARA\u2019s future biosimilar competition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JNJ(2022) \u2192 Janssen Biotech, Inc.: JNJ\u2019s subsidiary held STELARA patents with U.S. expiration in 2023, a material product contributing 9.7% of fiscal 2021 revenue.",
        "Hop 2: Janssen Biotech, Inc. \u2192 Pharmacyclics LLC: In 2022, both entities were co-plaintiffs in Imbruvica patent litigation, showing a legal and strategic alignment.",
        "Hop 3: Pharmacyclics LLC \u2190 JNJ(2023): In 2023, JNJ explicitly named IMBRUVICA as a major collaboration with Pharmacyclics LLC, signaling increased strategic focus."

          "chunk_text": "claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, 'Legal Proceedings-Intellectual Property' of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nSales of the Company's largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.7% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA . The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent expires in 2024. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nSales of the Company's second largest product, collectively DARZALEX  (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 6.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO . \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.\n\n## Competition\n\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company's consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\n\n## Environment\n\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company's compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe Company's businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.\n\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company's subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\n\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical",

AbbVie Inc., et al. , in New Mexico District Court for Santa Fe County against AbbVie and other companies alleging their marketing of AndroGel violated New Mexico's Unfair Practices Act. In October 2020, the state added a claim under the New Mexico False Advertising Act.\n\n## Shareholder and Securities Litigation\n\nIn June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc. , was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. The court granted motions dismissing the claims of three investment-fund plaintiffs, which they appealed. In March 2021, in the first of those appeals, the dismissal was affirmed. One of these plaintiffs refiled its lawsuit in New York state court in June 2020 while the appeal of its dismissal in Illinois is pending. In November 2020, the New York Supreme Court for the County of New York dismissed that lawsuit, which is being appealed. In September 2021, the Illinois court granted AbbVie's motion for summary judgment against all remaining plaintiffs on all the remaining claims, dismissing them with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissals.\n\nIn October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al ., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class.\n\nLawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's textured breast implants. The lawsuits, which were filed by Allergan shareholders, have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as In re: Allergan plc Securities Litigation . The plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages and attorneys' fees. In September 2019, the court partially granted Allergan's motion to dismiss. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class.\n\nLawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's former Actavis generics unit and its alleged anticompetitive conduct with other generic drug companies. The lawsuits were filed by Allergan shareholders and consist of three purported class actions and one individual action that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey as In re: Allergan Generic Drug Pricing Securities Litigation . In July 2021, the parties reached an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits, which received court approval in November 2021.\n\n## Product Liability and General Litigation\n\nIn 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al. , was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator seeks damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit.\n\n## Intellectual Property Litigation\n\nAbbVie Inc. and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd are seeking to enforce their patent rights relating to adalimumab (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark Humira). In April 2021 and May 2021, cases were filed in the United States District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  Illinois  against Alvotech  hf. AbbVie  alleges  defendant's  proposed  biosimilar adalimumab product infringes certain AbbVie patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. In August 2021, the court  denied  Defendant's  motion  to  dismiss  on  jurisdictional  grounds  in  the  first  case;  a  motion  in  the  second  case remains  pending.  The  court  has  set  a  trial  on  a  subset  of  patents  for August  2022.  The  court  order  provides  that Alvotech will stay off the market until that decision. Litigation on the remaining patents is stayed. In October 2021, the May 2021 declaratory judgment action filed by Alvotech hf. and its U.S. subsidiary Alvotech USA, Inc. in the United States Eastern District of Virginia was transferred to the Northern District of Illinois and subsequently dismissed.\n\nPharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib tablets (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark Imbruvica). Cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2019 against Alvogen Pine Brook LLC and Natco Pharma Ltd.. In August 2021, the court issued a decision holding all asserted patents infringed and valid. The judgment precludes Defendants from obtaining regulatory approval and launching until the last patent expires in 2036. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of Imbruvica, is the co-plaintiff in these suits.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Merck introduced Keytruda as a core product, signaling its strategic importance in oncology collaborations, such as with AstraZeneca for combination therapies. By 2023, Keytruda was explicitly listed among Merck\u2019s key products, contributing to a significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue\u2014specifically, in aggregate with Gardasil/Gardasil 9, it represented 56% of total sales. However, the 2023 report also highlighted growing risk around Keytruda\u2019s impending U.S. market exclusivity loss in 2028, which could lead to a substantial decline in sales, similar to the experience with Bridion in the EU and Japan. This reflects a shift from strategic introduction to a heightened focus on risk mitigation as the product matures in the portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CVS announced the launch of Cordavis, a wholly owned subsidiary focused on commercializing and co-producing high-quality biosimilar products. This strategic move was aimed at expanding access to biosimilars in the U.S. and increasing competition to lower drug costs. By 2024, this initiative had evolved into a more formalized partnership model with pharmaceutical manufacturers, as evidenced by Cordavis's direct collaboration with these manufacturers to develop biosimilar portfolios. This shift directly supported CVS's broader cost-saving initiatives for clients, aligning with the company's goal to reduce healthcare costs through increased biosimilar adoption and market competition.",

          "chunk_text": "two programs administered by CMS, the Accountable Care Organization ('ACO') Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health ('REACH') Model (collectively, 'ACO REACH') and the Medicare Shared Savings Program ('MSSP'), under which the Company served a total of more than 1 million covered lives as of December 31, 2024.\n\nACOs are networks of healthcare providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. ACOs that achieve performance standards established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ('HHS') are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.\n\n## In-Home Health Evaluations\n\nAs a complement to its value-based care delivery, the Company operates a large mobile network of credentialed providers in the U.S. through its Signify Health business. These credentialed providers are deployed into the home primarily to conduct in-home health evaluations ('IHEs') and perform select diagnostic services. IHEs may also be performed virtually or at a healthcare provider facility. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company performed more than 3 million IHEs. While in the home, providers perform IHEs with the assistance of the Company's longitudinal patient records and proprietary clinical workflow software with its integrated device hub. The Company's software guides clinical workflows as well as in-home diagnostic screenings, yielding a rich patient report of hundreds of data points. The Company also offers diagnostic and preventive services and provides comprehensive medication review services while in the home. Through its IHEs, the Company creates a comprehensive, documented record of the clinical, social and behavioral needs of its health plan customers' medically complex populations and seek to further engage them with the healthcare system.\n\nThe evaluation results of IHEs are provided to individuals' primary care physicians. The Company believes sharing these results helps to fill gaps in care, while encouraging individuals who have not regularly visited their PCP to schedule a visit. The IHEs also provide health plans with insights into member health without taking members out of the home and contribute to health plans' ability to effectively participate in value-based and risk-adjusted government programs such as Medicare Advantage. The data gathered during an IHE is also a resource that can be used by health plans to improve their Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ('HEDIS') scores and Medicare Advantage star ratings.\n\n## MinuteClinic\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company operated more than 900 MinuteClinic locations in the U.S. The clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally established guidelines to deliver a variety of health care services. Payors value these clinics because they provide convenient, highquality, cost-effective care, in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more ex pensive sites of care. MinuteClinic also offers virtual care services to connect customers with licensed providers to provide access to health services remotely.
