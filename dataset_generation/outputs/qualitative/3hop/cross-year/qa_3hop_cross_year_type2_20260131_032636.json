      "question": "How did CVS's exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of fair value and unrealized losses, and what does this multi-year trajectory suggest about the company's risk positioning in this asset class?",
      "answer": "CVS's exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) decreased significantly over the three-year period. In 2022, the company held RMBS with a fair value of $629 million, including $10 million in unrealized losses. By 2023, the fair value of RMBS dropped to $614 million, but unrealized losses increased to $60 million, indicating a deterioration in the portfolio's market value. In 2024, CVS's RMBS holdings were reduced further to $71 million, a sharp decline from prior years, suggesting a strategic reduction in exposure. This trajectory reveals a deliberate de-risking strategy, moving away from RMBS amid rising unrealized losses and potentially volatile market conditions.",

      "answer": "CVS's Separate Accounts Assets decreased from $5,087 million in 2022 to $3,250 million in 2023, and slightly increased to $3,311 million in 2024. This represents a significant decline in 2023 followed by a marginal recovery in 2024, suggesting a strategic reduction or market-driven devaluation in long-term insurance-linked investments, followed by stabilization.",

      "question": "How did CVS's allocation to hedge fund limited partnership investments through pension plan assets change from 2022 to 2024, and what does this three-year trajectory suggest about the company's evolving pension fund strategy?",
      "answer": "CVS's allocation to hedge fund limited partnership investments was $214 million in 2022, remained relatively stable at $225 million in 2023, and then increased to $252 million in 2024. This represents a gradual upward trend, with a total increase of 17.8% over the three-year period. The steady or slightly growing allocation suggests that CVS maintained a consistent, and potentially more confident, strategic approach to including alternative investments in its pension fund portfolio over time.",

      "answer": "CVS's exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) declined significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company held $574 million in CMBS with $12 million in unrealized losses. By 2023, the fair value of CMBS dropped to $675 million, while unrealized losses increased to $100 million. In 2024, the CMBS holdings fell further to just $6 million with no significant unrealized losses reported.

      "answer": "CVS's investment in foreign securities showed a significant decline from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the fair value of foreign securities was $838 million, decreasing to $1,650 million in 2023, and then dropping sharply to $51 million in 2024. This trajectory indicates a strategic reduction in international market exposure over the three-year period, suggesting a shift in investment priorities or a response to changing market conditions.",

      "question": "How did CVS's investment in residential mortgage-backed securities evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year trend suggest about the company's risk exposure and strategic positioning in fixed-income assets?",
      "answer": "CVS's investment in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) increased significantly from $629 million in 2022 to $614 million in 2023, and then declined sharply to $71 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a strategic pivot away from RMBS in 2024, following a multi-year period of relatively high exposure. The unrealized losses also rose from $10 million in 2022 to $60 million in 2023, reflecting increased risk exposure during that time. The sharp reduction in 2024 suggests a deliberate de-risking or reallocation strategy, likely in response to market conditions or internal portfolio rebalancing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CVS](2022) \u2192 [Residential mortgage-backed securities]: CVS held $629 million in RMBS with $10 million in unrealized losses, indicating moderate exposure.",
        "Hop 2: [CVS](2023) \u2192 [Residential mortgage-backed securities]: CVS increased RMBS holdings to $614 million with a significant rise in unrealized losses to $60 million, showing increased risk exposure.",
        "Hop 3: [CVS](2024) \u2192 [Residential mortgage-backed securities]: CVS sharply reduced RMBS holdings to $71 million, signaling a strategic shift away from this asset class."

      "answer": "CVS's Separate Accounts Assets decreased from $5,087 million in 2022 to $3,250 million in 2023, and further declined to $3,311 million in 2024. This represents a significant reduction in exposure to these assets over the three-year period, suggesting a strategic shift or market-driven reduction in investment-linked insurance products.",

      "answer": "CVS's exposure to hedge fund limited partnership investments increased from $214 million in 2022 to $225 million in 2023, and further to $252 million in 2024.

      "question": "How did CVS's investment in foreign securities evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of fair value and unrealized losses, and what does this trend suggest about the company's exposure to international market risks?",
      "answer": "CVS's investment in foreign securities increased significantly from 2022 to 2023 but dropped sharply in 2024. In 2022, the fair value of foreign securities was $838 million with $24 million in unrealized losses. In 2023, this grew to $1,650 million in fair value with $122 million in unrealized losses, indicating increased exposure and volatility. However, by 2024, the fair value of foreign securities had declined to $51 million, a dramatic reduction from the prior year. This trajectory suggests a strategic de-risking or reallocation of assets away from foreign securities, likely in response to rising unrealized losses and global market instability.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group's venture investments were part of its broader equity securities portfolio, which grew from $3.7 billion in 2022 to $4.9 billion in 2023 and remained stable at $4.9 billion in 2024. Meanwhile, its equity method investments in healthcare businesses showed a significant increase, rising from $1.5 billion in 2023 to $3.8 billion in 2024, after remaining flat at $1.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. This indicates a strategic shift in 2024 toward deeper, more integrated investments in operating businesses within the healthcare sector.",

By 2024, the company continued to highlight the ongoing risk from CMS adjustments to payment mechanisms, particularly around beneficiary health status data submissions, and maintained its strategic focus on cost control and selective market participation.

Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets.\n\nAs a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nWe participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.",

A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, has affected and in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate are generally subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage (such as Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in certain states), reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in, or prevent our ex pansion into, certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For ex ample, CMS in the past has reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid programs. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. Chronic failure to meet the benchmarks could result in termination of these government contracts. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submissions by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting specified quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to maintain or improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet evolving government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or ex clusion from these or other government programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding and adjust monthly capitation payments for Medicare programs. For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For ex ample, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's fair value and carrying value of Debt Securities - Held-to-Maturity evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year trend indicate about the company's investment strategy and valuation assumptions?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group's fair value of Debt Securities - Held-to-Maturity decreased from $643 million to $596 million in 2023, and further declined to $508 million in 2024. Similarly, the carrying value dropped from $641 million in 2022 to $603 million in 2023, and then to $512 million in 2024. This consistent decline suggests a strategic reduction in exposure to held-to-maturity debt securities over the three-year period, with a notable shift away from Level 3 unobservable inputs by 2023 and 2024, indicating greater reliance on more liquid or observable market pricing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group identified the mix of benefits offered as a key factor influencing medical cost PMPM trend estimates, specifically noting its interaction with co-pays and deductibles. By 2023, the sensitivity analysis showed a negative impact from this factor, indicating increased exposure or a worsening trend in cost variability linked to benefit mix changes. In 2024, the mix of benefits remained a material sensitivity, continuing to impact medical cost estimates. The 3-year progression suggests a growing or sustained risk from benefit design variability, which may reflect strategic shifts in plan offerings or increasing healthcare utilization sensitivity to benefit structures.",

Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, which included consideration of COVID-19. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19.\n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics.\n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2024:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Patents covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredients ('API') of some of our products are held by third parties. We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.  For  a  description  of  our  significant  pending  legal  proceedings,  see  Note  13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trade Secrets\n\nWe also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property.\n\n## Raw Materials and Manufacturing\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain through inventory management, relationship management and the evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.\n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2024, these facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials.\n- La V erne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim. We also utilize the La V erne facility for clinical manufacturing of our sterile drug products.\n- Oceanside, California:  We utilize the facility for commercial retroviral vector manufacturing and clinical manufacturing and process development of our biologics candidates.\n- El Segundo, California: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Santa Monica, California: We utilize the facility for clinical manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Frederick, Maryland: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Cork and Dublin, Ireland: We utilize the Cork facility for commercial manufacturing, packaging and labeling of our products. We also perform quality control testing, labeling, packaging and final release of many of our products at the Cork facility, which are distributed to the EU and other international markets through our facility in Dublin.\n- Edmonton, Canada: We conduct process chemistry research and scale-up activities for our clinical development candidates, manufacture API for both investigational and commercial products and conduct chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes.\n- Hoofddorp, Netherlands: We utilize the facility for commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland. Our principal manufacturing facilities are in El Segundo, La Verne, Oceanside and San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Canada; Cork, Ireland and Hoofddorp, Netherlands. For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see Item 1. Business ' Our Manufacturing Facilities. ' Our global operations include offices in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to purchase, lease or construct any additional facilities required to meet our expected long-term growth needs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland. Our principal manufacturing facilities are in El Segundo, La Verne, Oceanside and San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Canada; Cork, Ireland and Hoofddorp, Netherlands. For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see Item 1. Business ' Our Manufacturing Facilities. ' Our global operations include offices in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to purchase, lease or construct any additional facilities required to meet our expected long-term growth needs.",

We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2.

We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.

          "chunk_text": "Patents covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredients ('API') of some of our products are held by third parties. We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.  For  a  description  of  our  significant  pending  legal  proceedings,  see  Note  13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trade Secrets\n\nWe also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property.\n\n## Raw Materials and Manufacturing\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain through inventory management, relationship management and the evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.\n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2024, these facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials.\n- La V erne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim. We also utilize the La V erne facility for clinical manufacturing of our sterile drug products.\n- Oceanside, California:  We utilize the facility for commercial retroviral vector manufacturing and clinical manufacturing and process development of our biologics candidates.\n- El Segundo, California: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Santa Monica, California: We utilize the facility for clinical manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Frederick, Maryland: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Cork and Dublin, Ireland: We utilize the Cork facility for commercial manufacturing, packaging and labeling of our products. We also perform quality control testing, labeling, packaging and final release of many of our products at the Cork facility, which are distributed to the EU and other international markets through our facility in Dublin.\n- Edmonton, Canada: We conduct process chemistry research and scale-up activities for our clinical development candidates, manufacture API for both investigational and commercial products and conduct chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes.\n- Hoofddorp, Netherlands: We utilize the facility for commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland. Our principal manufacturing facilities are in El Segundo, La Verne, Oceanside and San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Canada; Cork, Ireland and Hoofddorp, Netherlands. For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see Item 1. Business ' Our Manufacturing Facilities. ' Our global operations include offices in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to purchase, lease or construct any additional facilities required to meet our expected long-term growth needs.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, UnitedHealth Group's notes payable to subsidiaries increased significantly, rising from $8.1 billion in 2022 to $9.9 billion in 2023, and then dropping sharply to $2.0 billion in 2024. Throughout this period, the company consistently disclosed that its service level guarantees under certain contracts were not material in any given year. However, the volatility in notes payable suggests shifting liquidity strategies or contractual obligations tied to its internal financing arrangements. Despite these fluctuations, the company maintained that the financial impact of service level guarantees did not pose a material risk to its financial statements in any of the three years.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group consistently faced exposure to Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payment changes, with CMS altering calculation methodologies each year. In 2022, the company noted CMS had previously reduced or frozen benchmarks and was making changes to risk adjustment calculations. In response, UNH adjusted benefits and premiums selectively and intensified cost management. In 2023, similar pressures persisted, with the company continuing to adapt by modifying benefits, exiting certain counties, and managing medical costs more aggressively. By 2024, CMS had again made changes to the risk adjustment payment methodology, prompting UNH to further refine its strategies, including more selective benefit design and intensified cost controls. The consistent theme across all three years was the company's evolving response to CMS's recalibrations of risk adjustment payments, which required ongoing adjustments to pricing, benefits, and operational efficiency to maintain profitability and competitiveness.",

Some of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, has affected and in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate are generally subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage (such as Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in certain states), reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in, or prevent our ex pansion into, certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For ex ample, CMS in the past has reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid programs. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. Chronic failure to meet the benchmarks could result in termination of these government contracts. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submissions by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting specified quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to maintain or improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet evolving government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or ex clusion from these or other government programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding and adjust monthly capitation payments for Medicare programs. For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group's Debt Securities - Held-to-Maturity showed a consistent decline in both fair value and carrying value: in 2022, fair value was $679 million and carrying value was $696 million; in 2023, these figures were $596 million and $603 million; and in 2024, they dropped further to $508 million and $512 million.

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group cited the mix of benefits offered as a key factor influencing medical cost trends, specifically noting its sensitivity to co-pays, deductibles, and service utilization levels. By 2023, the company expanded its sensitivity analysis to include broader macroeconomic variables like GDP growth and disposable income alongside benefit mix impacts. In 2024, the sensitivity framework remained consistent with 2023, but the company emphasized increased volatility in benefit mix effects due to post-pandemic shifts in health plan selection and utilization behavior. This evolution suggests a growing recognition of benefit design as a dynamic risk factor requiring more nuanced modeling over time.",

      "question": "How did Pfizer's relationship with Meridian evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of financial impact, contractual arrangements, and strategic positioning, and what does this progression indicate about Pfizer's long-term focus in this business area?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's relationship with Meridian underwent a clear transformation from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, Meridian was still presented as part of discontinued operations, indicating it was a legacy business being phased out. By 2023, Pfizer had completed the sale of Meridian in late 2021 for $51 million in cash, recognizing a $167 million net loss, and was operating under a Manufacturing Supply Agreement (MSA) that extended for three years post-sale with a two-year extension option. In 2024, Meridian was listed in Pfizer's glossary as 'Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.', indicating a formalized but likely reduced relationship. This evolution shows Pfizer's strategic shift away from direct ownership of Meridian toward a more arms-length, contract-based relationship, consistent with a broader refocusing on core therapeutic areas and platform technologies like mRNA.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PFE](2022) \u2192 [Meridian]: Meridian was still referenced as part of discontinued operations, indicating it was no longer part of Pfizer's ongoing business as of 2022.",

        "Hop 3: [PFE](2024) \u2192 [Meridian]: Meridian was formally referenced in Pfizer's glossary as 'Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.', indicating a continued but arms-length relationship."

      "answer": "Pfizer's long-term investment in private equity securities at cost increased from $623 million in 2022 to $755 million in 2023, then slightly declined to $719 million in 2024. This indicates a short-term growth strategy in alternative investments in 2023, followed by a modest retrenchment in 2024, suggesting a cautious approach to illiquid asset allocation despite broader shifts in Pfizer's investment portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2022) \u2192 [Private Equity Securities at Cost]: $623 million in long-term investments, reflecting initial baseline allocation.",

        "Hop 3: [PFE](2024) \u2192 [Private Equity Securities at Cost]: Decreased slightly to $719 million, signaling a partial reversal or rebalancing of the prior year's growth."

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer disclosed ongoing transitional service arrangements (TSAs) and manufacturing services agreements (MSAs) with Viatris, with $94 million net due to Viatris under these agreements. By 2023, most TSAs had been completed as of December 31, with only MSAs continuing, and the net amount due to Viatris decreased to $33 million. In 2024, Viatris is still referenced in Pfizer's disclosures as part of the Upjohn Business spin-off, indicating a continued but diminished relationship primarily through long-term MSAs. This shows a consistent reduction in intercompany financial obligations and a transition from active collaboration to a more arms-length relationship.",

At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nOur Biopharma business includes the following therapeutic areas and key products:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Xtandi was classified as part of Pfizer's 'Developed Technology Rights' portfolio, indicating it was a mature, commercialized asset contributing to the company's diversified product base. By 2023, Xtandi's revenue declined by 1%, driven by lower net pricing due to unfavorable channel mix, though demand remained stable. In 2024, Xtandi's strategic value increased as Pfizer secured new approvals for the product\u2014specifically for treating non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) with biochemical recurrence at high risk for metastasis\u2014marking a shift from asset holding and revenue generation to therapeutic expansion and lifecycle management.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2022) \u2192 [Xtandi]: Xtandi is listed as a significant component of 'Developed Technology Rights', indicating it is a mature, commercialized asset within Pfizer\u2019s diversified portfolio.",
        "Hop 2: [PFE](2023) \u2192 [Xtandi]: Xtandi experienced a 1% revenue decline, attributed to lower net pricing from unfavorable channel mix, signaling early signs of pricing pressure or market saturation.",
        "Hop 3: [PFE](2024) \u2192 [Xtandi]: Xtandi received new U.S. and EU approvals for nmCSPC with high-risk biochemical recurrence, reflecting a strategic pivot toward expanding its therapeutic footprint and extending product lifecycle."

          "chunk_text": "\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount primarily reflects $500 million of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. (a)\n\nThe decrease is primarily due to amortization, partially offset by the capitalization of the Comirnaty milestones described above. (b)\n\n## Developed Technology Rights\n\nDeveloped technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\n\n## Brands\n\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\n\n## IPR&amp;D\n\nIPR&amp;D assets represent R&amp;D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen was investigating Olpasiran, an siRNA drug, in phase 2 trials for the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease. By 2023, the company disclosed that Olpasiran had U.S. and European patent protection for 'Compounds' estimated to expire in 2036, signaling strong intellectual property positioning. In 2024, Olpasiran was listed as being indicated for 'Cardiovascular disease,' suggesting a continued focus on CV applications and a transition from phase 2 investigation toward more advanced development or potential regulatory preparation. This progression reflects a strategic evolution from early clinical investigation to therapeutic consolidation and IP protection.",

      "answer": "Amgen's Phase 3 clinical program portfolio grew significantly from 13 programs in 2022 to 24 programs in 2024, with a notable increase to 18 programs in 2023. This growth reflects the company's strategic expansion in late-stage drug development, including the acquisition of five programs from Horizon in 2023 and the continued initiation of new Phase 3 studies. By 2024, Amgen had added one more program, bringing the total to 25, while also achieving regulatory approvals in both the U.S. and Japan.

Further,  we  cannot  predict  whether  any  repeal  or  reform  of  the  ACA  or  other  legislation  or  policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure 'first-to-market' or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nSome of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.\n\nMany of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta is available as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, and our AutoTouch reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates and products, including LUMAKRAS, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product  candidates  or  expanded  indications  of  our  products  used  with  such  devices  may  not  be  approved  or  may  be  substantially delayed  in  receiving  regulatory  approval  if  development  or  approval  of  such  devices  is  delayed,  such  devices  do  not  also  gain  or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device  is  sought  under  a  single  marketing  drug  application,  the  increased  complexity  of  the  review  process  may  delay  receipt  of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party  companies  continuing  to  meet  applicable  regulatory  or  other  requirements.  Failure  to  successfully  develop,  modify,  or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for  existing  products.  We  are  also  required  to  collect  and  assess  user  complaints,  adverse  events  and  malfunctions  regarding  our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For  example,  in  2017,  the  FDA  reported  on  its  adverse  event  reporting  system  that  it  was  evaluating  our  Neulasta  Onpro  kit. Subsequently,  we  implemented  device  and  labeling  enhancements  to  address  product  complaints  received  on  this  device.  We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully  develop,  supply,  or  gain  or  maintain  approval  for  these  devices  could  adversely  affect  sales  of  the  related  approved products.\n\nSome of our pharmaceutical pipeline  and  our  commercial  product  sales  rely  on  collaborations  with  third  parties,  which  may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.\n\nWe  depend  on  alliances  with  other  companies,  including  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  companies,  vendors  and  service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business-Business Relationships.\n\nFailures  by  these  parties  to  meet  their  contractual,  regulatory,  or  other  obligations  to  us  or  any  disruption  in  the  relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&amp;D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership  or  prosecution  of  intellectual  property  and  associated  rights  and  obligations.  This  could  result  in  the  loss  of  intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.",

          "chunk_text": "development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta Onpro kit. Subsequently, we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device. We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products. See also We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\n\nSome of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sales of our products.\n\nWe depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with  third  parties  under  which  we  share  development  rights,  obligations  and  costs  and/or  commercial  rights  and  obligations.  See  Item  1.  Business-Business Relationships.\n\nFailures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&amp;D and/or commercialization and sales often  ex tend  for  many  years  and  have  given,  and  may  in  the  future  give,  rise  to  disputes  regarding  the  relative  rights,  obligations  and  revenues  of  us  and  our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS\n\nWe perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.\n\nThe global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n\nWe currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial  disruption  in  our  ability  to  operate  our  Thousand  Oaks  manufacturing  facility  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  supply  our  product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.\n\nIn addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by a number of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Maria (2017) and Fiona (2022), as well as earthquakes (2020). These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico's electric grid and communications networks. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility relied on backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In 2021, the baseload power generation units of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority malfunctioned, leading to selective outages across the island. In September 2022, Hurricane Fiona caused further damage to the island's utility infrastructure which again resulted in widespread power outages and water supply issues. On December 31, 2024, an island-wide power outage also required that we operate on backup generators. Although these events did not directly have a material effect on our business, they have resulted in disruptions to our third-party suppliers on the island. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase our use of our generators or to use them exclusively. In addition, future storms,",

      "question": "How did Amgen's regulatory risk disclosures related to drug delivery devices evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in the context of clinical trial dependencies, post-marketing requirements, and device-related safety reviews?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen highlighted that some of its products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that carry their own regulatory, manufacturing, and other risks. By 2023, the company provided more detailed disclosures around the use of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials and how regulatory authorities were placing increased scrutiny on confirmatory studies, particularly for products like LUMAKRAS, which received accelerated approval but required additional post-marketing studies after a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. In 2024, Amgen reiterated these concerns, emphasizing that drug delivery devices used in combination with its products are subject to regulatory oversight and safety reviews, and that non-compliance with pharmacovigilance or quality assessment requirements could result in enforcement actions, including marketing authorization withdrawal. The trend shows a transformation in how Amgen frames its regulatory risk around drug delivery devices, shifting from general dependencies to specific post-marketing and safety compliance challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha to prevent cardiovascular events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels.\n\nSome of our products have been approved by U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, the FDA has approved LUMAKRAS under accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated local advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Following our submission of the LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS CodeBreaK 200 Phase 3 confirmatory data in March 2023 to the FDA and EMA, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA and a new post-marketing requirement for an additional confirmatory study to support full approval. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on whether the sponsors of products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis have met the conditions  of  the  accelerated  or  conditional  approvals.  If  we  are  unable  to  fulfill  the  regulators'  requirements  that  were  conditions  of  a  product's  accelerated  or conditional approval and/or if regulators reevaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product's labeled indications, conduct an additional confirmatory clinical trial, or even withdraw the product from the market.\n\nRegulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product's marketing authorization.\n\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS, see Part I, Item 1. Business -Government Regulation-Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to help ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as  implementing  revised  or  restrictive  labeling.  The  drug  delivery  devices  approved  for  use  in  combination  with  our  products  are  also  subject  to  regulatory oversight  and  review  for  safety  and  malfunctions.  See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support  programs  or  licensees  of  our  products)  have  not  complied  with  the  applicable  reporting,  other  pharmacovigilance  or  other  safety  or  quality  assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product's approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:\n\n- revised  or  restrictive  labeling  for  our  products,  or  the  potential  for  restrictive  labeling  that  has  resulted,  and  may  in  the  future  result,  in  our  decision  not  to commercialize a product candidate;\n- requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;\n- post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;\n- product recalls of our approved products;",

      "answer": "Amgen's positioning around Bemarituzumab evolved significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, Bemarituzumab was introduced as being in phase 3 clinical trials for GEJ adenocarcinoma, signaling active development. In 2023, Amgen disclosed intellectual property details, estimating the U.S. and European patent expiration for Bemarituzumab at 2029. By 2024, the company provided a more detailed description of the drug\u2019s mechanism and expanded its investigational scope to include gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer and advanced solid tumors beyond NSCLC.

In 2024, Cyramza remained a core oncology offering with no new indications added, but its therapeutic positioning was reaffirmed across the same cancer types.

      "answer": "LLY's collaboration with AbCellera saw a complete revenue lifecycle from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, LLY recognized $2.02 billion in net product revenue from sales of the COVID-19 antibodies bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab, with AbCellera receiving tiered royalty payments in the mid-teens to mid-twenties on these sales. In 2023, there were no sales of these antibodies, resulting in zero revenue contribution and no new royalty payments. By 2024, sales remained at $0, indicating that the product lifecycle had concluded. This pattern reveals a sharp decline in relevance of this partnership from a revenue and strategic standpoint after 2022.",

      "question": "How did LLY's allocation to private alternative investments evolve from 2022 to 2024, specifically in terms of total value for Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and what does this trend suggest about the company's long-term investment strategy?",
      "answer": "LLY's allocation to private alternative investments for Defined Benefit Pension Plans increased from $10,542.5 million in 2022 to $10,335.2 million in 2023, and then slightly rose to $10,051.0 million in 2024. This indicates a consistent emphasis on private alternative investments, albeit with minor reductions over the three-year period, suggesting a sustained but cautiously evolving long-term investment strategy.",

      "question": "How did Eli Lilly's (LLY) financial exposure to bamlanivimab evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of royalty obligations to AbCellera and the product's contribution to revenue, and what does this reveal about the long-term strategic importance of the product?",
      "answer": "Eli Lilly's exposure to bamlanivimab declined significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company still reported $2,008.9 million in U.S. revenue from 'COVID-19 antibodies,' which included bamlanivimab, and had ongoing royalty obligations to AbCellera based on tiered percentages ranging from mid-teens to mid-twenties on global sales. By 2023, U.S. revenue from the category had dropped to zero, signaling a full phase-out of the product's commercial relevance. In 2024, the product was no longer mentioned in revenue tables, confirming its complete exit from LLY's active portfolio. This trajectory shows that while bamlanivimab was a significant contributor during the pandemic, it has since lost strategic importance as demand waned and focus shifted to newer therapeutic areas like cardiometabolic health.",

        "Hop 1: [LLY](2022) \u2192 [bamlanivimab]: Introduced as part of a co-development agreement with AbCellera, with tiered royalty obligations and $2.24 billion in net product revenue in 2021, indicating its importance during the pandemic.",
        "Hop 2: [LLY](2023) \u2192 [bamlanivimab]: No longer reported in revenue tables, suggesting a significant decline in commercial activity and contribution, though royalty obligations likely persisted based on prior sales.",
        "Hop 3: [LLY](2024) \u2192 [bamlanivimab]: No mention of the product in revenue tables, indicating a full exit from the market, with no further financial impact or strategic relevance."

AbCellera has the right to receive tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab with percentages ranging in the mid-teens to mid-twenties. Royalty payments made to AbCellera are recorded as cost of sales.\n\nIn 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Junshi Biosciences to co-develop therapeutic antibodies for the potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19, including etesevimab, for which we hold development and commercialization rights outside of mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and for which Junshi Biosciences currently maintains all rights in mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Junshi Biosciences has the right to receive royalty payments in the mid-teens on our net sales of etesevimab. Junshi Biosciences also had the right to receive certain development, success-based regulatory and sales-based milestones. In connection with the regulatory authorizations of etesevimab (for administration with bamlanivimab) as well as achievement of sales-based milestones in 2021, milestone payments of $195.0 million were capitalized as intangible assets and are being amortized to cost of sales over the estimated useful life of etesevimab. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $50.0 million of research and development expenses related to development milestones.\n\nPursuant to EUAs or similar regulatory authorizations, we recognized $2.24 billion and $871.2 million of net product revenue associated with our sales of our COVID-19 antibodies during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

      "question": "How did the financial structure and strategic focus of LLY's collaboration with Incyte evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of milestone payments, royalty structures, and the role of Olumiant in LLY's revenue base?",

In 2022, LLY had capitalized $260.0 million in milestone payments tied to regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, with Incyte eligible for up to an additional $200.0 million in contingent payments (split evenly between regulatory and sales milestones). The royalty structure was tiered, with rates up to 20% on general sales and an additional low teens royalty for sales exceeding a threshold related to the treatment of COVID-19. In 2023, the focus shifted to ongoing revenue recognition, with LLY continuing to record royalty payments to Incyte as cost of sales, indicating the maturity of the partnership and the product's established market presence. By 2024, the collaboration remained financially consistent, but LLY emphasized the broader strategic positioning of Olumiant, including its use under EUA and the inclusion of follow-on compounds, suggesting a long-term commitment to the partnership and therapeutic expansion.

In 2024, the company expanded its discussion to include the impact of evolving CMS payment mechanisms, including risk adjustment and benchmark reductions, and again emphasized its selective benefit adjustments and cost control measures.

Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets.\n\nAs a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nWe participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.",

The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve.

For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process.

In 2023, these figures increased to $596 million in fair value and $603 million in carrying value. By 2024, the fair value had decreased to $508 million with a carrying value of $512 million.

      "question": "How did the sensitivity of UnitedHealth Group's medical cost per member per month (PMPM) estimates to changes in the mix of benefits offered evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's exposure to benefit design variability over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group identified the mix of benefits offered \u2014 including co-pays and deductibles \u2013 as a key factor influencing medical cost PMPM trend estimates, with sensitivity analysis conducted as part of broader cost estimation. By 2023, the company noted a negative impact from variations in benefit mix, indicating increased exposure or unfavorable movement in benefit design choices that likely increased medical cost liability. In 2024, the mix of benefits remained a core sensitivity factor, but the language shifted to a more neutral tone, suggesting that the company had either adjusted its benefit structures or improved its ability to manage the cost implications. This 3-year trajectory shows a transforming trend, where benefit mix evolved from a general sensitivity factor in 2022 to a source of financial risk in 2023 and then to a stabilized, though still significant, variable in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [UNH](2022) \u2192 [Mix of Benefits Offered]: Identified as a sensitivity factor in estimating medical cost PMPM, alongside other variables like pharmacy utilization and macroeconomic indicators.",
        "Hop 2: [UNH](2023) \u2192 [Mix of Benefits Offered]: Explicitly stated that changes in benefit mix negatively impacted medical cost estimates, indicating a period of increased risk exposure.",
        "Hop 3: [UNH](2024) \u2192 [Mix of Benefits Offered]: Mix of benefits remained a sensitivity factor, but the negative impact noted in 2023 was no longer emphasized, suggesting mitigation or normalization of the risk."

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s strategy around talc-related liabilities through LTL Management LLC shifted from an initial bankruptcy filing and litigation stay to repeated legal challenges and evolving settlement attempts. In 2022, LTL Management LLC was created through a corporate restructuring in October 2021, and it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, securing a Preliminary Injunction that stayed all talc-related litigation. The Company also established a $2 billion reserve to fund a trust for LTL liabilities. In 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision, forcing LTL to refile for bankruptcy (LTL 2), which resulted in a temporary restraining order and limited discovery. However, the LTL 2 case was dismissed in July 2023, prompting an appeal. By 2024, JNJ had reached multi-state settlement agreements with 42 states and the District of Columbia, signaling a shift toward resolution through negotiation, while continuing to appeal adverse bankruptcy rulings. Throughout this period, JNJ maintained its legal defense strategy while increasing settlement activity, reflecting a dual approach of litigation resistance and partial resolution.",

          "chunk_text": "potential claims; ability  to achiev e comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\n\n## Matters concerning talc\n\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the Company and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder.\n\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the M issouri Court of A ppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (M o. A pp.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. A n application for transfer of the case to the M issouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company's confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\n\nIn June 2014, the M ississippi A ttorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the M ississippi Consumer Protection A ct by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\n\nIn January 2020, the State of New M exico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\n\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company's marketing of its talcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state A ttorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements were finalized.\n\nIn October 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). A s a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL M anagement LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A &amp;M  LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RA M ); and (c) the Debtor's direct parent, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI's assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any  way  to injury  or damage, or alleged injury  or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility  for, any  such damage or injury , ex cept for any  liabilities for which the ex clusiv e remedy is provided under a workers' compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\n\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company's confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). A ll litigation against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in M arch 2022.\n\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\n\n94",

          "chunk_text": "disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion as of January 2, 2022. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company's rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management's estimates.\n\n## Litigation Contingencies - Talc\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management's confidence in the safety of the Company's talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson &amp; Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.",

      "answer": "JNJ's global sales from Interventional Solutions increased from $3,971 million in 2022 to $4,300 million in 2023, and further to $6,350 million in 2024. This significant upward trajectory indicates that the product segment became increasingly strategic following the acquisition in late 2022, with a notable acceleration in 2024, likely driven by integration and expanded market access.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JNJ(2023) \u2192 Interventional Solutions: Global sales reached $4,300 million, showing a modest increase from the prior year.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Johnson & Johnson consistently emphasized its multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative aimed at integrating, simplifying, and standardizing processes and systems across key functions including human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain, and finance. In 2022, the company noted that these enhancements were designed to support the growth of its financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems, and were not in response to any identified deficiencies in internal controls. By 2023, the company reiterated this strategic direction and highlighted that it was continuing to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment in response to the initiative. In 2024, the company maintained the same narrative, emphasizing that the initiative remained a proactive effort to enhance operational efficiency and control frameworks, not prompted by any material changes or weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. This consistent, multi-year approach reflects a long-term strategic commitment to process optimization and financial control modernization.",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion as of January 2, 2022. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company's rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management's estimates.\n\n## Litigation Contingencies - Talc\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management's confidence in the safety of the Company's talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson &amp; Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.",

To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\n\n## Matters concerning talc\n\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the Company and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder.\n\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the M issouri Court of A ppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (M o. A pp.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. A n application for transfer of the case to the M issouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company's confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\n\nIn June 2014, the M ississippi A ttorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the M ississippi Consumer Protection A ct by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\n\nIn January 2020, the State of New M exico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\n\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company's marketing of its talcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state A ttorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements were finalized.\n\nIn October 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). A s a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL M anagement LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A &amp;M  LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RA M ); and (c) the Debtor's direct parent, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI's assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any  way  to injury  or damage, or alleged injury  or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility  for, any  such damage or injury , ex cept for any  liabilities for which the ex clusiv e remedy is provided under a workers' compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\n\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company's confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). A ll litigation against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in M arch 2022.\n\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\n\n94",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's investment in its 2.250% Notes due 2050 remained relatively stable across the three years: $983 million in 2022, $826 million in 2023, and $808 million in 2024. The consistent presence of this debt instrument over time suggests a deliberate long-term capital structure strategy, with only minor reductions in exposure.

      "answer": "JNJ's global sales from Interventional Solutions grew from $3,971 million in 2021 to $4,300 million in 2022, representing an 8.3% increase. In 2023, this segment saw a significant acceleration, reaching $6,350 million globally\u2014an increase of 47.7% compared to 2022. This growth was driven by strong performance in both U.S. and international markets, with U.S. sales rising 67.5% and international sales growing 27.5%. In 2024, JNJ restructured its reporting, and the Interventional Solutions segment was renamed or absorbed under a new category, coinciding with the acquisition completed on May 31, 2024. This evolution reflects both organic growth and strategic acquisitions, culminating in a redefined product portfolio structure by 2024.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Johnson & Johnson has consistently emphasized its multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative aimed at integrating, simplifying, and standardizing processes and systems across key functions including finance. In 2022, the company described the initiative as a proactive effort to support the growth of its financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems, not in response to any internal control deficiencies. In 2023, the company reiterated this strategic direction, highlighting ongoing enhancements aligned with the initiative and affirming its commitment to streamlining the financial control environment. By 2024, the company maintained the same narrative, continuing to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment as part of the broader initiative. This consistent messaging across all three years indicates a long-term strategic commitment to process optimization and financial systems modernization, suggesting that the company views this initiative as foundational to its operational efficiency and control framework.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\nReports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to 'Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting', and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the 'Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm' included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2022, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of its employees have worked remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\n\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company's financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.\n\n## Item 9B.

Controls and procedures\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange A ct is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange A ct is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive V ice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, M essrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\nReports on internal control over financial reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to M anagement's report on internal control over financial reporting, and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the report of independent registered public accounting firm included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2024, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange A ct that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiv eness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\n\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company's financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiativ e, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.\n\n## Item 9B.

      "question": "How did Johnson & Johnson's pension plan structure evolve from 2022 through 2024 with respect to the Retirement Value formula, and what does this multi-year transition reveal about the company's long-term workforce strategy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Johnson & Johnson consistently communicated a strategic shift toward the Retirement Value formula for U.S. non-union employees, effective January 1, 2026. In 2022, the company reiterated that this change would apply to all eligible employees regardless of hire date, while preserving Final Average Pay formula benefits accrued before 2026. By 2023 and 2024, the disclosures maintained the same structural description of the Retirement Value formula, indicating no reversal or delay in the policy. The consistent messaging across all three years highlights a deliberate long-term workforce strategy to standardize retirement benefits and align them with total years of service and compensation, rather than final earnings, suggesting a shift toward cost predictability and broader workforce inclusivity in retirement planning.",

      "question": "How did the financial terms and commercial performance of LLY's collaboration with AbCellera on COVID-19 antibodies evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of royalty structure, milestone payments, and net product revenue?",
      "answer": "LLY's collaboration with AbCellera on COVID-19 antibodies showed a declining commercial trajectory from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, LLY recognized $2.02 billion in net product revenue from the sale of these antibodies, and AbCellera received tiered royalty payments ranging from mid-teens to mid-twenties on worldwide net sales. By 2023, sales had dropped to zero, indicating no further demand or regulatory authorization for the product. In 2024, there were still no sales, and no new milestone payments were made to AbCellera. The royalty structure remained consistent across years, but the absence of sales in the latter two years highlights a complete cessation of commercial activity related to this collaboration.",

        "Hop 1: LLY(2022) \u2192 AbCellera: LLY recognized $2.02 billion in net product revenue from the sale of COVID-19 antibodies, with AbCellera receiving tiered royalties in the mid-teens to mid-twenties on worldwide net sales.",
        "Hop 2: LLY(2024) \u2192 AbCellera: LLY reported no sales of its COVID-19 antibodies in 2024, and no milestone payments were made to AbCellera, with the royalty structure remaining unchanged.",
        "Hop 3: LLY(2023) \u2192 AbCellera: LLY had no sales of the antibodies in 2023, mirroring the 2024 situation, and again no milestone payments were made to AbCellera despite the ongoing royalty agreement."

AbCellera has the right to receive tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab with percentages ranging in the mid-teens to mid-twenties. Royalty payments made to AbCellera are recorded as cost of sales.\n\nIn 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Junshi Biosciences to co-develop therapeutic antibodies for the potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19, including etesevimab, for which we hold development and commercialization rights outside of mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and for which Junshi Biosciences currently maintains all rights in mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Junshi Biosciences has the right to receive royalty payments in the mid-teens on our net sales of etesevimab. Junshi Biosciences also had the right to receive certain development, success-based regulatory and sales-based milestones. In connection with the regulatory authorizations of etesevimab (for administration with bamlanivimab) as well as achievement of sales-based milestones in 2021, milestone payments of $195.0 million were capitalized as intangible assets and are being amortized to cost of sales over the estimated useful life of etesevimab. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $50.0 million of research and development expenses related to development milestones.\n\nPursuant to EUAs or similar regulatory authorizations, we recognized $2.24 billion and $871.2 million of net product revenue associated with our sales of our COVID-19 antibodies during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

This indicates a rapid decline in the company's reliance on this product as the pandemic response matured and demand for the antibody treatments waned.",

        "Hop 2: [LLY](2023) \u2192 [bamlanivimab]: In 2023, Eli Lilly reported $0 in revenue from bamlanivimab, signaling a complete phase-out of sales likely due to reduced public health emergency needs.",
        "Hop 3: [LLY](2024) \u2192 [bamlanivimab]: In 2024, bamlanivimab remained absent from revenue reports, confirming a full exit from the product line and a strategic pivot toward newer therapeutic areas."

AbCellera has the right to receive tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab with percentages ranging in the mid-teens to mid-twenties. Royalty payments made to AbCellera are recorded as cost of sales.\n\nIn 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Junshi Biosciences to co-develop therapeutic antibodies for the potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19, including etesevimab, for which we hold development and commercialization rights outside of mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and for which Junshi Biosciences currently maintains all rights in mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Junshi Biosciences has the right to receive royalty payments in the mid-teens on our net sales of etesevimab. Junshi Biosciences also had the right to receive certain development, success-based regulatory and sales-based milestones. In connection with the regulatory authorizations of etesevimab (for administration with bamlanivimab) as well as achievement of sales-based milestones in 2021, milestone payments of $195.0 million were capitalized as intangible assets and are being amortized to cost of sales over the estimated useful life of etesevimab. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $50.0 million of research and development expenses related to development milestones.\n\nPursuant to EUAs or similar regulatory authorizations, we recognized $2.24 billion and $871.2 million of net product revenue associated with our sales of our COVID-19 antibodies during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

      "question": "How did the financial structure and dependency dynamics of LLY's collaboration with Incyte evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of milestone payments, royalty rates, and revenue recognition practices?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LLY had capitalized $260.0 million and $210.0 million in milestone payments to Incyte as intangible assets tied to regulatory approvals and sales milestones, with Incyte eligible for up to an additional $200.0 million in contingent payments. The royalty structure included tiered double-digit rates up to 20% on worldwide net sales, with an additional low teens royalty for sales exceeding thresholds related to the treatment of COVID-19. By 2023, LLY continued to recognize sales of Olumiant as net product revenue, with Incyte royalties recorded as cost of sales, indicating consistent revenue recognition practices. In 2024, the royalty structure remained unchanged, but there was no mention of new milestone payments becoming due, suggesting that previously identified contingent payments from 2022 had either been triggered, paid, or were no longer anticipated. This progression indicates a deepening financial dependency on Incyte through sustained royalty obligations, even as milestone-related liabilities may have stabilized or been resolved.",

Incyte has the right to receive tiered, double digit royalty payments on worldwide net sales with rates ranging up to 20 percent. The agreement calls for payments by us to Incyte associated with certain development, success-based regulatory, and sales-based milestones. In 2020, the agreement was amended to include the treatment of COVID-19, with Incyte obtaining the right to receive an additional royalty ranging up to the low teens on worldwide net sales for the treatment of COVID-19 that exceed a specified aggregate worldwide net sales threshold.\n\nIn connection with the regulatory approvals of Olumiant in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, as well as achievement of a sales-based milestone, milestone payments of $260.0 million and $210.0 million were capitalized as intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are being amortized to cost of sales through the term of the collaboration. This represents the cumulative amounts that have been capitalized from the start of this collaboration through the end of each reporting period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Incyte is eligible to receive up to $100.0 million of additional payments from us contingent upon certain success-based regulatory milestones. Incyte is also eligible to receive up to $100.0 million of potential sales-based milestones.\n\nWe record our sales of Olumiant, including sales of baricitinib that were made pursuant to an EUA or similar regulatory authorizations, to third parties as net product revenue with the royalty payments made to Incyte recorded as cost of sales.

      "answer": "CVS's exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) decreased from $721 million in 2022 to $614 million in 2023, then increased to $71 million in 2024. This reflects a cautious reduction in RMBS holdings in 2023 amid rising unrealized losses, followed by a strategic rebalancing in 2024 with a smaller, more selective allocation. The trend suggests a dynamic risk management approach to structured credit amid macroeconomic uncertainty.",

        "Hop 1: [CVS](2022) \u2192 [Residential mortgage-backed securities]: CVS held $721 million in RMBS with $89 million in unrealized losses, indicating a significant but relatively stable allocation.",
        "Hop 2: [CVS](2023) \u2192 [Residential mortgage-backed securities]: RMBS holdings dropped to $614 million with unrealized losses rising to $60 million, showing a risk-off posture and reduced exposure amid market volatility.",

      "answer": "CVS's Separate Accounts Assets decreased from $5,087 million in 2022 to $3,250 million in 2023, and further declined to $3,311 million in 2024. This represents a significant drop between 2022 and 2023, followed by a slight rebound in 2024. The downward trend suggests a strategic reduction or reallocation of assets tied to separate accounts, potentially reflecting changes in insurance product offerings, investment strategies, or regulatory positioning.",

In 2024, the fair value of CMBS dropped dramatically to just $3 million, indicating a major reduction in exposure.

      "question": "What trend can be observed in CVS's foreign securities investments across its 2022-2024 filings, and how might this reflect the company's approach to managing international market risks?",
      "answer": "CVS's investment in foreign securities showed a distinct pattern of growth and subsequent reduction across the three-year period. In 2022, the company held foreign securities with a fair value of $838 million, which increased significantly to $1,650 million by the end of 2023. However, by 2024, the fair value of foreign securities dropped to $51 million. This trajectory suggests a strategic increase in international exposure during 2022-2023, followed by a sharp reduction in 2024, potentially indicating a recalibration of international market risk exposure in response to market conditions or internal strategic shifts.",

      "question": "How did the role and utilization of Gilead's El Segundo, California facility in cell therapy manufacturing evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its clinical and commercial production responsibilities?",
      "answer": "The role of Gilead's El Segundo, California facility in cell therapy manufacturing remained consistent across the three years, with no significant changes in its clinical and commercial production responsibilities. In 2022, the facility was described as being utilized for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of cell therapy products, reflecting its dual role in both trial-related and market-ready production. This utilization was reaffirmed in 2023, where the facility continued to serve as a key site for both clinical and commercial manufacturing of cell therapy products, indicating sustained operational importance. In 2024, the facility maintained its function, with no expansion or reduction in responsibilities documented in the filings, showing continuity in Gilead\u2019s strategic use of El Segundo for cell therapy manufacturing. This consistency suggests a stable operational footprint at the El Segundo site for cell therapy despite broader changes in Gilead\u2019s manufacturing network.",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland. Our principal manufacturing facilities are in El Segundo, La Verne, Oceanside and San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Canada; Cork, Ireland and Hoofddorp, Netherlands. For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see Item 1. Business ' Our Manufacturing Facilities. ' Our global operations include offices in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to purchase, lease or construct any additional facilities required to meet our expected long-term growth needs.",

We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.  For  a  description  of  our  significant  pending  legal  proceedings,  see  Note  13.

For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors.

      "question": "How has Gilead Sciences' utilization of its Foster City, California facility evolved from 2022 through 2024 in terms of R&D focus, manufacturing responsibilities, and strategic alignment with its global operations?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Gilead Sciences' Foster City, California facility transitioned from being primarily described as housing administrative, manufacturing, and R&D activities (2022) to being more specifically aligned with process chemistry research, analytical method development, formulation, device development, and the manufacturing of API and drug product for clinical trials (2023\u20132024). In 2022, Foster City was noted as the corporate headquarters and a key hub within a broader network of global properties. By 2023 and 2024, the facility's role was more narrowly defined with an emphasis on early-stage development and clinical manufacturing, suggesting a strategic shift toward consolidating R&D and clinical production capabilities in Foster City while other locations (e.g., La Verne, Oceanside, and international sites) handled commercial-scale manufacturing and distribution.",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland. Our principal manufacturing facilities are in El Segundo, La Verne, Oceanside and San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Canada; Cork, Ireland and Hoofddorp, Netherlands. For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see Item 1. Business ' Our Manufacturing Facilities. ' Our global operations include offices in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to purchase, lease or construct any additional facilities required to meet our expected long-term growth needs.",

For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.

We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.

We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.

For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property.\n\n## Raw Materials and Manufacturing\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain through inventory management, relationship management and the evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.\n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2024, these facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials.\n- La V erne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim.

We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.

For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property.\n\n## Raw Materials and Manufacturing\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain through inventory management, relationship management and the evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.\n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2024, these facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials.\n- La V erne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim.

      "answer": "In 2022, GILD's Oceanside facility was referenced as part of its broader operational footprint, indicating its role in research and development alongside other California-based sites. By 2023, the facility was specifically highlighted for its role in clinical manufacturing and process development of biologics candidates. In 2024, the Oceanside facility was further emphasized as the dedicated site for commercial retroviral vector manufacturing, in addition to continuing its role in clinical manufacturing and process development. This progression shows a strategic shift from general R&D to a more specialized and scaled-up function focused on biologics and retroviral vectors, aligning with GILD's broader biopharma manufacturing priorities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland. Our principal manufacturing facilities are in El Segundo, La Verne, Oceanside and San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Canada; Cork, Ireland and Hoofddorp, Netherlands. For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see Item 1. Business ' Our Manufacturing Facilities. ' Our global operations include offices in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to purchase, lease or construct any additional facilities required to meet our expected long-term growth needs.",

      "question": "How did Pfizer's treatment of Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of grant activity, valuation methodology, and recognition in financial statements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer granted 1,165 thousand BPAs with a weighted average intrinsic value of $38.73 per share, and by the end of the year, 859 thousand BPAs remained nonvested. In 2023, Pfizer disclosed that no BPAs were granted and none were outstanding as of December 31, 2023, indicating a complete wind-down of the program. In 2024, Pfizer described the valuation and recognition methodology for BPAs, stating they are valued using the intrinsic value method and amortized over the probable vesting term, with adjustments based on stock price changes and performance goal probabilities. This shows a shift from active issuance and vesting in 2022 to no outstanding awards by 2023, followed by a detailed focus on valuation mechanics in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Meridian was referenced in the context of discontinued operations, with its operating results presented as part of that category for all periods presented. By 2023, Meridian had been fully divested, with Pfizer completing the sale on December 31, 2021, for approximately $51 million in cash and recognizing a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax. In 2024, Meridian is only mentioned as a defined entity (Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.) in the glossary of terms, indicating no active financial or operational relationship remained. This progression shows a complete strategic disengagement from Meridian, transitioning from operational integration (in prior periods), to divestiture, to mere definitional reference.",

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\n\n## Changes in Internal Controls\n\nDuring our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n107",

At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nOur Biopharma business includes the following therapeutic areas and key products:\n\n",

      "question": "How did Pfizer's strategic positioning and financial performance related to Xtandi evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of asset classification, new indications, and revenue performance?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Xtandi was classified as part of Pfizer's 'Developed Technology Rights' portfolio, indicating its established status as a commercialized product. By 2024, Xtandi had expanded its therapeutic footprint with a new FDA approval in November 2023 for non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) with high-risk biochemical recurrence, signaling a strategic effort to broaden its market reach. However, in 2023, Xtandi experienced a revenue decline of 1%, attributed to lower net pricing due to unfavorable channel mix, despite some demand growth. This combination of asset maturity, indication expansion, and slight revenue contraction reflects a product in transition\u2014leveraging new indications to offset pricing pressures in existing markets.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2022) \u2192 [Xtandi]: Xtandi is listed as part of the 'Developed Technology Rights' portfolio, indicating it is a mature, commercialized asset.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount primarily reflects $500 million of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. (a)\n\nThe decrease is primarily due to amortization, partially offset by the capitalization of the Comirnaty milestones described above. (b)\n\n## Developed Technology Rights\n\nDeveloped technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\n\n## Brands\n\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\n\n## IPR&amp;D\n\nIPR&amp;D assets represent R&amp;D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

By 2024, it remained a key oncology product, maintaining the same therapeutic indications. Meanwhile, its intellectual property protection timeline shifted significantly between 2023 and 2024, with data protection expiring in Japan in 2023 and set to expire in major European countries in 2024, while compound patents in the U.S. and Europe extend to 2026 and 2028, respectively. This indicates a narrowing window of exclusivity in key international markets despite continued therapeutic relevance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LLY recognized $2.02 billion in net product revenue from its sales of AbCellera-partnered COVID-19 antibodies (bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab), with royalty payments to AbCellera in the mid-teens to mid-twenties percentage range on worldwide net sales. In 2023, LLY had no sales of these antibodies, resulting in no royalty payments to AbCellera. In 2024, the trend continued with no sales reported, indicating a complete wind-down of the product line. This 3-year progression shows a sharp decline in revenue and corresponding royalty obligations after the peak in 2022, reflecting reduced demand or regulatory changes affecting EUA-based sales.",

      "question": "How has Eli Lilly's bamlanivimab product trajectory evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly regarding revenue contribution and strategic importance?",
      "answer": "In 2022, bamlanivimab was introduced as a key component of Eli Lilly's portfolio of COVID-19 antibodies through a collaboration agreement with AbCellera, with royalty payments ranging from mid-teens to mid-twenties on global sales. It contributed significantly to the 'Other' category in 2022, generating $2,008.9 million in U.S. revenue. By 2023, bamlanivimab remained part of the company's portfolio, as evidenced by its inclusion in the 'Other' category with $144.2 million in non-U.S. revenue, though its prominence had decreased. However, by 2024, bamlanivimab no longer appeared as a standalone revenue contributor in the financial tables, suggesting it had been phased out or fully integrated into another product line. This trajectory indicates a shift from being a strategically important and high-revenue product in 2022 to a diminished or discontinued role by 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2023) \u2192 bamlanivimab: Bamlanivimab was still present in the 'Other' category, contributing $144.2 million in non-U.S. revenue, indicating continued but reduced relevance.",
        "Hop 2: LLY(2024) \u2192 bamlanivimab: Bamlanivimab no longer appears as a distinct revenue contributor in the financial tables, suggesting it was phased out or absorbed into another product line.",
        "Hop 3: LLY(2022) \u2192 bamlanivimab: Bamlanivimab was introduced as part of the company's strategic response to the pandemic, with a major collaboration with AbCellera and contributed $2,008.9 million in U.S. revenue in 2022."

AbCellera has the right to receive tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab with percentages ranging in the mid-teens to mid-twenties. Royalty payments made to AbCellera are recorded as cost of sales.\n\nIn 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Junshi Biosciences to co-develop therapeutic antibodies for the potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19, including etesevimab, for which we hold development and commercialization rights outside of mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and for which Junshi Biosciences currently maintains all rights in mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Junshi Biosciences has the right to receive royalty payments in the mid-teens on our net sales of etesevimab. Junshi Biosciences also had the right to receive certain development, success-based regulatory and sales-based milestones. In connection with the regulatory authorizations of etesevimab (for administration with bamlanivimab) as well as achievement of sales-based milestones in 2021, milestone payments of $195.0 million were capitalized as intangible assets and are being amortized to cost of sales over the estimated useful life of etesevimab. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $50.0 million of research and development expenses related to development milestones.\n\nPursuant to EUAs or similar regulatory authorizations, we recognized $2.24 billion and $871.2 million of net product revenue associated with our sales of our COVID-19 antibodies during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

      "question": "How did the financial obligations and royalty structure between LLY and Incyte for Olumiant evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of milestone payments, royalty rates, and the inclusion of new indications like COVID-19?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, LLY's financial relationship with Incyte around Olumiant evolved significantly. In 2022, Incyte was eligible to receive up to $100 million in additional regulatory milestones and $100 million in sales-based milestones, and royalty rates on worldwide net sales ranged up to 20%, with an additional low teens royalty for COVID-19 sales above a threshold. By 2023, milestone payments related to regulatory approvals and sales achievements were capitalized as intangible assets and amortized into cost of sales. In 2024, the agreement remained in place with the same royalty structure, but the focus shifted to ongoing royalty payments rather than new milestones, indicating that most contingent payments had likely been triggered or expired. This evolution reflects a shift from milestone-driven obligations to a more stable royalty-based payment model over the three-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2023) \u2192 Incyte: Milestone payments from prior years (e.g., $260M and $210M) were capitalized and amortized into cost of sales, indicating a legacy of contingent obligations now being realized.",
        "Hop 2: LLY(2024) \u2192 Incyte: The royalty structure remained intact (up to 20% for general sales, low teens for COVID-19 above threshold), but no new milestone payments were mentioned, suggesting most had been met or expired.",
        "Hop 3: LLY(2022) \u2192 Incyte: Incyte was still eligible for up to $100M in regulatory and $100M in sales-based milestones, showing the agreement was still active and contingent on performance metrics."

      "answer": "In 2022, Olpasiran was described as an siRNA in phase 2 development aimed at lowering lipoprotein(a) for the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

In 2024, Olpasiran was listed with a broader therapeutic indication simply as 'cardiovascular disease,' suggesting a potential expansion of its clinical application or regulatory strategy.

      "question": "How did Amgen's Phase 3 programs evolve from 2022 through 2024 in terms of quantity and development milestones, and what does this progression indicate about the company's R&D expansion strategy?",
      "answer": "Amgen's Phase 3 programs increased significantly from 13 programs as of February 8, 2022, to 18 programs as of January 31, 2023, and further to 24 programs as of January 31, 2024. By February 4, 2025 (noted in the 2024 filing), the number had grown to 25 Phase 3 programs, driven by five new initiations and regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Japan. This indicates a clear and sustained strategy to expand its late-stage pipeline, including external growth through acquisitions like Horizon Therapeutics in 2023, which added five Phase 3 programs. The consistent increase in Phase 3 programs and the combination of internal development and external acquisition suggest a focused effort to build a robust and diversified product portfolio.",

In 2022, the company referenced the FDA's 2017 evaluation of the Neulasta Onpro kit and the subsequent implementation of device and labeling enhancements. In 2023, Amgen reiterated the importance of addressing user complaints and highlighted the impact of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Fiona in 2022, on Puerto Rico's infrastructure, which affected third-party suppliers. By 2024, Amgen expanded its disclosures to include the December 31, 2024 island-wide power outage in Puerto Rico, which required reliance on backup generators, while continuing to emphasize the ongoing monitoring of user complaints and device enhancements.

Further,  we  cannot  predict  whether  any  repeal  or  reform  of  the  ACA  or  other  legislation  or  policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure 'first-to-market' or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nSome of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.\n\nMany of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta is available as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, and our AutoTouch reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates and products, including LUMAKRAS, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product  candidates  or  expanded  indications  of  our  products  used  with  such  devices  may  not  be  approved  or  may  be  substantially delayed  in  receiving  regulatory  approval  if  development  or  approval  of  such  devices  is  delayed,  such  devices  do  not  also  gain  or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device  is  sought  under  a  single  marketing  drug  application,  the  increased  complexity  of  the  review  process  may  delay  receipt  of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party  companies  continuing  to  meet  applicable  regulatory  or  other  requirements.  Failure  to  successfully  develop,  modify,  or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for  existing  products.  We  are  also  required  to  collect  and  assess  user  complaints,  adverse  events  and  malfunctions  regarding  our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For  example,  in  2017,  the  FDA  reported  on  its  adverse  event  reporting  system  that  it  was  evaluating  our  Neulasta  Onpro  kit. Subsequently,  we  implemented  device  and  labeling  enhancements  to  address  product  complaints  received  on  this  device.  We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market.

See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n\nWe currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial  disruption  in  our  ability  to  operate  our  Thousand  Oaks  manufacturing  facility  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  supply  our  product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.\n\nIn addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by a number of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Maria (2017) and Fiona (2022), as well as earthquakes (2020). These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico's electric grid and communications networks. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility relied on backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In 2021, the baseload power generation units of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority malfunctioned, leading to selective outages across the island. In September 2022, Hurricane Fiona caused further damage to the island's utility infrastructure which again resulted in widespread power outages and water supply issues. On December 31, 2024, an island-wide power outage also required that we operate on backup generators. Although these events did not directly have a material effect on our business, they have resulted in disruptions to our third-party suppliers on the island. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase our use of our generators or to use them exclusively. In addition, future storms,",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen highlighted that its products used with drug delivery devices face distinct regulatory, manufacturing, and compliance risks, and that disruptions could affect clinical trials and product supply. By 2023, the company detailed increasing regulatory scrutiny around surrogate endpoints and conditional approvals, such as the requirement to complete confirmatory studies for products like Repatha and LUMAKRAS. In 2024, Amgen expanded on the regulatory oversight of drug delivery devices used in combination with its products, noting that these devices are subject to safety reviews and that failure to meet post-marketing requirements could lead to enforcement actions, including labeling changes or product withdrawal. The trend shows a growing emphasis on post-market compliance and safety monitoring of integrated drug-device products.",

For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha to prevent cardiovascular events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels.\n\nSome of our products have been approved by U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, the FDA has approved LUMAKRAS under accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated local advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Following our submission of the LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS CodeBreaK 200 Phase 3 confirmatory data in March 2023 to the FDA and EMA, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA and a new post-marketing requirement for an additional confirmatory study to support full approval. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on whether the sponsors of products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis have met the conditions  of  the  accelerated  or  conditional  approvals.  If  we  are  unable  to  fulfill  the  regulators'  requirements  that  were  conditions  of  a  product's  accelerated  or conditional approval and/or if regulators reevaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product's labeled indications, conduct an additional confirmatory clinical trial, or even withdraw the product from the market.\n\nRegulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product's marketing authorization.\n\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS, see Part I, Item 1. Business -Government Regulation-Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to help ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as  implementing  revised  or  restrictive  labeling.  The  drug  delivery  devices  approved  for  use  in  combination  with  our  products  are  also  subject  to  regulatory oversight  and  review  for  safety  and  malfunctions.  See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support  programs  or  licensees  of  our  products)  have  not  complied  with  the  applicable  reporting,  other  pharmacovigilance  or  other  safety  or  quality  assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product's approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:\n\n- revised  or  restrictive  labeling  for  our  products,  or  the  potential  for  restrictive  labeling  that  has  resulted,  and  may  in  the  future  result,  in  our  decision  not  to commercialize a product candidate;\n- requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;\n- post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;\n- product recalls of our approved products;",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen initiated the phase 3 study for Bemarituzumab, marking the beginning of its advanced clinical development for GEJ adenocarcinoma. By 2023, Amgen disclosed that Bemarituzumab's patent protection for polypeptides was estimated to expire in 2029 in both the U.S. and Europe, indicating a defined IP strategy. In 2024, Amgen provided further context on Bemarituzumab's therapeutic focus, describing it as a monoclonal antibody targeting FGFR2b for gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer, and highlighted potential regulatory exclusivity periods that could extend its market protection. This progression shows a transition from early-phase development to a more mature pipeline asset with defined clinical and IP strategies.",

By 2023, the company explicitly identified El Segundo as a dedicated site for both clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of cell therapy products, signaling a strategic shift toward specialization in this high-growth therapeutic area (GILD_10k_2023.pdf:page_11:chunk_1). In 2024, El Segundo retained this designation, and the filing also emphasized Gilead\u2019s reliance on internal know-how and third-party confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary manufacturing technologies\u2014suggesting increased investment in securing and scaling proprietary cell therapy processes at this site (GILD_10k_2024.pdf:page_10:chunk_1).

If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland.

          "chunk_text": "Patents covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredients ('API') of some of our products are held by third parties. We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.  For  a  description  of  our  significant  pending  legal  proceedings,  see  Note  13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trade Secrets\n\nWe also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property.\n\n## Raw Materials and Manufacturing\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain through inventory management, relationship management and the evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.\n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2024, these facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials.\n- La V erne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim. We also utilize the La V erne facility for clinical manufacturing of our sterile drug products.\n- Oceanside, California:  We utilize the facility for commercial retroviral vector manufacturing and clinical manufacturing and process development of our biologics candidates.\n- El Segundo, California: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Santa Monica, California: We utilize the facility for clinical manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Frederick, Maryland: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Cork and Dublin, Ireland: We utilize the Cork facility for commercial manufacturing, packaging and labeling of our products. We also perform quality control testing, labeling, packaging and final release of many of our products at the Cork facility, which are distributed to the EU and other international markets through our facility in Dublin.\n- Edmonton, Canada: We conduct process chemistry research and scale-up activities for our clinical development candidates, manufacture API for both investigational and commercial products and conduct chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes.\n- Hoofddorp, Netherlands: We utilize the facility for commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Gilead's Foster City facility transitioned from a general R&D and API manufacturing site to a more strategically integrated hub for process chemistry, analytical development, and clinical production. In 2022, the facility was described as housing administrative, R&D, and manufacturing activities. By 2023, it was explicitly called out for conducting process chemistry research, analytical method development, formulation and device development, and clinical API and drug product manufacturing. In 2024, this characterization remained consistent, with an added emphasis on its role in supporting clinical trials through integrated development and production. This evolution suggests a strategic shift toward tighter integration of R&D and manufacturing to shorten development cycles and improve clinical trial readiness.",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland. Our principal manufacturing facilities are in El Segundo, La Verne, Oceanside and San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Canada; Cork, Ireland and Hoofddorp, Netherlands. For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see Item 1. Business ' Our Manufacturing Facilities. ' Our global operations include offices in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to purchase, lease or construct any additional facilities required to meet our expected long-term growth needs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2.

We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland.

          "chunk_text": "Patents covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredients ('API') of some of our products are held by third parties. We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.  For  a  description  of  our  significant  pending  legal  proceedings,  see  Note  13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trade Secrets\n\nWe also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property.\n\n## Raw Materials and Manufacturing\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain through inventory management, relationship management and the evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.\n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2024, these facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials.\n- La V erne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim. We also utilize the La V erne facility for clinical manufacturing of our sterile drug products.\n- Oceanside, California:  We utilize the facility for commercial retroviral vector manufacturing and clinical manufacturing and process development of our biologics candidates.\n- El Segundo, California: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Santa Monica, California: We utilize the facility for clinical manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Frederick, Maryland: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Cork and Dublin, Ireland: We utilize the Cork facility for commercial manufacturing, packaging and labeling of our products. We also perform quality control testing, labeling, packaging and final release of many of our products at the Cork facility, which are distributed to the EU and other international markets through our facility in Dublin.\n- Edmonton, Canada: We conduct process chemistry research and scale-up activities for our clinical development candidates, manufacture API for both investigational and commercial products and conduct chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes.\n- Hoofddorp, Netherlands: We utilize the facility for commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.",

          "chunk_text": "Patents covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredients ('API') of some of our products are held by third parties. We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties.\n\nWe often obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained. As a result, the commercial value of the patent may be limited because the patent term is based on the date the patent application was filed, which may be prior to the regulatory approval and commercial sale of the related product. However, we also apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates in some countries. For example, extensions for the patents or supplementary protection certificates on many of our products have been granted in the U.S. and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nFrom time to time,  certain  individuals  or  entities  may  challenge  our  patents.  For  a  description  of  our  significant  pending  legal  proceedings,  see  Note  13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trade Secrets\n\nWe also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have disclosed all necessary aspects of these technologies to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with third-party manufacturers, corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property.\n\n## Raw Materials and Manufacturing\n\nWe need access to certain raw materials to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our products. These raw materials are generally available from multiple sources and normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. We attempt to manage the risks associated with our supply chain through inventory management, relationship management and the evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.\n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities to manufacture and distribute certain products and API for clinical and/or commercial uses. As of the end of 2024, these facilities include:\n\n- Foster City, California: We conduct process chemistry research, analytical method development and formulation and device development activities, and manufacture API and drug product for our clinical trials.\n- La V erne, California: We manufacture AmBisome and also package and label the majority of our commercial products for distribution to the Americas and the Pacific Rim. We also utilize the La V erne facility for clinical manufacturing of our sterile drug products.\n- Oceanside, California:  We utilize the facility for commercial retroviral vector manufacturing and clinical manufacturing and process development of our biologics candidates.\n- El Segundo, California: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Santa Monica, California: We utilize the facility for clinical manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Frederick, Maryland: We utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.\n- Cork and Dublin, Ireland: We utilize the Cork facility for commercial manufacturing, packaging and labeling of our products. We also perform quality control testing, labeling, packaging and final release of many of our products at the Cork facility, which are distributed to the EU and other international markets through our facility in Dublin.\n- Edmonton, Canada: We conduct process chemistry research and scale-up activities for our clinical development candidates, manufacture API for both investigational and commercial products and conduct chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes.\n- Hoofddorp, Netherlands: We utilize the facility for commercial manufacturing and processing of our cell therapy products.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen disclosed that Olpasiran was an siRNA in phase 2 development aimed at lowering lipoprotein(a) for the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. By 2023, Amgen provided intellectual property details, indicating that Olpasiran's compound patents in both the U.S. and Europe were set to expire in 2036. In 2024, Olpasiran was listed as a produced therapeutic specifically targeting cardiovascular disease, suggesting it had advanced from investigational phase 2 status to a more defined position within Amgen\u2019s therapeutic portfolio, while maintaining the same long-term patent protection timeline. This progression indicates a strategic shift from early clinical focus to a more mature development and commercial positioning over the 3-year period.",

      "answer": "Amgen's Phase 3 clinical program portfolio grew significantly from 13 programs in 2022 to 18 programs in 2023, and further to 24 programs in 2024. This growth was driven by both internal initiation of new programs and external acquisitions, particularly the addition of five programs from Horizon in 2023. The consistent year-over-year increase indicates a strategic focus on expanding the late-stage pipeline to support long-term product development and market positioning.",

We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta Onpro kit. Subsequently, we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device. We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products. See also We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\n\nSome of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sales of our products.\n\nWe depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with  third  parties  under  which  we  share  development  rights,  obligations  and  costs  and/or  commercial  rights  and  obligations.  See  Item  1.  Business-Business Relationships.\n\nFailures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&amp;D and/or commercialization and sales often  ex tend  for  many  years  and  have  given,  and  may  in  the  future  give,  rise  to  disputes  regarding  the  relative  rights,  obligations  and  revenues  of  us  and  our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS\n\nWe perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.\n\nThe global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n\nWe currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial  disruption  in  our  ability  to  operate  our  Thousand  Oaks  manufacturing  facility  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  supply  our  product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.\n\nIn addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by a number of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Maria (2017) and Fiona (2022), as well as earthquakes (2020). These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico's electric grid and communications networks. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility relied on backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In 2021, the baseload power generation units of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority malfunctioned, leading to selective outages across the island. In September 2022, Hurricane Fiona caused further damage to the island's utility infrastructure which again resulted in widespread power outages and water supply issues. On December 31, 2024, an island-wide power outage also required that we operate on backup generators. Although these events did not directly have a material effect on our business, they have resulted in disruptions to our third-party suppliers on the island. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase our use of our generators or to use them exclusively. In addition, future storms,",

Further,  we  cannot  predict  whether  any  repeal  or  reform  of  the  ACA  or  other  legislation  or  policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure 'first-to-market' or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nSome of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.\n\nMany of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta is available as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, and our AutoTouch reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates and products, including LUMAKRAS, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product  candidates  or  expanded  indications  of  our  products  used  with  such  devices  may  not  be  approved  or  may  be  substantially delayed  in  receiving  regulatory  approval  if  development  or  approval  of  such  devices  is  delayed,  such  devices  do  not  also  gain  or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device  is  sought  under  a  single  marketing  drug  application,  the  increased  complexity  of  the  review  process  may  delay  receipt  of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party  companies  continuing  to  meet  applicable  regulatory  or  other  requirements.  Failure  to  successfully  develop,  modify,  or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for  existing  products.  We  are  also  required  to  collect  and  assess  user  complaints,  adverse  events  and  malfunctions  regarding  our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval . Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For  example,  in  2017,  the  FDA  reported  on  its  adverse  event  reporting  system  that  it  was  evaluating  our  Neulasta  Onpro  kit. Subsequently,  we  implemented  device  and  labeling  enhancements  to  address  product  complaints  received  on  this  device.  We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully  develop,  supply,  or  gain  or  maintain  approval  for  these  devices  could  adversely  affect  sales  of  the  related  approved products.\n\nSome of our pharmaceutical pipeline  and  our  commercial  product  sales  rely  on  collaborations  with  third  parties,  which  may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.\n\nWe  depend  on  alliances  with  other  companies,  including  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  companies,  vendors  and  service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business-Business Relationships.\n\nFailures  by  these  parties  to  meet  their  contractual,  regulatory,  or  other  obligations  to  us  or  any  disruption  in  the  relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&amp;D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership  or  prosecution  of  intellectual  property  and  associated  rights  and  obligations.  This  could  result  in  the  loss  of  intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.",

      "question": "How did Amgen's regulatory and operational dependencies on drug delivery devices evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to safety reporting, REMS compliance, and confirmatory trial requirements for products like Repatha and LUMAKRAS?",
      "answer": "Amgen's dependency on drug delivery devices became increasingly intertwined with regulatory expectations and safety compliance from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company acknowledged that some of its products were used with drug delivery devices that carried their own regulatory and manufacturing risks. By 2023, Amgen highlighted that drug delivery devices used in combination with its products were under regulatory oversight for safety and malfunctions, and that failure to meet pharmacovigilance or safety requirements could lead to enforcement actions. In 2024, the company expanded on this dependency, noting that adverse event reporting, REMS assessments, and periodic safety evaluations were critical to maintaining product approvals, especially for drugs like Repatha and LUMAKRAS, which required additional confirmatory studies to maintain or expand labeling. The trend reveals a growing emphasis on safety monitoring and regulatory alignment with device integration over time.",

For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha to prevent cardiovascular events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels.\n\nSome of our products have been approved by U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, the FDA has approved LUMAKRAS under accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated local advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Following our submission of the LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS CodeBreaK 200 Phase 3 confirmatory data in March 2023 to the FDA and EMA, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA and a new post-marketing requirement for an additional confirmatory study to support full approval. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on whether the sponsors of products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis have met the conditions  of  the  accelerated  or  conditional  approvals.  If  we  are  unable  to  fulfill  the  regulators'  requirements  that  were  conditions  of  a  product's  accelerated  or conditional approval and/or if regulators reevaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product's labeled indications, conduct an additional confirmatory clinical trial, or even withdraw the product from the market.\n\nRegulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product's marketing authorization.\n\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS, see Part I, Item 1. Business -Government Regulation-Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to help ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as  implementing  revised  or  restrictive  labeling.  The  drug  delivery  devices  approved  for  use  in  combination  with  our  products  are  also  subject  to  regulatory oversight  and  review  for  safety  and  malfunctions.  See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support  programs  or  licensees  of  our  products)  have  not  complied  with  the  applicable  reporting,  other  pharmacovigilance  or  other  safety  or  quality  assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product's approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:\n\n- revised  or  restrictive  labeling  for  our  products,  or  the  potential  for  restrictive  labeling  that  has  resulted,  and  may  in  the  future  result,  in  our  decision  not  to commercialize a product candidate;\n- requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;\n- post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;\n- product recalls of our approved products;",

The estimates do not include any term adjustments, extensions or supplemental protection certificates that may be obtained in the future and thereby extend these dates. Corresponding patent applications are pending in other jurisdictions. Additional patents may be filed or issued and may provide additional exclusivity for the product candidate or its use. In addition to patent exclusivity, the product candidates may be protected by regulatory exclusivities upon approval in some countries. For example, new chemical entities would receive a five year exclusivity period and new molecular entities would receive a 12 year exclusivity period in the United States, whereas new chemical and molecular entities would receive a 10 year ex clusivity period in Europe.

      "answer": "Across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014AbbVie consistently maintained a provision stating that stockholders may only remove directors for cause. This provision, included in each year\u2019s 10-K filing, was part of a broader set of anti-takeover defenses such as staggered board terms, restrictions on special meetings, and supermajority requirements for bylaw amendments. The repeated disclosure of this specific governance feature across all three filings indicates a stable and deliberate strategy to entrench board control and discourage hostile takeovers. Despite no explicit changes to the 'removal for cause' language, the consistent emphasis in each annual report underscores AbbVie\u2019s ongoing commitment to maintaining board stability and limiting shareholder influence over director tenure.",

        "Hop 1: [ABBV](2023) \u2192 [Director Removal for Cause]: Discloses that stockholders may only remove directors for cause as part of anti-takeover provisions.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AbbVie consistently described Ganfort as approved in the European Union and certain markets in South America, the Middle East, and Asia, with no explicit expansion into new regions during this period. However, the repeated emphasis on Ganfort's role in the company's global eye care portfolio across all three years highlights AbbVie's sustained focus on leveraging this product in key international markets as part of its broader ophthalmology strategy. This geographic consistency suggests a targeted approach to maintaining and potentially deepening its presence in these regions rather than broad geographic expansion.",

      "answer": "Danaher's investment in Diagnostics Testing Technologies through government grant funding showed a clear upward trend from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, $87 million of government grant funds were used to offset capital expenditures related to diagnostics testing technologies. This increased to $136 million in 2023 and further rose to $198 million in 2024. This consistent increase indicates that diagnostics testing technologies became increasingly central to Danaher\u2019s strategic focus in its healthcare portfolio, with growing government support enabling expanded production capacity and development in this area over the three-year period.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing manufacturing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company's businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and $791 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2021 was primarily due to incremental capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity for diagnostic testing and biopharma products (including to address increased COVID-19 related demand) as well as incremental capital expenditures as a result of the Cytiva and Aldevron Acquisitions. In 2022, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year to increase manufacturing capacity primarily to support customer demand for products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and other growth opportunities. The Company estimates capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including BARDA, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Life Sciences businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one to four years. In 2021, the Company received aggregate payments related to government grants of $73 million that offset operating expenses and capital expenditures of $41 million and $32 million, respectively.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.3 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $1.0 billion of cash provided during 2020. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to cash provided in 2021 from the issuance of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Aldevron Acquisition and the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by cash provided by the sale of common and preferred stock and borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes, as well as the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $22.2 billion and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $8 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $2.2 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company's $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has classified approximately $2.8 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, $699 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Biopharma Notes and $284 million of borrowings outstanding under the Floating Rate 2022 Euronotes as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available.\n\nUnder the Company's U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company's floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company's financial position. The U.S. dollar LIBOR-based borrowings will be available to the Company under the Five-Year Facility until 2023, upon the discontinuance of LIBOR. Prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company expects to amend the Five-Year Facility to replace LIBOR with another reference interest rate.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)-Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) refers to certain gains and losses that under GAAP are included in comprehensiv e income (loss) but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are initially recorded as an adjustment to stockholders' equity. Foreign currency translation adjustments are generally not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Cash flow hedge adjustments reflect the gains or losses on the deriv ativ e contract designated as the hedging instrument. Pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments relate to unrecognized prior serv ice credits and actuarial gains and losses. Refer to Notes 14, 15 and 18 for additional information.\n\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation-The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee serv ices receiv ed in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units ('RSUs') and performance stock units ('PSUs'), based on the fair v alue of the award as of the grant date. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight-line basis ov er the requisite serv ice period of the award, except that in the case of RSUs, compensation expense is recognized using an accelerated attribution method. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the stock-based compensation plans in which certain employees of the Company participate.\n\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans-The Company measures its pension and postretirement plans' assets and its obligations that determine the respectiv e plan's funded status as of the end of the Company's fiscal year, and recognizes an asset for a plan's ov erfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status in its balance sheet. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and reported in comprehensiv e income (loss). Refer to Note 15 for additional information on the Company's pension and postretirement plans including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, the Company's policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and the method used to estimate serv ice and interest cost components.\n\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted-In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Ow n Equity. The ASU includes amendments to the guidance on conv ertible instruments and the deriv ativ e scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity and simplifies the accounting for conv ertible instruments which include beneficial conv ersion features or cash conv ersion features by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470-20. Additionally, the ASU requires entities to use the 'if-conv erted' method when calculating diluted earnings per common share for conv ertible instruments. On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted the ASU, and the ASU did not hav e a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nIn Nov ember 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures of transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. These required disclosures include information on the nature of transactions and related accounting policies used to account for transactions, detail on the line items on the balance sheet and income statement affected by these transactions including amounts applicable to each line, and significant terms and conditions of the transactions including commitments and contingencies. The Company prospectively adopted the ASU effectiv e January 1, 2022 and applied the disclosure guidance to all transactions within the scope of the ASU that were reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into subsequent to the date of initial application. The Company accounts for the gov ernment assistance transactions by analogy to the grant accounting model in International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance .\n\nThe Company receives various forms of gov ernment assistance, primarily through grants related to the dev elopment of new products and the expansion of production capacity. During 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. gov ernment, including the Biomedical Adv anced Research and Dev elopment Authority ('BARDA') within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Biotechnology businesses and the dev elopment of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing, the U.S. gov ernment has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and is being paid ov er periods ranging from one year to four years. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded amounts related to these grants and other government assistance that offset operating expenses of $43 million, $51 million and $49 million, respectiv ely, and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $198 million, $136 million and $87 million, respectiv ely. Property, plant and equipment purchased using funds prov ided by gov ernments are recorded net of gov ernment assistance.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Danaher Corporation's exposure to state-level pricing and marketing reporting laws has increased as more jurisdictions have adopted or considered transparency laws governing interactions with healthcare professionals. In 2022, the company noted that 'an increasing number of countries either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.' By 2023, this trend continued, with the company reiterating the same language, signaling ongoing regulatory expansion. In 2024, the company again used the same phrase, suggesting a sustained and growing compliance burden due to the proliferation of these laws across U.S. states and international jurisdictions. This progression reflects a consistent increase in regulatory scrutiny and reporting obligations related to marketing and pricing practices over the three-year period.",

Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers. Further, there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\n\nFor a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Healthcare Reform\n\nIn the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in the United States, in March 2010, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act) (collectively, the 'PPACA') was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future.\n\nMoreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\n\n## Data Privacy and Security Laws\n\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, HIPAA privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy Act ('CCPA'), which came into effect in January 2020 has some of the same features as the GDPR (discussed below), and has already prompted several other states to enact or consider enacting similar laws. The EU General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018 ('GDPR') has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities with significant fines for non-compliance. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. For a discussion of risks related to these laws, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'",

      "question": "How did Danaher's microscopy product offerings evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of integration with digital pathology workflows and the expansion of imaging instrumentation capabilities?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Danaher's microscopy product offerings expanded significantly in scope and integration capabilities within digital pathology workflows. In 2022, microscopy was embedded within the broader pathology diagnostics suite, which included slide scanners, microscopes, and cameras, and was positioned as part of a comprehensive workflow solution alongside tissue processing and staining instruments. By 2023, the company had elevated microscopy into a standalone business unit, highlighting professional microscopes for research, medical, and surgical applications, including confocal, compound, and stereo microscopes. This shift indicated a strategic emphasis on microscopy as a distinct and critical offering. In 2024, the pathology diagnostics business continued to integrate microscopes with digital imaging software solutions, reinforcing the trend toward digital pathology and the need for enhanced image storage, sharing, and analysis. The evolution from a component of pathology diagnostics to a specialized product line with advanced imaging capabilities demonstrates Danaher's strategic investment in microscopy as a core life sciences and diagnostic tool.",

Prices of oil and gas also affect the Company's costs for freight and utilities and hav e an indirect impact on the cost of other purchased materials. The Company purchases raw materials from a large number of sources around the world. No single supplier is material to the Company. For some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications only a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers can readily prov ide such components. The Company utilizes a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to its supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternativ e materials and qualification of multiple supply sources.\n\nDuring 2024, there were no material effects on the business related to the av ailability of raw materials. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for the Company's operations, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe Company owns numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate the Company's intellectual property is important to its operations, the Company does not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license (or any related group of any such items) to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time the Company engages in litigation to protect its intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to the Company's intellectual property, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.' All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, Danaher.",

      "question": "How did Pfizer's treatment and valuation of Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of grant activity, valuation methodology, and disclosure transparency?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Pfizer's treatment of Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) underwent a notable evolution. In 2022, BPAs were actively granted, with 1,165 thousand shares awarded at a weighted average intrinsic value of $38.73 per share, and 859 thousand shares remained nonvested by year-end. By 2023, Pfizer disclosed that no BPAs were granted and none were outstanding as of December 31, 2023, indicating a pause or discontinuation of the program. In 2024, BPAs reappeared in disclosures, with detailed valuation and amortization policies introduced, including the use of intrinsic value at the grant date and adjustments based on performance probability and stock price changes. This 3-year trajectory suggests a strategic shift in how Pfizer structured and communicated its BPA program, moving from active issuance to suspension and then to a more transparent and dynamic valuation framework.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2023) \u2192 [BPAs]: No BPAs were granted in 2023 and none were outstanding as of December 31, 2023, indicating a suspension or discontinuation of the program.",

      "question": "How did Pfizer's relationship with Meridian evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of financial implications and ongoing contractual arrangements post-sale?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer disclosed that Meridian was part of discontinued operations following its sale on December 31, 2021, with the company recognizing a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax. Interim transition service agreements (TSAs) and a three-year Manufacturing Supply Agreement (MSA) were in place to support the post-sale relationship. By 2023, services under the TSAs were completed as of December 31, 2023, and amounts recorded under the MSA were not material to Pfizer's operations. In 2024, Meridian was referenced in Pfizer's glossary as 'Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.,' indicating continued recognition of the entity, likely due to the ongoing MSA, which had a two-year extension option beyond the initial three-year term. This trajectory shows a transition from a direct ownership relationship to a limited but structured supplier relationship, with financial impacts diminishing over time.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2023) \u2192 [Meridian]: Disclosed completion of TSAs and ongoing MSA with Meridian; sale occurred in 2021 with a $167 million loss, and MSA continued into 2023.",
        "Hop 2: [PFE](2024) \u2192 [Meridian]: Meridian was formally defined in the glossary as Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc., indicating continued recognition and likely ongoing MSA relationship.",

At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nOur Biopharma business includes the following therapeutic areas and key products:\n\n",

      "question": "How did Xtandi's revenue pressures in 2023 influence Pfizer's investment in its lifecycle management, as evidenced by the 2024 indication expansion and the 2022 valuation of the asset within Pfizer's intangible portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Xtandi was explicitly listed among Pfizer's most significant developed technology rights, indicating its importance to the company's oncology portfolio and intangible asset base. By 2023, Xtandi faced declining international revenues and downward pressure on net pricing, with revenues described as 'down 1%'\u2014a sign of intensifying market challenges. In response, Pfizer pursued lifecycle management strategies, culminating in 2024 with the approval of Xtandi for a new indication\u2014non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) with biochemical recurrence at high risk for metastasis. This expansion suggests that Pfizer actively invested in extending Xtandi's commercial life and value despite short-term revenue pressures, leveraging the asset strategically within its oncology pipeline to offset declining performance in existing markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PFE](2023) \u2192 [Xtandi]: Xtandi's revenue declined by 1% globally, driven by lower net pricing due to unfavorable channel mix, signaling early signs of market pressure.",
        "Hop 2: [PFE](2024) \u2192 [Xtandi]: Xtandi received a new FDA-approved indication for nmCSPC with high-risk biochemical recurrence, indicating a strategic lifecycle extension to maintain long-term value.",
        "Hop 3: [PFE](2022) \u2192 [Xtandi]: Xtandi was listed among Pfizer\u2019s most significant developed technology rights, underscoring its strategic and financial value to the company\u2019s oncology portfolio even before revenue pressures emerged."

          "chunk_text": "\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount primarily reflects $500 million of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. (a)\n\nThe decrease is primarily due to amortization, partially offset by the capitalization of the Comirnaty milestones described above. (b)\n\n## Developed Technology Rights\n\nDeveloped technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\n\n## Brands\n\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\n\n## IPR&amp;D\n\nIPR&amp;D assets represent R&amp;D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

      "question": "How did Abbott's documentation and disclosure strategy for its 4.75% Senior Notes due 2043 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression suggest about its long-term debt management and investor communication priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott referenced the 4.75% Senior Notes due 2043 within the context of St. Jude Medical\u2019s Fourth Supplemental Indenture from April 2, 2013, indicating legacy integration of the notes into its broader debt structure. By 2023, Abbott formalized the documentation by including the Form of 4.75% Notes due 2043 as Exhibit 4.6 to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 22, 2017, signaling a more direct and current presentation. In 2024, the company maintained this structured disclosure, reaffirming the inclusion of the 4.75% Notes due 2043 in its core indenture framework, showing consistency in long-term debt communication. This evolution reflects a shift from legacy-based referencing to a standardized, transparent disclosure approach, aligning with investor expectations for clarity in long-term liabilities.",

      "question": "How did Abbott Laboratories' unfunded commitments to private real estate funds evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's long-term investment strategy in illiquid alternative assets?",
      "answer": "Abbott Laboratories' unfunded commitments to private real estate funds decreased from $585 million in 2022 to $555 million in 2023, and further declined to $540 million in 2024. This represents a consistent downward trend of $15 million over the three-year period, indicating a gradual reduction in exposure to illiquid alternative investments. Despite this decline, the company maintained a significant unfunded commitment, suggesting a strategic but measured approach to private real estate investments, with continued long-term participation through fund distributions rather than active capital deployment.",

        "Hop 1: [ABT](2023) \u2192 [Private Real Estate Funds]: Unfunded commitment stood at $555 million as of December 31, 2023, down from $585 million in 2022.",

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nEquities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV  is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per week or month, with a required 2 to 30 day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption  of  an  investment  is  allowed.  Fix ed  income  securities  that  are  valued  using  significant  other  observable  inputs  are  valued  at  prices  obtained  from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV  provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 60 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily.\n\nAbsolute return funds are valued at the NAV  provided by the fund administrator. Abbott did  not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 90 days. For approximately $300 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 25 percent gate and $60 million is subject to a lock until  2025. All private funds are valued at the NAV  provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2025 to 2034. Abbott's unfunded commitment in these funds was $540 million and $555 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fix ed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fix ed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans' assets. Abbott's medical and dental plans' assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company's targeted asset allocation percentages.",

Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2022 to 2031.

Abbott's medical and dental plans' assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company's targeted asset allocation percentages.\n\nThe plans' expected return on assets, as shown above is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates  of  return  to  be  achieved  by  the  underlying  investment  portfolios.  In  establishing  this  assumption,  management considers  historical  and  expected  returns  for  the  asset  classes  in  which  the  plans  are  invested,  as  well  as  current economic and capital market conditions.\n\nAbbott  funds  its  domestic  pension  plans  according  to  IRS  funding  limitations.  International  pension  plans  are funded  according  to  similar  regulations. Abbott  funded  $418  million  in  2021  and  $400  million  in  2020  to  defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $415 million to its pension plans in 2022.",

      "question": "How has Abbott Laboratories' disclosure around the 2.950% Note due 2025 evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its inclusion in exhibit filings and associated documentation across these years?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Abbott Laboratories consistently disclosed the 2.950% Note due 2025 as part of its exhibit filings, showing a stable inclusion pattern. In 2022, the note was referenced as Exhibit 99.6 in the 8-K filing dated March 5, 2015. In 2023 and 2024, the same exhibit and filing date were reiterated, indicating no change in the documentation or structure of the note over the three-year period. This consistency suggests that the 2.950% Note due 2025 remained a static financial instrument in Abbott's capital structure with no amendments or refinancing actions taken.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott's 10-K filing referenced the 2.000% Senior Notes due 2018 as part of St. Jude Medical's historical debt structure under a Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated September 23, 2015, showing continued documentation of legacy obligations post-acquisition. By 2023, Abbott had incorporated these notes into broader documentation frameworks, as evidenced by the inclusion of the 2.000% Notes due 2018 in an Officers' Certificate Pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.3 of the Indenture alongside newer notes like the 2.800% Notes due 2020 and 3.25% Notes due 2023. In 2024, the 10-K filing maintained this integrated approach, continuing to document the 2.000% Senior Notes due 2018 alongside newer instruments, indicating a consistent strategy of managing legacy debt within updated capital structures. This progression shows Abbott's systematic approach to incorporating acquired debt instruments into its ongoing financial reporting and strategic capital planning.",

      "question": "How did Abbott's investment in diagnostics instruments leased to customers evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's capital deployment strategy in its diagnostics business?",
      "answer": "Abbott's net book value of diagnostics instruments leased to customers increased steadily from $1.4 billion in 2022 to $1.6 billion in 2023, and remained at $1.6 billion in 2024, while the original cost of these leased assets rose from $3.3 billion in 2022 to $3.6 billion in 2023 and reached $3.9 billion in 2024. This consistent growth in leased diagnostics instruments over the three-year period suggests a strategic emphasis on expanding access to diagnostic equipment through leasing, likely to drive downstream reagent and consumables sales, which are tied to the performance obligations in these lease arrangements.",

Operating  lease  revenue  represented  less  than  3  percent  of Abbott's  total  net  sales  in  the  years  ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nAssets related  to  operating  leases  are  reported  within  Net  property  and  equipment  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $3.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $3.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Note 11 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  primarily  for  anticipated  intercompany  purchases  by  those  subsidiaries  whose functional  currencies  are  not  the  U.S.  dollar.  These  contracts,  with  gross  notional  amounts  totaling  $8.6  billion  at December 31, 2021, and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months.\n\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the  receivable  or  payable  is  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the  entity.  For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held gross  notional  amounts  of  $12.2  billion  and  $11.0  billion,  respectively,  of  such  foreign  currency  forward  exchange contracts.\n\nIn November 2019, Abbott borrowed \u00a559.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan  as  a  hedge  of  the  net  investment  in  certain  foreign  subsidiaries.  The  proceeds  equated  to  approximately  $550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $521 million and $577 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",

By 2023, Abbott explicitly included the 4.75% Notes due 2043 in its Exhibit Table as part of its broader debt framework, indicating formal integration into Abbott's consolidated debt disclosures. In 2024, the Notes remained a consistent feature in Abbott's filings, reaffirming their ongoing role in the company's long-term debt portfolio and showing continuity in how Abbott reports legacy St. Jude Medical obligations under its current financial structure.",

      "question": "How did Abbott Laboratories' unfunded commitments to private real estate funds evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's pension fund strategy in illiquid alternative assets?",
      "answer": "Abbott Laboratories' unfunded commitments to private real estate funds decreased from $585 million in 2022 to $555 million in 2023, and further declined to $540 million by 2024. This consistent reduction over three years indicates a measured de-risking or rebalancing of the pension fund portfolio, suggesting a strategic shift away from illiquid alternative assets toward more liquid or stable investments. Despite this decline, the company maintained a long time horizon for fund liquidation (projected through 2034 by 2024), indicating continued belief in the long-term value of these assets, albeit with a reduced exposure. The gradual nature of the decline suggests a deliberate approach to managing liquidity risk and aligning fund commitments with pension liability profiles.",

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nEquities  that  are  valued  using  quoted  prices  are  valued  at  the  published  market  prices.  Equities  in  a  common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds,  investments  may  be  redeemed  once  per  week  or  month,  with  a  required  2  to  30  day  notice  period.  For  the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 14 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily.\n\nAbsolute return funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided  by  the  fund  on  a  one-quarter  lag  adjusted  for  known  cash  flows  and  significant  events  through  the reporting date. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 90 days. For approximately $290 million and $150 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 33 percent gate and a 25 percent gate, respectively, and $50 million is subject to a lock until 2022. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2022 to 2031. Abbott's unfunded commitment in these funds was $585 million and $523 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in  the  case  of  fixed  income  securities,  maturities  and  credit  quality. The  plans  do  not  directly  hold  any  securities  of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans' assets. Abbott's medical and dental plans' assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company's targeted asset allocation percentages.\n\nThe plans' expected return on assets, as shown above is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates  of  return  to  be  achieved  by  the  underlying  investment  portfolios.  In  establishing  this  assumption,  management considers  historical  and  expected  returns  for  the  asset  classes  in  which  the  plans  are  invested,  as  well  as  current economic and capital market conditions.\n\nAbbott  funds  its  domestic  pension  plans  according  to  IRS  funding  limitations.  International  pension  plans  are funded  according  to  similar  regulations. Abbott  funded  $418  million  in  2021  and  $400  million  in  2020  to  defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $415 million to its pension plans in 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott referenced the 2.000% Senior Notes due 2018 as part of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated September 23, 2015, indicating ongoing documentation related to legacy St. Jude Medical debt. In 2023, the company continued to reference the same notes within the context of broader debt structure documentation, specifically in Exhibit 4.21, showing continuity in disclosure practices. By 2024, the 2.000% Senior Notes due 2018 were still included in the 10-K exhibit table (Exhibit 4.21), but with no new issuances or amendments noted, suggesting that the notes were likely nearing maturity without further refinancing actions taken. The consistent inclusion of the notes across all three years indicates a stable, though gradually maturing, component of Abbott's capital structure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 10 - Leases (Continued)\n\n## Leases where Abbott is the Lessor\n\nCertain  assets,  primarily  diagnostics  instruments,  are  leased  to  customers  under  contractual  arrangements  that typically  include  an  operating  or  sales-type  lease  as  well  as  performance  obligations  for  reagents  and  other consumables.  Sales-type  leases  are  not  significant.  Contract  terms  vary  by  customer  and  may  include  options  to terminate  the  contract  or  options  to  extend  the  contract.  Where  instruments  are  provided  under  operating  lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g.,  reagent)  sales.  The  allocation  of  revenue  between  the  lease  and  non-lease  components  is  based  on  standalone selling  prices.  Operating  lease  revenue  represented  less  than  3  percent  of Abbott's  total  net  sales  in  the  years  ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nAssets related  to  operating  leases  are  reported  within  Net  property  and  equipment  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $3.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $3.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Note 11 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  primarily  for  anticipated  intercompany  purchases  by  those  subsidiaries  whose functional  currencies  are  not  the  U.S.  dollar.  These  contracts,  with  gross  notional  amounts  totaling  $8.6  billion  at December 31, 2021, and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months.\n\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the  receivable  or  payable  is  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the  entity.  For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held gross  notional  amounts  of  $12.2  billion  and  $11.0  billion,  respectively,  of  such  foreign  currency  forward  exchange contracts.\n\nIn November 2019, Abbott borrowed \u00a559.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan  as  a  hedge  of  the  net  investment  in  certain  foreign  subsidiaries.  The  proceeds  equated  to  approximately  $550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $521 million and $577 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",

Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales.

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Johnson & Johnson's strategy around talc-related liabilities shifted from creating a dedicated liability entity (LTL Management LLC) and establishing a $2 billion trust to a more complex legal maneuvering involving multiple bankruptcy filings and appeals. In 2022, JNJ had already established a $2 billion reserve to fund a trust for LTL to address talc claims, while litigation was stayed due to LTL\u2019s Chapter 11 filing. By 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the bankruptcy court's decision, leading to the dismissal of the initial LTL bankruptcy and the lifting of the stay, prompting LTL to refile (LTL 2), which was also dismissed later that year. In 2024, despite reaching multi-state settlements, the company remained engaged in appellate efforts to uphold the bankruptcy protection for talc claims, showing a continued reliance on the LTL structure to manage liability exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion as of January 2, 2022. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company's rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management's estimates.\n\n## Litigation Contingencies - Talc\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management's confidence in the safety of the Company's talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson &amp; Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.",

To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\n\n## Matters concerning talc\n\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the Company and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder.\n\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the M issouri Court of A ppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (M o. A pp.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. A n application for transfer of the case to the M issouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company's confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\n\nIn June 2014, the M ississippi A ttorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the M ississippi Consumer Protection A ct by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\n\nIn January 2020, the State of New M exico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\n\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company's marketing of its talcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state A ttorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements were finalized.\n\nIn October 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). A s a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL M anagement LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A &amp;M  LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RA M ); and (c) the Debtor's direct parent, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI's assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any  way  to injury  or damage, or alleged injury  or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility  for, any  such damage or injury , ex cept for any  liabilities for which the ex clusiv e remedy is provided under a workers' compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\n\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company's confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). A ll litigation against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in M arch 2022.\n\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\n\n94",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's financial commitment to its 2.250% Notes due 2050 remained relatively stable across the three years, with a slight fluctuation in the reported value. In 2022, the company reported $983 million in value for these notes. By 2023, this figure slightly decreased to $826 million, but in 2024, it rebounded slightly to $808 million. This pattern suggests a consistent long-term debt strategy with minimal adjustments to this specific instrument over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Interventional Solutions generated $3,971 million in total sales, showing strong growth compared to previous years. In 2023, the segment expanded significantly, reaching $6,350 million in worldwide sales \u2014 a 47.7% increase from 2022 \u2014 driven by strong performance in both U.S. and international markets. By 2024, the segment was rebranded or restructured, as indicated by the note that the entity was 'previously referred to as Interventional Solutions,' and this change coincided with acquisition activity in May 2024. The financial growth trajectory suggests that the strategic repositioning in 2024 likely aimed to capitalize on the segment's strong performance and consolidate its market presence under a potentially new brand or structure.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Johnson & Johnson has consistently emphasized its multi-year enterprise-wide initiative aimed at enhancing financial shared service capabilities and standardizing financial systems. In 2022, the company described the initiative as a proactive effort to integrate, simplify, and standardize processes and systems across key functions, including finance, without being prompted by any internal control deficiencies. By 2023, the company reiterated this strategic direction, highlighting ongoing alignment and streamlining of the financial control environment in response to the initiative. In 2024, the company maintained the same narrative, underscoring continuity in its efforts and affirming that these enhancements were not reactive but rather part of a long-term plan to improve operational efficiency and control effectiveness. This consistent messaging across three years indicates a sustained strategic focus on modernizing financial infrastructure and reinforcing internal controls through process standardization.",

      "question": "How did Johnson & Johnson's pension cost components evolve from 2022 through 2024 in relation to the Retirement Value formula transition announced in 2021, and what does this progression indicate about the financial impact of the shift from the Final Average Pay formula?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Johnson & Johnson consistently disclosed the structure of its U.S. pension plans, noting that employees hired before 2015 remained under the Final Average Pay formula, while those hired after 2014 were under the Retirement Value formula. In 2021, the company announced that starting January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees will transition to the Retirement Value formula, regardless of hire date. Across 2022, 2023, and 2024, the company reported net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit retirement plans, indicating ongoing financial obligations under both formulas. The consistent mention of the 2026 transition date across all three filings shows a deliberate multi-year shift in pension strategy, with financial impacts being tracked annually through benefit cost components. This suggests a measured approach to managing long-term liabilities as the company phases out the Final Average Pay formula.",

      "answer": "The Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements referenced in Medtronic\u2019s filings show continuity in form and structure across the three years, but with a clear evolution in the underlying stock incentive plans. In 2022 (MDT_10k_2022.pdf), the agreement was tied to the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (effective December 8, 2017), as noted in Exhibit 10.45. In 2023 (MDT_10k_2023.pdf), the agreement referenced the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, consistent with 2022, indicating no change in the foundational plan despite prior amendments. In 2024 (MDT_10k_2024.pdf), the same form of agreement was used, again referencing the same Amended and Restated 2013 plan, suggesting long-term stability in the structure of these agreements. This shows that while the plan itself was amended over time, the form agreement remained consistent, reflecting a strategic choice to maintain standardized compensation instruments for non-employee directors.",

        "Hop 1: MDT(2023) \u2192 Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement: The agreement was referenced under the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, indicating continuity from prior years.",
        "Hop 2: MDT(2024) \u2192 Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement: The same form agreement was used again, showing no structural changes despite the multi-year span.",
        "Hop 3: MDT(2022) \u2192 Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement: The agreement was explicitly tied to the 2013 Plan as amended and restated effective December 8, 2017, showing the foundational reference point for the following years."

      "question": "How did Medtronic's disclosures around its Euro Deferred Shares evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does the consistent absence of issuance or outstanding balances in this category reveal about the company's capital structure strategy?",
      "answer": "Medtronic consistently disclosed in fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 that no Euro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding, despite maintaining an authorized capacity of 40 thousand shares with a par value of \u20ac1.00 per share throughout the period. This consistent absence of issuance suggests that the company has not utilized Euro Deferred Shares as part of its capital structure strategy, potentially signaling a strategic preference for other forms of equity or debt financing, or a lack of demand for this particular instrument in investor markets.",

At April 26, 2024, no A Preferred Shares were outstanding.\n\nDividends The timing, declaration, and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's ordinary shares falls within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, the Company's earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of the Company's businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.\n\nOrdinary Share Repurchase Program Shares are repurchased on occasion to support the Company's stock-based compensation programs and to return capital to shareholders. During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 25 million and 6 million shares, respectively, at an average price of $83.04 and $91.31, respectively.\n\nIn March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $6.0 billion for repurchase of the Company's ordinary shares.

At April 26, 2024, the Company had used $5.7 billion of the $11.0 billion authorized under the repurchase program, leaving approximately $5.3 billion available for future repurchases. The Company accounts for repurchases of ordinary shares using the par value method and shares repurchased are cancelled.\n\n## 12. Stock Purchase and Award Plans\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, the Company granted stock awards under the 2021 Medtronic plc Long Term Incentive Plan (2021 Plan).

At April 26, 2024, there were approximately 88 million shares available for future grants under the 2021 Plan.",

      "question": "How did Medtronic's equity compensation framework for U.S. employees under the 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of plan structure and referenced agreements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Medtronic referenced both the 2008 and 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plans, with the 2013 Plan referenced in *10.42 (Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement) and *10.54 (Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement for U.S. Employees). By 2023, the company had shifted focus exclusively to the 2013 Plan, with *10.54 and *10.59 highlighting U.S. RSU agreements, signaling a consolidation of equity compensation under the newer plan. In 2024, this trend continued with *10.54 and *10.59 still in place, but with additional emphasis on the Amended and Restated 2013 Plan as the primary vehicle for U.S. employee equity compensation. This evolution reflects a strategic shift toward standardizing equity incentives under a single, updated framework, streamlining administration and aligning compensation practices across the organization.",

      "question": "How has Medtronic's approach to valuing non-qualified stock options evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this suggest about the company's changing assumptions around stock price volatility and equity compensation risk modeling?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Medtronic consistently used the Black-Scholes model to value non-qualified stock options, but the company's disclosure around expected volatility evolved. In 2022, the company based expected volatility solely on a blend of historical and implied volatility. By 2023, Medtronic explicitly noted that implied volatility was derived from market-traded options, adding transparency to the forward-looking component of the assumption. This clarification was maintained in 2024, suggesting a more refined and market-informed approach to volatility estimation. This evolution indicates a shift toward more dynamic risk modeling in equity compensation, aligning with market behavior and potentially improving the accuracy of compensation expense recognition.",

The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The liabilities and costs associated with the company's postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis and are not material for any period presented.\n\nThe company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.\n\nWhen a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.\n\nThe company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company made cash contributions of approximately $34 million, $96 million and $50 million, respectively.

      "answer": "TMO's allocation to U.S. equity funds in its domestic pension plans decreased from $125 million in 2022 to $89 million in 2023, and slightly increased to $93 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a cautious reduction in exposure to U.S. equities over the three-year period, with a modest rebound in 2024, suggesting a strategic rebalancing rather than a complete divestiture.",

      "question": "Given TMO's consistent $700 million carrying value in the 1.750% 7-Year Senior Notes from 2022 through 2024, how has the company's treatment of this fixed-rate debt instrument reflected its strategy for managing interest rate risk within its capital structure?",
      "answer": "TMO maintained the 1.750% 7-Year Senior Notes at a consistent $700 million carrying value in 2022, 2023, and 2024, with an unchanging effective interest rate of 1.89% throughout the period. This static positioning of a fixed-rate instrument suggests a deliberate strategy to preserve a stable interest expense profile amid potentially rising rates observed in other variable-rate instruments. By not refinancing or retiring this note early, TMO appears to be anchoring its capital structure with predictable long-term financing costs, which could signal confidence in long-term cash flow stability and a defensive posture against interest rate volatility.",

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## 401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe company's 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company's eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company charged to expense $299 million, $254 million and $232 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nEmployees of a number of the company's non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The liabilities and costs associated with the company's postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis and are not material for any period presented.\n\nThe company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.\n\nWhen a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.\n\nThe company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company made cash contributions of approximately $34 million, $96 million and $50 million, respectively. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $40 and $60 million for 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Thermo Fisher Scientific disclosed the Executive Change In Control Retention Agreement specifically for Marc N. Casper and a form for officers other than Marc N. Casper, dated March 16, 2018. By 2023, the company filed a new form of the agreement for officers other than Marc N. Casper, dated April 1, 2023, indicating an update or revision to the structure or terms of these agreements. In 2024, the company reaffirmed the existence of these agreements for officers beyond Casper, reiterating the form filed in 2023, suggesting a formalization or continuation of the updated terms. This progression shows a deliberate evolution in the company\u2019s executive retention strategy, expanding beyond the CEO to broader leadership.",

      "question": "How has Dificid's role and performance evolved across Merck's Hospital Acute Care portfolio from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic priorities in antibiotic therapies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Dificid demonstrated a consistent presence in Merck's Hospital Acute Care portfolio, with its financial and strategic positioning evolving subtly over time. In 2022, Dificid was listed among key intangible assets under human health marketed products, carrying a net value of $145 million, indicating its importance as an established treatment for *C. difficile*-associated diarrhea. By 2023, Dificid was explicitly named in the product listing under Hospital Acute Care, confirming its operational integration and therapeutic relevance in the company\u2019s acute care strategy. In 2024, Dificid generated $340 million in total sales globally (including $303 million in the U.S. and $37 million internationally), showing steady demand and reinforcing its role in Merck\u2019s anti-infective portfolio. The consistent recognition of Dificid across three years\u2014first as a valuable intangible asset, then as a named therapeutic product, and finally as a revenue contributor\u2014suggests that Merck has maintained a strategic focus on antibiotic therapies, particularly in hospital settings, despite the competitive and evolving landscape of infectious disease treatment.",

Some of the more significant acquired intangibles, on a net basis, related to human health marketed products (included  in  products  and  product  rights  above)  at  December  31,  2021  include Reblozyl ,  $3.8  billion; Zerbaxa ,  $478  million; Gardasil/Gardasil 9, $191 million; Bridion , $145 million; Dificid , $145 million; Sivextro , $138 million; and Simponi , $101 million. Additionally, the Company had $5.0 billion of net acquired intangibles related to animal health marketed products at December 31, 2021,  of  which  $2.3  billion  relate  primarily  to  trade  names  obtained  through  the  2019  acquisition  of Antelliq  (see  Note  4). At December 31, 2021, IPR&amp;D primarily relates to MK-7962 (sotatercept), $6.4 billion, obtained through the acquisition of Acceleron in 2021 (see Note 4); MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $2.0 billion, obtained through the acquisition of ArQule in 2020 (see below and Note 4); and MK-7264 (gefapixant) $832 million, obtained through the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals in 2016. Some of the more significant net intangible assets included in licenses and other above at December 31, 2021 include Lynparza, $1.1 billion, related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca; Lenvima, $1.0 billion, related to a collaboration with Eisai; Adempas, $806 million related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer;  and  Verquvo,  $68  million,  also  related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer.  See  Note  5  for additional information related to the intangible assets associated with these collaborations.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  recorded  an  impairment  charge  of  $1.6  billion  within Cost  of  sales related  to Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for injection, a combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of certain bacterial infections. In December 2020, the Company temporarily suspended sales of Zerbaxa , and subsequently issued a product recall, following the identification of product sterility issues. The recall constituted a triggering event requiring the evaluation of the Zerbaxa intangible asset for impairment. The Company revised its cash flow forecasts for Zerbaxa utilizing certain assumptions around the return to market timeline and anticipated uptake in sales thereafter. These revised cash flow forecasts indicated that the Zerbaxa intangible  asset  value  was  not  fully  recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best  estimate  of  the  fair  value  of  the  intangible  asset  related  to Zerbaxa that,  when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above. The Company also wrote-off inventory of $120 million to Cost of sales in 2020 related to the Zerbaxa recall. A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nIn 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges related to marketed products and other intangibles of $705 million. Of this amount, $612 million related to Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate), a product for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by designated susceptible Gram-positive organisms. As part of a reorganization and reprioritization of its internal sales force, the Company made the decision to cease promotion of Sivextro in the U.S. market by the end of 2019. This decision resulted in reduced cash flow projections for Sivextro , which indicated that the Sivextro intangible asset value was not fully recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market  participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to Sivextro that, when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above.\n\nIPR&amp;D that  the  Company  acquires  through  business  combinations  represents  the  fair  value  assigned  to  incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. Amounts capitalized as IPR&amp;D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until",

      "question": "How did Merck's development and regulatory trajectory for the HIV-1 treatment MK-8591A evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of clinical phase progression and FDA interactions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MK-8591A (doravirine+islatravir) was listed in Phase 3 development for HIV-1 infection with an entry date of February 2020. By 2023, it remained in Phase 3 and was under review, indicating no major regulatory advancements. In 2024, MK-8591A remained in development, but a new formulation, MK-8591D (islatravir+lenacapavir), entered Phase 3 in October 2024, suggesting a strategic pivot or expansion in Merck's HIV-1 treatment approach. Additionally, in 2024, the FDA lifted a clinical hold on the program, although a partial hold remained for higher doses of islatravir. This shows a multi-year trajectory of ongoing development with evolving regulatory dynamics.",

      "question": "How did Merck's development and strategic positioning of MK-1308A evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's focus in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treatment innovation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck listed MK-1308A (quavonlimab + pembrolizumab) under Phase 3 programs for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with an entry date of April 2021, indicating early-stage strategic commitment. By 2023, the company emphasized MK-1308A as part of its immuno-oncology pillar, describing it as a coformulation of quavonlimab (an anti-CTLA-4 antibody) with pembrolizumab being evaluated for RCC, signaling a deeper investment in combination immunotherapies. In 2024, MK-1308A remained a highlighted Phase 3 candidate within the immuno-oncology portfolio, specifically for RCC, with no indication of discontinuation, suggesting sustained strategic prioritization. This 3-year trajectory reflects Merck's consistent and evolving focus on leveraging its Keytruda platform in combination with novel agents like quavonlimab to innovate in RCC treatment.",

      "question": "What does the evolution of Merck's Change in Control Separation Benefits Plan from 2022 to 2024 suggest about the company's executive retention and restructuring strategy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Merck's Change in Control Separation Benefits Plan remained structurally unchanged, with no new amendments reported across the filings. In 2022, the plan was described as 'effective as amended and restated, as of January 1, 2013' (MRK_10k_2022.pdf). This same description was repeated in 2023 (MRK_10k_2023.pdf) and again in 2024 (MRK_10k_2024.pdf), indicating a consistent policy framework for executive separation benefits in the event of a change in control. Notably, in 2024, the U.S. Separation Benefits Plan was updated with new amendments (2023-1 and 2024-1), suggesting that while Merck made adjustments to broader separation policies, it maintained the 2013 version of the Change in Control plan without modification. This stability implies that Merck has preserved a long-standing structure for executive retention and change-in-control protections, even as it updated other related compensation mechanisms.",

        "Hop 2: MRK(2024) \u2192 Change in Control Separation Benefits Plan: The same 2013 effective date is reiterated, and no new amendments are noted despite updates to other plans like the U.S. Separation Benefits Plan (with 2023-1 and 2024-1 amendments).",
        "Hop 3: MRK(2022) \u2192 Change in Control Separation Benefits Plan: The plan is again described as 'effective as amended and restated, as of January 1, 2013', showing continuity from at least 2022 through 2024."

      "answer": "AbbVie's allocation to money market funds and time deposits decreased from $21 million in 2023 to $12 million in 2022 (revised downward from earlier disclosures), and further declined to $10 million in 2024. This consistent reduction over the three-year period suggests a gradual shift away from these short-term instruments, potentially reflecting a reallocation toward other cash equivalents or strategic liquidity adjustments as the company managed its balance sheet amid evolving financial obligations and contingent liabilities.",

      "question": "How did AbbVie's governance provisions related to director removal for cause evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year consistency suggest about the company's strategic posture toward takeover defenses?",
      "answer": "Across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014AbbVie consistently disclosed that stockholders may only remove directors for cause, as part of a broader set of anti-takeover provisions in its certificate of incorporation and by-laws. This provision remained unchanged over the three-year period, indicating a stable and deliberate governance strategy aimed at insulating the board from activist pressures and hostile takeovers. The persistence of this language, alongside other consistent provisions such as staggered board terms and supermajority voting requirements, suggests AbbVie's board and management intend to maintain strong control over corporate governance and strategic direction.",

These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders.

      "question": "How did ABBV's development, commercialization, and financial performance related to Vraylar evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trajectory indicate about its strategic importance in the neuroscience portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ABBV announced top-line results from two Phase 3 trials of Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), with one trial meeting its primary endpoint and the other showing numerical but not statistically significant improvement. By 2024, Vraylar was clearly established in the market as a core neuroscience product, indicated for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and as an adjunct in MDD. Financially, in 2023, Vraylar generated $2,759 million in total revenue, with a 35.4% year-over-year increase, indicating strong commercial traction. This evolution shows that Vraylar transitioned from a late-stage clinical asset in 2022 to a key revenue driver and therapeutic pillar in ABBV\u2019s neuroscience portfolio by 2024.",

      "answer": "AbbVie's allocation to money market funds and time deposits increased from $12 million in 2022 to $21 million in 2023, then decreased to $10 million in 2024. This pattern reflects a short-term liquidity strategy that initially favored slightly higher placement in low-risk instruments before retreating, even as overall cash and equivalents fluctuated significantly\u2014from $8,449 million in 2022 to $9,201 million in 2023 and then dropping to $5,524 million in 2024. The changes suggest a dynamic approach to liquidity management, adjusting exposure to money market funds in response to broader financial conditions.",

      "answer": "AbbVie consistently maintained a provision across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024) stating that stockholders may only remove directors for cause, as part of a broader set of governance mechanisms designed to deter hostile takeovers. This provision remained unchanged in each year's 10-K filing, indicating a deliberate and sustained effort to insulate the board from abrupt changes and maintain strategic continuity. The repeated emphasis on this governance structure suggests that AbbVie views director removal restrictions as a core component of its anti-takeover defense, reinforcing board stability and discouraging activist interventions.",

        "Hop 1: [ABBV](2022) \u2192 [Director Removal for Cause]: Discloses that stockholders may only remove directors for cause as part of anti-takeover provisions.",

        "Hop 3: [ABBV](2024) \u2192 [Director Removal for Cause]: Maintains the same language regarding director removal for cause, signaling long-term strategic consistency."

The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\n\nCertain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock.\n\nAbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\n- the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting;\n- the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;\n- a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n- the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and\n- the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions.\n\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock.\n\nAbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Xen has remained categorized under 'Other eye care' alongside Durysta and Refresh/Optive, indicating a consistent therapeutic positioning within AbbVie's broader eye care portfolio. In 2022, Xen was grouped with Durysta and Refresh/Optive, while key revenue-driving products like Ozurdex, Lumigan, and Restasis were highlighted separately with detailed indications and geographic availability. In 2023, the structure remained unchanged, with Xen continuing to be listed among secondary products, suggesting no significant shift in investment or commercial emphasis. By 2024, Xen maintained its placement in the 'Other eye care' category, indicating AbbVie's sustained focus on Ozurdex, Lumigan, and Restasis as core offerings while Xen remained a supporting product. This consistent categorization over three years reflects a stable strategic positioning of Xen as a complementary rather than flagship product in the eye care segment.",

Vraylar (cariprazine) is a dopamine D3-preferring D3/D2 receptor partial agonist and a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. Its D3 binding profile may be linked to observed improvements in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and to antidepressant effects in bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression). Vraylar is indicated for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults, acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adults and acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults.\n\nDuopa and Duodopa (carbidopa and levodopa).

It represents the first FDA-approved oral treatment for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in over a decade. Orilissa inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Administration results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, leading to decreased blood concentrations of ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone. Outside the United States, Orilissa is also launched in Canada. Oriahnn (elagolix, estradiol and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) is a combination prescription medicine used to control heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine fibroids in women before menopause.\n\nOther women's health.

      "question": "How did Danaher Corporation's (DHR) investment in Diagnostics Testing Technologies evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of capital expenditures and government grant utilization, and what does this progression indicate about the company's strategic focus in diagnostics?",
      "answer": "In 2022, DHR projected capital expenditures of $1.5 billion, with a significant portion allocated to increasing manufacturing capacity for diagnostic testing technologies, supported by U.S. government grants awarded in 2021 totaling $568 million. In 2023, DHR shifted from investment to production, actively developing and expanding diagnostics testing technologies with government financing playing a key role in capacity expansion. By 2024, DHR had spent $198 million of government grant funds on property, plant, and equipment for diagnostics testing technologies, up from $136 million in 2023 and $87 million in 2022, indicating a clear multi-year investment trajectory and operational scaling in diagnostics. This evolution shows that DHR's strategic focus in diagnostics has moved from initial investment and planning (2022) to active production expansion (2023) and then to capital-intensive scaling supported by government partnerships (2024).",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing manufacturing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company's businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and $791 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2021 was primarily due to incremental capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity for diagnostic testing and biopharma products (including to address increased COVID-19 related demand) as well as incremental capital expenditures as a result of the Cytiva and Aldevron Acquisitions. In 2022, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year to increase manufacturing capacity primarily to support customer demand for products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and other growth opportunities. The Company estimates capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including BARDA, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Life Sciences businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one to four years. In 2021, the Company received aggregate payments related to government grants of $73 million that offset operating expenses and capital expenditures of $41 million and $32 million, respectively.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.3 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $1.0 billion of cash provided during 2020. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to cash provided in 2021 from the issuance of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Aldevron Acquisition and the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by cash provided by the sale of common and preferred stock and borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes, as well as the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $22.2 billion and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $8 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $2.2 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company's $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has classified approximately $2.8 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, $699 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Biopharma Notes and $284 million of borrowings outstanding under the Floating Rate 2022 Euronotes as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available.\n\nUnder the Company's U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company's floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company's financial position. The U.S. dollar LIBOR-based borrowings will be available to the Company under the Five-Year Facility until 2023, upon the discontinuance of LIBOR. Prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company expects to amend the Five-Year Facility to replace LIBOR with another reference interest rate.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)-Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) refers to certain gains and losses that under GAAP are included in comprehensiv e income (loss) but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are initially recorded as an adjustment to stockholders' equity. Foreign currency translation adjustments are generally not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Cash flow hedge adjustments reflect the gains or losses on the deriv ativ e contract designated as the hedging instrument. Pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments relate to unrecognized prior serv ice credits and actuarial gains and losses. Refer to Notes 14, 15 and 18 for additional information.\n\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation-The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee serv ices receiv ed in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units ('RSUs') and performance stock units ('PSUs'), based on the fair v alue of the award as of the grant date. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight-line basis ov er the requisite serv ice period of the award, except that in the case of RSUs, compensation expense is recognized using an accelerated attribution method. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the stock-based compensation plans in which certain employees of the Company participate.\n\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans-The Company measures its pension and postretirement plans' assets and its obligations that determine the respectiv e plan's funded status as of the end of the Company's fiscal year, and recognizes an asset for a plan's ov erfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status in its balance sheet. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and reported in comprehensiv e income (loss). Refer to Note 15 for additional information on the Company's pension and postretirement plans including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, the Company's policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and the method used to estimate serv ice and interest cost components.\n\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted-In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Ow n Equity. The ASU includes amendments to the guidance on conv ertible instruments and the deriv ativ e scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity and simplifies the accounting for conv ertible instruments which include beneficial conv ersion features or cash conv ersion features by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470-20. Additionally, the ASU requires entities to use the 'if-conv erted' method when calculating diluted earnings per common share for conv ertible instruments. On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted the ASU, and the ASU did not hav e a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nIn Nov ember 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures of transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. These required disclosures include information on the nature of transactions and related accounting policies used to account for transactions, detail on the line items on the balance sheet and income statement affected by these transactions including amounts applicable to each line, and significant terms and conditions of the transactions including commitments and contingencies. The Company prospectively adopted the ASU effectiv e January 1, 2022 and applied the disclosure guidance to all transactions within the scope of the ASU that were reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into subsequent to the date of initial application. The Company accounts for the gov ernment assistance transactions by analogy to the grant accounting model in International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance .\n\nThe Company receives various forms of gov ernment assistance, primarily through grants related to the dev elopment of new products and the expansion of production capacity. During 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. gov ernment, including the Biomedical Adv anced Research and Dev elopment Authority ('BARDA') within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Biotechnology businesses and the dev elopment of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing, the U.S. gov ernment has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and is being paid ov er periods ranging from one year to four years. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded amounts related to these grants and other government assistance that offset operating expenses of $43 million, $51 million and $49 million, respectiv ely, and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $198 million, $136 million and $87 million, respectiv ely. Property, plant and equipment purchased using funds prov ided by gov ernments are recorded net of gov ernment assistance.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the scope of state-level pricing and marketing reporting laws affecting DHR expanded, with increasing numbers of jurisdictions adopting similar transparency mandates. In 2022, DHR noted that several U.S. states had enacted laws requiring manufacturers to file reports tracking gifts and other remuneration provided to healthcare professionals and entities. By 2023, the company observed an 'increasing number of countries' adopting similar laws, indicating a growing global trend. In 2024, DHR specifically cited the Open Payments Act and emphasized that an increasing number of countries and U.S. states had either adopted or were considering such laws, with expanded definitions of remuneration including ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. This progression shows a broadening in both the geographic reach and the depth of reporting obligations under these laws.",

          "chunk_text": "countries either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals.\n\nIn addition, some of the in vitro diagnostic drugs-of-abuse assays and reagents sold by the Company's subsidiaries contain small amounts of controlled substances, and as a result some of the Company's facilities are inspected periodically by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to assess whether the Company properly handles, stores and disposes of controlled substances in the manufacture of those products.\n\nFederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers. Further, there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\n\nFor a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Healthcare Reform\n\nIn the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in the United States, in March 2010, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act) (collectively, the 'PPACA') was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future.\n\nMoreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\n\n## Data Privacy and Security Laws\n\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, HIPAA privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy Act ('CCPA'), which came into effect in January 2020 has some of the same features as the GDPR (discussed below), and has already prompted several other states to enact or consider enacting similar laws. The EU General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018 ('GDPR') has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities with significant fines for non-compliance. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. For a discussion of risks related to these laws, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'",

Similar reporting requirements hav e also been enacted on the state lev el, and an increasing number of countries either hav e adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.\n\nIn addition, some of the in v itro diagnostic drugs-of-abuse assays and reagents sold by the Company's subsidiaries contain small amounts of controlled substances, and as a result some of the Company's facilities are inspected periodically by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to assess whether the Company properly handles, stores and disposes of controlled substances in the manufacture of those products.\n\nFederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activ ities and activ ities that potentially harm consumers. Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims inv olv ing healthcare items or serv ices reimbursed by any third-party payor, including priv ate insurers. Further, there are state laws that require medical dev ice manufacturers to comply with the v oluntary compliance guidelines and the relev ant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal gov ernment, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare prov iders and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of v alue prov ided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representativ es; and state laws gov erning the priv acy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\n\nFor a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Healthcare Reform\n\nIn the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, there hav e been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislativ e and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in the United States, in March 2010, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act) (collectiv ely, the 'PPACA') was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both gov ernmental and priv ate insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry. Since its enactment, there hav e been judicial, Congressional and executiv e challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future.\n\nMoreover, there has recently been heightened gov ernmental scrutiny ov er the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in sev eral Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, rev iew the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform gov ernment program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Indiv idual states in the U.S. hav e also become increasingly activ e in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Other countries, including China, hav e also introduced similar measures with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improv ing quality and/or expanding access.\n\n## Data Privacy and Security Law s\n\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data priv acy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of hav ing access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitiv e data in the course of our business. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') imposes significant restrictions on how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to superv isory authorities with significant fines for non-compliance. In the U.S., HIPAA priv acy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the av ailability and confidentiality of patient health information, indiv idual states regulate data breach and security requirements, and multiple gov ernmental bodies assert authority ov er aspects of the protection of personal priv acy. State priv acy laws in California impose some of the same features as the GDPR and hav e prompted an",

      "question": "How did Danaher's strategic positioning of its microscopy product line evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what implications does this repositioning have for its digital pathology market differentiation and revenue potential?",
      "answer": "In 2022, microscopy was embedded within the broader pathology diagnostics business, described alongside tissue slicing and staining instruments, with no distinct mention of digital integration. In 2023, microscopy was elevated to a standalone business unit under Life Sciences, explicitly highlighting digital capabilities like image capture and analysis, and was marketed under the LEICA MICROSYSTEMS brand. By 2024, microscopy was further integrated with digital pathology software solutions, indicating a strategic shift toward end-to-end digital workflow enablement. This evolution suggests a deliberate effort to position Danaher as a leader in digital pathology, enhancing both product differentiation and the potential for higher-margin software and integrated system sales.",

Prices of oil and gas also affect the Company's costs for freight and utilities and hav e an indirect impact on the cost of other purchased materials. The Company purchases raw materials from a large number of sources around the world. No single supplier is material to the Company. For some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications only a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers can readily prov ide such components. The Company utilizes a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to its supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternativ e materials and qualification of multiple supply sources.\n\nDuring 2024, there were no material effects on the business related to the av ailability of raw materials. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for the Company's operations, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe Company owns numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate the Company's intellectual property is important to its operations, the Company does not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license (or any related group of any such items) to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time the Company engages in litigation to protect its intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to the Company's intellectual property, refer to 'Item 1A.

      "question": "How did Abbott's unfunded commitments to private real estate funds evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's long-term investment strategy in illiquid alternative assets?",
      "answer": "Abbott's unfunded commitments to private real estate funds decreased from $569 million in 2022 to $555 million in 2023, and further declined to $540 million in 2024. This represents a consistent downward trend of $15 million per year over the three-year period. The gradual reduction in unfunded commitments suggests a strategic de-risking or rebalancing away from illiquid alternative assets, even as Abbott continues to maintain exposure to private real estate through existing investments. The liquidation periods for these funds remained long-term (2025\u20132034 by 2024), indicating that Abbott is not exiting the space entirely but is managing its exposure more cautiously.",

Equities  in  a  common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator.

For  the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 14 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily.\n\nAbsolute return funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided  by  the  fund  on  a  one-quarter  lag  adjusted  for  known  cash  flows  and  significant  events  through  the reporting date. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 90 days. For approximately $290 million and $150 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 33 percent gate and a 25 percent gate, respectively, and $50 million is subject to a lock until 2022. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2022 to 2031. Abbott's unfunded commitment in these funds was $585 million and $523 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in  the  case  of  fixed  income  securities,  maturities  and  credit  quality. The  plans  do  not  directly  hold  any  securities  of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans' assets. Abbott's medical and dental plans' assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company's targeted asset allocation percentages.\n\nThe plans' expected return on assets, as shown above is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates  of  return  to  be  achieved  by  the  underlying  investment  portfolios.  In  establishing  this  assumption,  management considers  historical  and  expected  returns  for  the  asset  classes  in  which  the  plans  are  invested,  as  well  as  current economic and capital market conditions.\n\nAbbott  funds  its  domestic  pension  plans  according  to  IRS  funding  limitations.  International  pension  plans  are funded  according  to  similar  regulations. Abbott  funded  $418  million  in  2021  and  $400  million  in  2020  to  defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $415 million to its pension plans in 2022.",

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nEquities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV  is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per week or month, with a required 2 to 30 day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption  of  an  investment  is  allowed.  Fix ed  income  securities  that  are  valued  using  significant  other  observable  inputs  are  valued  at  prices  obtained  from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV  provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 60 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily.\n\nAbsolute return funds are valued at the NAV  provided by the fund administrator. Abbott did  not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 90 days. For approximately $300 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 25 percent gate and $60 million is subject to a lock until  2025. All private funds are valued at the NAV  provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2025 to 2034. Abbott's unfunded commitment in these funds was $540 million and $555 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fix ed income securities.

      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott's 10-K filing included the 2.950% Note due 2025 as Exhibit 99.6, filed as part of the March 5, 2015 Current Report on Form 8-K. By 2023, the note remained listed in the 10-K exhibit table as Item 4.10, maintaining its reference to the same filing date and exhibit number. In 2024, the 2.950% Note due 2025 continued to be referenced in the 10-K exhibit table (Item 4.10) with identical documentation details, showing no substantive change in how the obligation was presented over the three-year period.

      "question": "What does Abbott Laboratories' continued reference to the 2.000% Senior Notes due 2018 across its 10-K filings from 2022 to 2024 indicate about its approach to legacy St. Jude Medical debt and overall debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "The continued reference to the 2.000% Senior Notes due 2018 in Abbott\u2019s 10-K filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024 indicates that the company maintained transparency and consistency in disclosing legacy St. Jude Medical debt obligations. In 2022, the notes were explicitly listed in Exhibit 4.23, filed under St. Jude Medical, Inc.'s 2015 Current Report on Form 8-K. In 2023, Abbott again detailed these notes in Exhibit 4.18, reaffirming their inclusion within the broader debt structure and linking them to other St. Jude Medical senior notes. By 2024, the notes remained part of the Exhibit Table (Item 4.21), showing that Abbott continued to integrate and track this legacy obligation within its consolidated debt disclosures. This consistent documentation suggests that Abbott has taken a methodical and transparent approach to managing legacy St. Jude Medical liabilities, ensuring continuity in investor communication and regulatory reporting.",

      "question": "How did Abbott's investment in diagnostics instruments leased to customers evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the trend in net book value reveal about the company's capital deployment strategy in its diagnostics business?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott reported a net book value of $1.4 billion for diagnostics instruments leased to customers. By 2023, this figure increased to $1.6 billion, and in 2024, it remained steady at $1.6 billion as well. This indicates a gradual increase in Abbott's capital investment in diagnostics instruments over the two-year period, followed by stabilization in 2024. The trend suggests a strategic ramp-up in deploying diagnostics instruments to support customer leasing arrangements, aligning with Abbott\u2019s broader focus on diagnostics and consumables-based revenue streams.",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 10 - Leases (Continued)\n\n## Leases where Abbott is the Lessor\n\nCertain  assets,  primarily  diagnostics  instruments,  are  leased  to  customers  under  contractual  arrangements  that typically  include  an  operating  or  sales-type  lease  as  well  as  performance  obligations  for  reagents  and  other consumables.  Sales-type  leases  are  not  significant.  Contract  terms  vary  by  customer  and  may  include  options  to terminate  the  contract  or  options  to  extend  the  contract.  Where  instruments  are  provided  under  operating  lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g.,  reagent)  sales.  The  allocation  of  revenue  between  the  lease  and  non-lease  components  is  based  on  standalone selling  prices.  Operating  lease  revenue  represented  less  than  3  percent  of Abbott's  total  net  sales  in  the  years  ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nAssets related  to  operating  leases  are  reported  within  Net  property  and  equipment  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $3.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $3.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Note 11 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  primarily  for  anticipated  intercompany  purchases  by  those  subsidiaries  whose functional  currencies  are  not  the  U.S.  dollar.  These  contracts,  with  gross  notional  amounts  totaling  $8.6  billion  at December 31, 2021, and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months.\n\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the  receivable  or  payable  is  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the  entity.  For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held gross  notional  amounts  of  $12.2  billion  and  $11.0  billion,  respectively,  of  such  foreign  currency  forward  exchange contracts.\n\nIn November 2019, Abbott borrowed \u00a559.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan  as  a  hedge  of  the  net  investment  in  certain  foreign  subsidiaries.  The  proceeds  equated  to  approximately  $550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $521 million and $577 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",

      "answer": "Thermo Fisher Scientific's defined contribution plan expenses increased from $402 million in 2022 to $468 million in 2023, followed by a decrease to $443 million in 2024. This pattern reflects a year-over-year increase of 16.4% between 2022 and 2023, followed by a 5.3% decline from 2023 to 2024. The rise in 2023 may indicate a temporary increase in company contributions or participation levels, while the subsequent drop in 2024 could suggest a recalibration of funding levels.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## 401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe company's 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company's eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company charged to expense $299 million, $254 million and $232 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nEmployees of a number of the company's non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The liabilities and costs associated with the company's postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis and are not material for any period presented.\n\nThe company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.\n\nWhen a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.\n\nThe company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company made cash contributions of approximately $34 million, $96 million and $50 million, respectively.

      "question": "How has TMO's outstanding value of the '1.750% 7-Year Senior Notes' evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's medium-term debt strategy in the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TMO reported $700 million in outstanding value for the 1.750% 7-Year Senior Notes due October 15, 2028. In 2023, this figure remained unchanged at $700 million. By 2024, the outstanding value of these notes was still $700 million, indicating a consistent level of medium-term debt tied to this instrument over the three-year period. This stable pattern suggests that TMO maintained a steady approach to this segment of its capital structure, without retiring or increasing the principal amount of these notes during the observed years.",

      "question": "How did Thermo Fisher Scientific's use of Executive Change in Control Retention Agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly regarding the standardization of agreements for officers beyond the CEO?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Thermo Fisher Scientific had the Executive Change In Control Retention Agreement specifically for CEO Marc N. Casper (Exhibit 10.12) with amendments dated through March 16, 2018 (Exhibit 10.17). By 2023, the company introduced a standardized Form of Executive Change in Control Retention Agreement for Officers other than Marc N. Casper (Exhibit 10.17), indicating expansion beyond just the CEO. In 2024, this standardization was reaffirmed with continued use of the form agreement for officers (Exhibit 10.17), showing a clear evolution from a CEO-specific arrangement to a standardized executive compensation practice across the organization.",

      "question": "How has Medtronic's reliance on the Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement under the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this consistency suggest about its non-employee director compensation strategy?",
      "answer": "Medtronic consistently referenced the same Form of Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement under the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan across all three reporting years (2022, 2023, and 2024), indicating a stable and deliberate approach to non-employee director compensation. In 2022, the agreement was cited in Exhibit 10.42 of the 10-K filing, and this same form was carried forward unchanged into both the 2023 and 2024 filings. This continuity suggests that Medtronic has maintained a consistent governance strategy to align long-term incentives for non-employee directors with shareholder interests, without modifying the structure or terms of this key compensation instrument over the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did Medtronic's capital structure disclosures regarding Euro Deferred Shares evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does the consistent absence of issuance against the authorized 40 thousand Euro Deferred Shares suggest about the company's financing strategy over this period?",
      "answer": "Medtronic consistently disclosed in fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 that no Euro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding, despite maintaining an authorized capacity of 40 thousand Euro Deferred Shares with a par value of \u20ac1.00 per share throughout the period. This consistent absence of issuance suggests that Medtronic did not utilize Euro Deferred Shares as a financing instrument during this time, potentially indicating a preference for other capital structure tools such as ordinary share repurchases and dividend policies to manage capital allocation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MDT](2022) \u2192 [Euro Deferred Shares]: In fiscal year 2022, Medtronic disclosed that no Euro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding, though 40 thousand were authorized.",
        "Hop 2: [MDT](2023) \u2192 [Euro Deferred Shares]: In fiscal year 2023, the company again disclosed that no Euro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding, maintaining the same 40 thousand authorized limit.",
        "Hop 3: [MDT](2024) \u2192 [Euro Deferred Shares]: In fiscal year 2024, Medtronic reiterated that no Euro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding, despite the unchanged authorization of 40 thousand shares."

      "answer": "Medtronic has not updated its U.S. employee restricted stock unit agreements from FY2022 through FY2024. In all three annual filings, the company continued to reference the same Form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (U.S. Employees) under the 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, first filed on August 27, 2013 (File No. 001-07707). The absence of modifications to this agreement across a three-year span suggests a stable and consistent equity compensation strategy for U.S. employees, indicating that Medtronic has maintained its approach to long-term incentive alignment without introducing structural changes to this particular award vehicle.",

      "question": "How did MDT's assumptions for expected volatility in its Black-Scholes model evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression suggest about the company's approach to valuing non-qualified stock options?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDT based expected volatility solely on historical volatility of its ordinary shares without incorporating implied volatility. By 2023, the company began using a blend of historical and implied volatility derived from market-traded options, signaling a more market-sensitive approach. This blended methodology was maintained in 2024, with explicit mention of reliance on market-traded options for implied volatility. The evolution from purely historical to a hybrid model suggests MDT sought to align its option valuations more closely with real-time market expectations over the three-year period.",

Some of the more significant acquired intangibles, on a net basis, related to human health marketed products (included  in  products  and  product  rights  above)  at  December  31,  2021  include Reblozyl ,  $3.8  billion; Zerbaxa ,  $478  million; Gardasil/Gardasil 9, $191 million; Bridion , $145 million; Dificid , $145 million; Sivextro , $138 million; and Simponi , $101 million. Additionally, the Company had $5.0 billion of net acquired intangibles related to animal health marketed products at December 31, 2021,  of  which  $2.3  billion  relate  primarily  to  trade  names  obtained  through  the  2019  acquisition  of Antelliq  (see  Note  4). At December 31, 2021, IPR&amp;D primarily relates to MK-7962 (sotatercept), $6.4 billion, obtained through the acquisition of Acceleron in 2021 (see Note 4); MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $2.0 billion, obtained through the acquisition of ArQule in 2020 (see below and Note 4); and MK-7264 (gefapixant) $832 million, obtained through the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals in 2016. Some of the more significant net intangible assets included in licenses and other above at December 31, 2021 include Lynparza, $1.1 billion, related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca; Lenvima, $1.0 billion, related to a collaboration with Eisai; Adempas, $806 million related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer;  and  Verquvo,  $68  million,  also  related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer.  See  Note  5  for additional information related to the intangible assets associated with these collaborations.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  recorded  an  impairment  charge  of  $1.6  billion  within Cost  of  sales related  to Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for injection, a combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of certain bacterial infections. In December 2020, the Company temporarily suspended sales of Zerbaxa , and subsequently issued a product recall, following the identification of product sterility issues. The recall constituted a triggering event requiring the evaluation of the Zerbaxa intangible asset for impairment. The Company revised its cash flow forecasts for Zerbaxa utilizing certain assumptions around the return to market timeline and anticipated uptake in sales thereafter. These revised cash flow forecasts indicated that the Zerbaxa intangible  asset  value  was  not  fully  recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best  estimate  of  the  fair  value  of  the  intangible  asset  related  to Zerbaxa that,  when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above. The Company also wrote-off inventory of $120 million to Cost of sales in 2020 related to the Zerbaxa recall. A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nIn 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges related to marketed products and other intangibles of $705 million. Of this amount, $612 million related to Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate), a product for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by designated susceptible Gram-positive organisms. As part of a reorganization and reprioritization of its internal sales force, the Company made the decision to cease promotion of Sivextro in the U.S. market by the end of 2019. This decision resulted in reduced cash flow projections for Sivextro , which indicated that the Sivextro intangible asset value was not fully recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market  participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to Sivextro that, when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above.\n\nIPR&amp;D that  the  Company  acquires  through  business  combinations  represents  the  fair  value  assigned  to  incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. Amounts capitalized as IPR&amp;D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until",

      "question": "How did MRK's sales of Prevymis evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the product's market positioning in the Hospital Acute Care segment?",
      "answer": "MRK's sales of Prevymis increased from $370 million in 2022 to $428 million in 2023, and then significantly rose to $785 million in 2024. This represents a compound growth rate of approximately 46% over the two-year period from 2022 to 2024. The substantial growth in sales suggests that Prevymis gained stronger market adoption and became more strategically positioned within the Hospital Acute Care segment, particularly as a prophylactic treatment for CMV infection in high-risk transplant recipients.",

        "Hop 1: MRK(2022) \u2192 Prevymis: MRK reported Prevymis sales of $370 million in 2022 (U.S. $153M + Int'l $218M), indicating early-stage market presence in the Hospital Acute Care segment.",
        "Hop 2: MRK(2024) \u2192 Prevymis: By 2024, Prevymis sales had grown to $785 million (U.S. $371M + Int'l $414M), more than doubling from 2022 levels, showing strong uptake and increasing importance in the product portfolio.",
        "Hop 3: MRK(2023) \u2192 Prevymis: In 2023, Prevymis sales were $428 million (U.S. $188M + Int'l $240M), showing initial growth from 2022 and setting the stage for the more dramatic increase in 2024."

      "question": "How did Merck's development and regulatory strategy for MK-8591A evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression indicate about the company's approach to HIV treatment innovation?",
      "answer": "Merck's development strategy for MK-8591A remained in Phase 3 entry as of 2022, with the drug listed under Phase 3 (entry date February 2020) in combination with doravirine and islatravir for HIV-1 infection. By 2023, MK-8591A was still in Phase 3 and continued to be referenced under the same development stage, indicating no significant advancement in its clinical trial timeline over that year. In 2024, Merck introduced a new combination therapy, MK-8591D (islatravir+lenacapavir), which was listed under Phase 3 entry (October 2024), suggesting a strategic pivot or expansion into long-acting HIV treatment regimens. This three-year progression indicates that Merck maintained a cautious, long-term approach to HIV treatment innovation, focusing on optimizing drug combinations and delivery mechanisms rather than rushing MK-8591A to market, while also diversifying its pipeline to include next-generation therapies like MK-8591D.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK(2022) \u2192 MK-8591A: MK-8591A (doravirine+islatravir) is listed in Phase 3 development with an entry date of February 2020, indicating ongoing clinical trials without regulatory approval.",
        "Hop 2: MRK(2023) \u2192 MK-8591A: MK-8591A remains in Phase 3 status with no indication of progression to regulatory review or approval, showing continuity in development strategy.",
        "Hop 3: MRK(2024) \u2192 MK-8591A: MK-8591A remains in Phase 3, but Merck introduces MK-8591D (islatravir+lenacapavir), a new combination therapy in Phase 3 (October 2024), signaling an expanded HIV treatment portfolio."

      "answer": "In 2022, MK-1308A was listed as a combination therapy of quavonlimab and pembrolizumab, targeting renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a Phase 3 entry date in April 2021. By 2023, MK-1308A remained in focus as part of Merck\u2019s immuno-oncology pillar, specifically being evaluated for the treatment of RCC and positioned as a coformulation of quavonlimab with pembrolizumab. In 2024, MK-1308A continued to be a key component of Merck\u2019s immuno-oncology strategy, explicitly described as the coformulation of quavonlimab with pembrolizumab for RCC, and was included among more than 20 new Phase 3 studies initiated that year. Throughout this period, MK-1308A consistently relied on pembrolizumab (Keytruda), highlighting a stable and deepening partnership with Keytruda as a foundational immunotherapy. The progression from listing in 2022 to being embedded in a broader Phase 3 expansion by 2024 indicates a strategic emphasis on immuno-oncology combinations and a sustained commitment to advancing MK-1308A in RCC.",

      "question": "How did Medtronic's use of Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan?",
      "answer": "Medtronic consistently referenced the Form of Non-Employee Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement under the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan across all three years, indicating a sustained reliance on this specific compensation mechanism for non-employee directors. In 2022, the agreement was listed as Exhibit *10.42, incorporated by reference from the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In both 2023 and 2024, the same agreement (Exhibit *10.42) was included, again referencing the same 2015 filing, suggesting no substantive revision to the agreement during this period. This consistency implies that Medtronic maintained the same structure for non-employee RSU awards under the 2013 plan without introducing new forms or amendments over the three-year span.",

      "answer": "From fiscal years 2022 through 2024, Medtronic consistently disclosed the availability of 40,000 Euro Deferred Shares with a par value of \u20ac1.00 per share, but none were issued or outstanding in any of the three years. Meanwhile, the company actively repurchased ordinary shares to return capital to shareholders\u2014buying 0 million in fiscal 2023 and 25 million in fiscal 2024 at average prices of $91.31 and $83.04, respectively. In March 2024, the Board authorized an incremental $5.0 billion for share repurchases, bringing total authorization to $11.0 billion, with $5.3 billion remaining as of April 26, 2024. This pattern reveals a strategic preference for using ordinary share repurchases rather than leveraging alternative share classes like Euro Deferred Shares to manage capital structure and deliver shareholder returns.",

Shareholders' E quity\n\nShare  Capital Medtronic plc is authorized to issue 2.6 billion Ordinary Shares, $0.0001  par  value; 40 thousand Euro Deferred Shares, \u20ac1.00  par  value; 127.5 million Preferred Shares, $0.20 par value; and 500 thousand A Preferred Shares, $1.00 par value.\n\nEuro Deferred Shares The authorized share capital of the Company includes 40 thousand Euro Deferred Shares, with a par value of \u20ac1.00 per share. At April 26, 2024, no Euro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding.\n\nPreferred  Shares The  authorized  share  capital  of  the  Company  includes 127.5  million  of  Preferred  Shares,  with  a  par  value  of  $0.20  per  share. At April  26,  2024, no Preferred Shares were issued or outstanding.\n\nA Preferred Shares The authorized share capital of the Company includes 500 thousand A Preferred Shares, with a par value of $1.00 per share. At April 26, 2024, no A Preferred Shares were outstanding.\n\nDividends The timing, declaration, and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's ordinary shares falls within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, the Company's earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of the Company's businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.\n\nOrdinary Share Repurchase Program Shares are repurchased on occasion to support the Company's stock-based compensation programs and to return capital to shareholders. During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 25 million and 6 million shares, respectively, at an average price of $83.04 and $91.31, respectively.\n\nIn March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $6.0 billion for repurchase of the Company's ordinary shares. In March 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an incremental $5.0 billion for share repurchases. There is no specific time-period associated with these repurchase authorizations. At April 26, 2024, the Company had used $5.7 billion of the $11.0 billion authorized under the repurchase program, leaving approximately $5.3 billion available for future repurchases. The Company accounts for repurchases of ordinary shares using the par value method and shares repurchased are cancelled.\n\n## 12. Stock Purchase and Award Plans\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, the Company granted stock awards under the 2021 Medtronic plc Long Term Incentive Plan (2021 Plan). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock and cash-based awards. At April 26, 2024, there were approximately 88 million shares available for future grants under the 2021 Plan.",

      "question": "How did the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for valuing non-qualified stock options at MDT evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression suggest about the company's approach to estimating volatility and employee exercise behavior over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDT used the Black-Scholes model for valuing non-qualified stock options, requiring assumptions about employee exercise behavior, risk-free interest rates, stock price volatility, and expected dividends. By 2023, the company began incorporating implied volatility based on market-traded options into its volatility assumptions, in addition to historical volatility. This method was retained in 2024, indicating a more sophisticated and market-informed approach to volatility estimation. The consistent use of the Black-Scholes model across all three years shows strategic continuity, while the addition of implied volatility in 2023 and 2024 suggests a shift toward aligning internal assumptions more closely with external market signals, reflecting increased confidence in market-based data for risk assessment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MDT](2022) \u2192 [Non-Qualified Options]: MDT discloses use of the Black-Scholes model for valuing non-qualified options, requiring assumptions about employee exercise behavior, risk-free interest rates, volatility, and expected dividends.",
        "Hop 2: [MDT](2023) \u2192 [Non-Qualified Options]: MDT adds implied volatility based on market-traded options to its volatility assumptions, signaling a more nuanced approach to option valuation.",
        "Hop 3: [MDT](2024) \u2192 [Non-Qualified Options]: MDT continues to use the enhanced Black-Scholes model with a blend of historical and implied volatility, showing sustained integration of market-based data into valuation assumptions."

      "question": "How did BMY's issuance and structuring of long-term debt, specifically the 4.350% Senior Notes due 2047, evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern indicate about the company's long-term financing strategy?",
      "answer": "BMY consistently referenced the 4.350% Senior Notes due 2047 across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014indicating that this instrument remained a core part of its long-term debt portfolio. In 2022, the notes were listed among a broader set of senior notes issued under the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated November 22, 2019. In 2023, the notes were again included in the list of outstanding debt instruments, this time alongside newer issuances like the $1.75 billion 2.950% Notes due 2032 and the $2 billion 3.700% Notes due 2052. By 2024, the 4.350% Senior Notes due 2047 remained part of the capital structure, even as BMY issued additional long-term debt such as the $3.75 billion 4.250% Senior Notes due 2049. This persistence of the 2047 notes, despite new issuances, suggests a strategy of maintaining diversified long-term liabilities with staggered maturities, where the 4.350% notes serve as a stable, high-yield component of the company's capital structure.",

        "Hop 2: [BMY](2023) \u2192 [4.350% Senior Notes due 2047]: Reappeared in the debt disclosures, now alongside newer long-term notes such as the $1.75 billion 2.950% Notes due 2032 and $2 billion 3.700% Notes due 2052, showing continued relevance amid new financings.",
        "Hop 3: [BMY](2024) \u2192 [4.350% Senior Notes due 2047]: Still present in the capital structure, even as BMY issued additional large-scale long-term debt like the $3.75 billion 4.250% Senior Notes due 2049, indicating strategic retention of this instrument."

      "question": "What does the evolution of Bristol-Myers Squibb's use of five-year vesting Restricted Stock Units across 2022-2024 suggest about the company's approach to executive compensation alignment and retention?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY referenced five-year vesting RSUs under the 2014 and 2017 Stock Incentive Plans, indicating a multi-plan structure. By 2023, the company continued offering five-year vesting RSUs but began referencing them under the 2021 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, suggesting a consolidation of equity compensation frameworks. In 2024, the five-year vesting RSUs were exclusively tied to the 2021 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, showing a full transition away from legacy plans. This progression indicates a more centralized and standardized executive compensation approach, likely aimed at improving retention and aligning incentives under a single, updated plan framework.",

      "question": "How did Merck's financial and strategic treatment of Dificid evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of asset valuation, therapeutic positioning, and global revenue contribution?",
      "answer": "Merck's treatment of Dificid evolved significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, Dificid was reported as a $145 million intangible asset under acquired human health marketed products, indicating its established but modest valuation on the balance sheet. By 2023, Dificid was explicitly highlighted in Merck's Pharmaceutical segment as a key product for treating C. difficile-associated diarrhea, signaling a clear therapeutic positioning in the hospital acute care space. In 2024, Dificid generated $340 million in global sales (with $303 million from the U.S. and $37 million internationally), demonstrating its role as a revenue contributor within the Hospital Acute Care franchise. This progression shows Dificid moving from a relatively minor asset to a strategically recognized product with measurable financial performance.",

        "Hop 1: MRK(2022) \u2192 Dificid: Dificid was listed as a $145 million intangible asset under human health marketed products, indicating its presence in Merck\u2019s portfolio but not explicitly describing its therapeutic or revenue role.",
        "Hop 2: MRK(2023) \u2192 Dificid: Dificid was named in the Pharmaceutical segment as a treatment for C. difficile-associated diarrhea, positioning it clearly within Merck\u2019s hospital acute care offerings and signaling its therapeutic importance.",
        "Hop 3: MRK(2024) \u2192 Dificid: Dificid generated $340 million in total sales globally, with specific U.S. and international revenue breakdowns, showing its financial contribution and continued presence in Merck\u2019s product lineup."

          "chunk_text": "\nAcquired intangibles include products and product rights, IPR&amp;D, trade names and patents, licenses and other, which are  initially  recorded  at  fair  value,  assigned  an  estimated  useful  life,  and  amortized  primarily  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  their estimated useful lives. Some of the more significant acquired intangibles, on a net basis, related to human health marketed products (included  in  products  and  product  rights  above)  at  December  31,  2021  include Reblozyl ,  $3.8  billion; Zerbaxa ,  $478  million; Gardasil/Gardasil 9, $191 million; Bridion , $145 million; Dificid , $145 million; Sivextro , $138 million; and Simponi , $101 million. Additionally, the Company had $5.0 billion of net acquired intangibles related to animal health marketed products at December 31, 2021,  of  which  $2.3  billion  relate  primarily  to  trade  names  obtained  through  the  2019  acquisition  of Antelliq  (see  Note  4). At December 31, 2021, IPR&amp;D primarily relates to MK-7962 (sotatercept), $6.4 billion, obtained through the acquisition of Acceleron in 2021 (see Note 4); MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $2.0 billion, obtained through the acquisition of ArQule in 2020 (see below and Note 4); and MK-7264 (gefapixant) $832 million, obtained through the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals in 2016. Some of the more significant net intangible assets included in licenses and other above at December 31, 2021 include Lynparza, $1.1 billion, related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca; Lenvima, $1.0 billion, related to a collaboration with Eisai; Adempas, $806 million related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer;  and  Verquvo,  $68  million,  also  related  to  a  collaboration  with  Bayer.  See  Note  5  for additional information related to the intangible assets associated with these collaborations.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  recorded  an  impairment  charge  of  $1.6  billion  within Cost  of  sales related  to Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for injection, a combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of certain bacterial infections. In December 2020, the Company temporarily suspended sales of Zerbaxa , and subsequently issued a product recall, following the identification of product sterility issues. The recall constituted a triggering event requiring the evaluation of the Zerbaxa intangible asset for impairment. The Company revised its cash flow forecasts for Zerbaxa utilizing certain assumptions around the return to market timeline and anticipated uptake in sales thereafter. These revised cash flow forecasts indicated that the Zerbaxa intangible  asset  value  was  not  fully  recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best  estimate  of  the  fair  value  of  the  intangible  asset  related  to Zerbaxa that,  when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above. The Company also wrote-off inventory of $120 million to Cost of sales in 2020 related to the Zerbaxa recall. A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nIn 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges related to marketed products and other intangibles of $705 million. Of this amount, $612 million related to Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate), a product for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by designated susceptible Gram-positive organisms. As part of a reorganization and reprioritization of its internal sales force, the Company made the decision to cease promotion of Sivextro in the U.S. market by the end of 2019. This decision resulted in reduced cash flow projections for Sivextro , which indicated that the Sivextro intangible asset value was not fully recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flows  basis.  The  Company  utilized  market  participant  assumptions  to  determine  its  best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to Sivextro that, when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above.\n\nIPR&amp;D that  the  Company  acquires  through  business  combinations  represents  the  fair  value  assigned  to  incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. Amounts capitalized as IPR&amp;D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until",

      "question": "How did Merck's development timeline and regulatory status for the HIV-1 treatment MK-8591A evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's long-term strategy in the HIV therapeutic area?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MK-8591A (doravirine+islatravir) was listed as being in Phase 3 development with a Phase 3 entry date of February 2020, indicating it was already in late-stage trials. By 2023, MK-8591A remained in Phase 3, with no indication of regulatory submission or approval, suggesting delays or ongoing evaluation. In 2024, MK-8591A remained under development, but notably, the FDA lifted a clinical hold on December 4, 2024, signaling resolution of prior regulatory concerns. However, the compound remained under a partial clinical hold for higher doses. This 3-year trajectory shows Merck's persistent commitment to the HIV-1 treatment space despite regulatory challenges, with MK-8591A remaining a key part of its infectious disease pipeline.",

        "Hop 2: MRK(2023) \u2192 MK-8591A: MK-8591A remained in Phase 3 with no indication of approval, suggesting continued development without regulatory breakthroughs.",

      "question": "How has Merck's development strategy for MK-1308A evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its clinical focus, combination therapies, and regulatory progress?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MK-1308A was listed as part of Merck's oncology pipeline, specifically for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and was in Phase 3 development in combination with pembrolizumab. By 2023, MK-1308A was explicitly described as a coformulation of quavonlimab (an anti-CTLA-4 antibody) with pembrolizumab, and it was being evaluated for the treatment of RCC, indicating a more defined therapeutic focus and formulation strategy. In 2024, MK-1308A remained a key immuno-oncology candidate within Merck's Phase 3 portfolio, continuing to be evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab for RCC, with no indication of regulatory approval yet but sustained strategic emphasis on its development. This progression shows a consistent focus on RCC with increasing specificity in formulation and therapeutic strategy over time.",

      "question": "How did Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) referencing and positioning of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the plan's ongoing strategic importance to executive and director compensation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BMY referenced the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan as part of a broader list of historical compensation and incentive plans (Exhibit 10qq), indicating its inclusion in the company's legacy governance framework. In 2023, the plan was again listed (Exhibit 10vv), but now alongside more recently amended plans like the 2021 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, suggesting it remained a relevant component of the company\u2019s incentive compensation structure. By 2024, the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan was still explicitly listed (Exhibit 10pp), but now positioned just before the 2021 plan, indicating a continued but potentially transitional role as newer plans took precedence. This 3-year progression shows that while the 2014 plan remained a foundational reference point, its relative prominence declined as BMY shifted toward more recent incentive frameworks, reflecting an evolving executive compensation strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [BMY](2022) \u2192 [2014 Equity Incentive Plan]: Listed among legacy plans (Exhibit 10qq), indicating inclusion in historical governance framework.",
        "Hop 2: [BMY](2023) \u2192 [2014 Equity Incentive Plan]: Still referenced (Exhibit 10vv), now adjacent to the 2021 plan, showing coexistence with newer structures.",
        "Hop 3: [BMY](2024) \u2192 [2014 Equity Incentive Plan]: Maintained in filings (Exhibit 10pp), but placed immediately before the 2021 plan, suggesting a foundational but less dominant role."

      "question": "How did BMY's issuance and positioning of the $750,000,000 2.350% Notes due 2040 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "The $750,000,000 2.350% Notes due 2040 were consistently referenced across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014as part of BMY\u2019s broader debt structure, indicating ongoing acknowledgment and maintenance of this liability. In 2022, the notes were listed among other debt instruments issued in 2020. In 2023, the notes were reiterated alongside newer issuances like the $1,000,000,000 5.750% Notes due 2031 and $1,250,000,000 6.250% Notes due 2053, suggesting a diversification of BMY\u2019s debt maturity profile. By 2024, the notes remained embedded within the company\u2019s long-term debt disclosures, appearing alongside high-yield senior notes such as the 5.700% Senior Notes due 2040. This consistent inclusion, without any refinancing or redemption actions noted, implies a stable long-term debt strategy where BMY maintains its 2040 notes as a core component of its capital structure.",

      "question": "How has Bristol-Myers Squibb's long-term debt structure evolved from 2022 through 2024, with respect to the positioning of its 4.350% Senior Notes due 2047 among other debt instruments?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Bristol-Myers Squibb consistently included the 4.350% Senior Notes due 2047 in its list of debt instruments, indicating its ongoing importance in the company's long-term capital structure. In 2022, the notes were listed alongside other long-dated instruments like the 5.000% Senior Notes due 2045 and the 4.550% Senior Notes due 2048, suggesting a diversified long-term debt profile. In 2023, the notes remained positioned among similarly long-dated obligations, including the newly issued $1.25 billion 6.250% Notes due 2053 and $1.25 billion 6.400% Notes due 2063, which indicates a strategy of layering in higher-yielding, long-duration debt. By 2024, the notes were again disclosed among a mix of both older and newer debt tranches, including $3.75 billion 4.250% Senior Notes due 2049 and $2 billion 4.125% Senior Notes due 2039, showing a continued emphasis on long-term financing. This consistency in disclosure reflects a strategic commitment to maintaining the 4.350% Senior Notes due 2047 as a foundational part of BMY\u2019s long-term debt structure.",

      "question": "How has DHR's exposure to compliance costs and reporting obligations under the Open Payments Act evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of financial impact and regulatory scope expansion?",
      "answer": "In 2022, DHR referenced the Open Payments Act in the context of broader healthcare regulations, noting that compliance with evolving regulatory regimes was a routine part of operations but did not isolate specific costs tied to this requirement. In 2023, while the company again mentioned the Act as part of its regulatory obligations, there was still no direct financial disclosure specific to Open Payments reporting. By 2024, the company highlighted the growing complexity of compliance, noting that similar transparency laws were being adopted internationally, signaling an expansion in the scope of reporting obligations. However, DHR did not disclose specific costs related to the Open Payments Act in any of the three years, indicating that these obligations remained embedded within broader compliance expenditures. The trend suggests increasing global regulatory alignment with Open Payments-like transparency frameworks, which may imply rising indirect compliance costs and operational complexity over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DHR(2022) \u2192 Open Payments Act: Regulatory disclosure includes the Act as part of a list of healthcare laws without specific cost allocation.",

        "Hop 3: DHR(2024) \u2192 Open Payments Act: The company notes that similar reporting laws are increasingly adopted globally, suggesting growing regulatory scope and potential future cost implications."

          "chunk_text": "- The federal Civ il Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or serv ices.\n- The Open Payments Act requires manufacturers of medical dev ices cov ered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (subject to certain exceptions) to record payments and other transfers of v alue to a broad range of healthcare prov iders and teaching hospitals and to report this data as well as ownership and inv estment interests held by the physicians described abov e and their immediate family members to HHS for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements hav e also been enacted on the state lev el, and an increasing number of countries either hav e adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.\n\nIn addition, some of the in v itro diagnostic drugs-of-abuse assays and reagents sold by the Company's subsidiaries contain small amounts of controlled substances, and as a result some of the Company's facilities are inspected periodically by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to assess whether the Company properly handles, stores and disposes of controlled substances in the manufacture of those products.\n\nFederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activ ities and activ ities that potentially harm consumers. Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims inv olv ing healthcare items or serv ices reimbursed by any third-party payor, including priv ate insurers. Further, there are state laws that require medical dev ice manufacturers to comply with the v oluntary compliance guidelines and the relev ant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal gov ernment, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare prov iders and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of v alue prov ided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representativ es; and state laws gov erning the priv acy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\n\nFor a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Healthcare Reform\n\nIn the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, there hav e been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislativ e and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in the United States, in March 2010, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act) (collectiv ely, the 'PPACA') was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both gov ernmental and priv ate insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry. Since its enactment, there hav e been judicial, Congressional and executiv e challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future.\n\nMoreover, there has recently been heightened gov ernmental scrutiny ov er the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in sev eral Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, rev iew the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform gov ernment program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Indiv idual states in the U.S. hav e also become increasingly activ e in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Other countries, including China, hav e also introduced similar measures with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improv ing quality and/or expanding access.\n\n## Data Privacy and Security Law s\n\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data priv acy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of hav ing access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitiv e data in the course of our business. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') imposes significant restrictions on how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to superv isory authorities with significant fines for non-compliance. In the U.S., HIPAA priv acy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the av ailability and confidentiality of patient health information, indiv idual states regulate data breach and security requirements, and multiple gov ernmental bodies assert authority ov er aspects of the protection of personal priv acy. State priv acy laws in California impose some of the same features as the GDPR and hav e prompted an",

Many states, foreign countries and supranational bodies have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the U.S. federal regulations discussed above and below, including the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws.\n\n- Many of our healthcare-related products are purchased by healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, many of our healthcare-related products are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ('HHS'), including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ('CMS'), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. Third-party payers are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services and, in international markets, many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. Price ceilings, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a thirdparty payor not to cover a product could reduce usage and patient demand for the product.\n- The U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback or bribe), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\n- The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ('HIPAA') prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information. Similar to the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\n- The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Federal AntiKickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.\n- The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services.\n- The Open Payments Act requires manufacturers of medical devices covered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program with specific exceptions to record payments and other transfers of value to a broad range of healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and to report this data as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members to HHS for subsequent public disclosure.

These products integrate and automate the complicated and time-intensiv e steps associated with DNA-based testing (including sample preparation and DNA amplification and detection) to allow the testing to be performed in both laboratory and non-laboratory env ironments with minimal training and infrastructure. These products also include systems which commonly test for healthcare-associated infections, respiratory disease, sexual health and v irology.\n\nAcute Care Diagnostics -The acute care diagnostics business is a leading worldwide prov ider of instruments, software and related consumables and serv ices that are used in both laboratory and point-of-care env ironments to rapidly measure critical parameters, including blood gases, electrolytes, metabolites and cardiac markers, as well as for anemia and high-sensitiv ity glucose testing. Typical users of these products include hospital central laboratories, intensiv e care units, hospital operating rooms, hospital emergency rooms, physicians' office laboratories and blood banks.\n\nPathology Diagnostics -The pathology diagnostics business is a leader in the anatomical pathology industry, offering a comprehensiv e suite of instrumentation and related consumables used across the entire workflow of a pathology laboratory. The anatomical pathology diagnostics products include chemical and immuno-staining instruments, reagents, antibodies and consumables; tissue embedding, processing and slicing (microtomes) instruments and related reagents and consumables; slide cov er-slipping and slide/cassette marking instruments; imaging instrumentation including slide scanners, microscopes and cameras; software solutions to store, share and analyze pathology images digitally; and minimally inv asiv e, v acuumassisted breast biopsy and lesion excision instruments and breast surgery localization solutions. Typical users of these products include pathologists, lab managers and researchers.\n\nCustomers served by the Diagnostics segment select products based on a number of factors, including product quality and reliability, the scope of tests that can be performed, the accuracy and speed of the product, the product's ability to enhance productiv ity, ease of use, total cost of ownership and access to a highly qualified serv ice and support network as well as the other factors described under the heading 'Competition' below. The businesses in Danaher's Diagnostics segment market their products and serv ices under key brands including BECKMAN COULTER, CEPHEID, HEMOCUE, LEICA BIOSYSTEMS, MAMMOTOME and RADIOMETER. Manufacturing facilities are located in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The business sells to customers primarily through direct sales personnel and, to a lesser extent, through independent distributors.\n\n************************************\n\nThe following discussion includes information common to all of Danaher's segments.\n\n## Materials\n\nThe Company's manufacturing operations employ a wide v ariety of raw materials, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemistries, original equipment manufacturers ('OEM') products, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Prices of oil and gas also affect the Company's costs for freight and utilities and hav e an indirect impact on the cost of other purchased materials. The Company purchases raw materials from a large number of sources around the world. No single supplier is material to the Company. For some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications only a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers can readily prov ide such components. The Company utilizes a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to its supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternativ e materials and qualification of multiple supply sources.\n\nDuring 2024, there were no material effects on the business related to the av ailability of raw materials. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for the Company's operations, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe Company owns numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate the Company's intellectual property is important to its operations, the Company does not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license (or any related group of any such items) to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time the Company engages in litigation to protect its intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to the Company's intellectual property, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.' All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, Danaher.",

      "question": "How has Bristol-Myers Squibb's treatment of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan evolved across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this continuity suggest about its role in the company's executive compensation framework alongside newer plans like the 2021 Stock Award and Incentive Plan?",
      "answer": "The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan was consistently referenced in all three years \u2014 2022, 2023, and 2024 \u2014 via the same Exhibit 99.2 to the registration statement on Form S-8 filed on November 25, 2019. Despite the introduction of the 2021 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (incorporated by reference to Exhibit B of the 2021 proxy statement), the repeated inclusion of the 2014 plan across filings indicates it remains an active and integral component of Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s executive compensation strategy. This continuity suggests that the 2014 plan continues to serve a complementary role alongside newer equity incentive mechanisms, potentially for specific executive cohorts or legacy award structures.",

        "Hop 2: BMY(2024) \u2192 2014 Equity Incentive Plan: The same Exhibit 99.2 is referenced, showing no change in how the plan is incorporated, despite newer plans being in place.",
        "Hop 3: BMY(2022) \u2192 2014 Equity Incentive Plan: The plan is again referenced via the same Exhibit 99.2, establishing a consistent pattern of inclusion across all three years."

      "question": "How has the persistence of Bristol-Myers Squibb's $750,000,000 2.350% Notes due 2040 in its capital structure filings from 2022 through 2024 reflected its strategy in managing long-term fixed-rate debt obligations?",
      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb has consistently included the $750,000,000 2.350% Notes due 2040 in its capital structure filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating a stable long-term debt strategy focused on maintaining fixed interest rate obligations. In 2022, the notes were explicitly listed as part of the company's long-term debt instruments, signaling their importance in the capital structure. In 2023, the notes were again referenced, reaffirming the company's commitment to this fixed-rate liability. By 2024, the continued inclusion of the notes shows that BMY has not refinanced or retired this instrument despite market fluctuations, suggesting a strategic decision to retain predictable long-term liabilities. This consistency in retaining the 2040 notes across filings reflects a deliberate approach to long-term interest rate risk management, favoring fixed-rate debt to stabilize future interest expenses.",

      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb's interest rate commitment for its 4.350% Senior Notes due 2047 has remained consistent across the 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings. In 2022, the notes were referenced in Exhibit 4bbb of the 10-K filing, issued under the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture dated November 13, 2020. In 2023, the same 4.350% rate was reiterated in Exhibit 4ff, reaffirmed under the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture dated November 13, 2023. In 2024, the rate was again explicitly stated as 4.350% in Exhibit 4ff, incorporated by reference to the same original Form 8-K filing from November 22, 2019. This consistent disclosure across three years indicates a deliberate and stable long-term debt strategy, where the company maintains transparency and predictability in its long-term financing obligations despite changing market conditions.",

      "question": "What does Bristol-Myers Squibb's use of five-year vesting Restricted Stock Units across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 equity incentive plans reveal about its long-term executive retention strategy?",
      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb consistently utilized five-year vesting Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) across its equity incentive plans in 2022, 2023, and 2024, demonstrating a strategic emphasis on long-term executive retention and alignment with shareholder interests. In 2022, the company referenced five-year vesting RSUs under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (BMY_10k_2022.pdf), showing early adoption of extended vesting terms. In 2023, the company continued this structure under the 2021 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (BMY_10k_2023.pdf), reinforcing its commitment to multi-year equity compensation. By 2024, the five-year vesting RSU remained a core component under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (BMY_10k_2024.pdf), indicating a stable, long-term oriented executive compensation framework. This consistent use of five-year vesting RSUs over three years suggests a deliberate effort to retain key leadership through extended equity commitments.",
