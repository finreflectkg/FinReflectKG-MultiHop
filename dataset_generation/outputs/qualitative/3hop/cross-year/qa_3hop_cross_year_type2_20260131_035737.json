      "answer": "The penetration rate of the Target Debit Card and associated RedCard products declined from 20.5% in 2022 to 19.8% in 2023 and further to 17.8% in 2024. This consistent decline over three years suggests a weakening in the effectiveness of Target's loyalty-driven payment strategy, potentially signaling reduced customer engagement with the RedCard program or increased competition in retail payment offerings.",

The collectiv e interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitiv e, and consumer behav ioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.\n\nTD Bank Group offers credit to qualified guests through T arget-branded credit cards: the T arget Credit Card and the T arget MasterCard Credit Card (T arget Credit  Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary  T arget  Debit  Card and  T arget  Circle  Card  Reloadable Account.  Collectiv ely, we refer to these products as T arget Circle Cards. Guests receiv e a 5 percent discount on v irtually all purchases when they use a T arget Circle Card at T arget. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using T arget Circle Cards (T arget Circle Card Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful  portion  of  incremental  purchases  on  our  T arget  Circle  Cards  are  also  incremental  sales  for  T arget.  For  the  years  ended  February  1,  2025, February 3, 2024, and  January 28, 2023, total  T arget  Circle  Card  Penetration  was  17.8  percent,  18.6  percent,  and  19.8  percent,  respectiv ely.  See  the Customer Loyalty Programs section within Item 1. Business on page 5 for information about the rebranding of RedCards.\n\n## Gross Margin (GM) Rate\n\nOur gross margin rate was 28.2 percent in 2024 and 27.5 percent in 2023. The increase reflected the net impact of\n\n- merchandising activ ities, including cost improv ements which more than offset higher promotional and clearance markdown rates, as well as growth in adv ertising and marketplace rev enues;\n- lower book to physical inv entory adjustments in 2024; and\n- higher supply chain &amp; digital fulfillment costs due to new supply chain facilities coming online and an increase in digital v olume.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative (SG&amp;A) Expense Rate\n\nOur SG&amp;A expense rate was 20.6 percent in 2024, compared with 20.0 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of cost increases across our business, including higher team member pay and benefits and higher general liability expenses, partially offset by the benefit of lower store remodel-related expenses.\n\nTA RGET CORPORA TION\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n28",

      "question": "How did the penetration rate of the Target MasterCard Credit Card evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about consumer adoption and engagement with Target's financial products?",
      "answer": "The penetration rate of the Target MasterCard Credit Card, as part of the broader RedCard/Circle Card offerings, declined from 20.5% in 2022 to 19.8% in 2023, and further to 17.8% in 2024. This consistent decline over three years suggests a weakening in consumer adoption or engagement with Target's proprietary credit offerings, despite the continued incentive of a 5% discount. The drop in penetration indicates that while RedCard sales increased in dollar terms, total sales grew even faster, diluting the proportional use of the cards. This trend could signal shifting consumer preferences, increased competition in retail credit, or reduced sensitivity to the discount incentive.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [TGT](2022) \u2192 [Target MasterCard Credit Card]: RedCard Penetration was 20.5% in 2022, with the note that penetration declined as total sales grew faster than RedCard sales.",
        "Hop 2: [TGT](2023) \u2192 [Target MasterCard Credit Card]: RedCard Penetration dropped to 19.8%, continuing the trend of slower card adoption relative to overall sales growth.",
        "Hop 3: [TGT](2024) \u2192 [Target MasterCard Credit Card]: Rebranded as Target Circle Card, penetration further declined to 17.8%, indicating a sustained downward trend in proportional usage despite continued 5% discount incentive."

The collectiv e interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitiv e, and consumer behav ioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.\n\nTD Bank Group offers credit to qualified guests through T arget-branded credit cards: the T arget Credit Card and the T arget MasterCard Credit Card (T arget Credit  Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary  T arget  Debit  Card and  T arget  Circle  Card  Reloadable Account.  Collectiv ely, we refer to these products as T arget Circle Cards. Guests receiv e a 5 percent discount on v irtually all purchases when they use a T arget Circle Card at T arget. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using T arget Circle Cards (T arget Circle Card Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful  portion  of  incremental  purchases  on  our  T arget  Circle  Cards  are  also  incremental  sales  for  T arget.  For  the  years  ended  February  1,  2025, February 3, 2024, and  January 28, 2023, total  T arget  Circle  Card  Penetration  was  17.8  percent,  18.6  percent,  and  19.8  percent,  respectiv ely.

The increase reflected the net impact of\n\n- merchandising activ ities, including cost improv ements which more than offset higher promotional and clearance markdown rates, as well as growth in adv ertising and marketplace rev enues;\n- lower book to physical inv entory adjustments in 2024; and\n- higher supply chain &amp; digital fulfillment costs due to new supply chain facilities coming online and an increase in digital v olume.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative (SG&amp;A) Expense Rate\n\nOur SG&amp;A expense rate was 20.6 percent in 2024, compared with 20.0 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of cost increases across our business, including higher team member pay and benefits and higher general liability expenses, partially offset by the benefit of lower store remodel-related expenses.\n\nTA RGET CORPORA TION\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n28",

      "answer": "Across the three years, merchandise discounts remained a consistent component of Target's employee compensation package, but the framing and emphasis evolved alongside broader benefits enhancements. In 2022, merchandise discounts were listed among core benefits, alongside a minimum wage of $15/hour. By 2023, the wage range had expanded to $15\u2013$24/hour, and merchandise discounts were included in a more detailed benefits package that now emphasized financial wellness components like 401(k) matching and tuition reimbursement. In 2024, merchandise discounts remained part of the compensation structure, but were presented within an expanded benefits ecosystem that included mental health services and virtual healthcare\u2014suggesting a strategic shift toward holistic employee well-being while maintaining traditional perks.

The collectiv e interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitiv e, and consumer behav ioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.\n\nTD Bank Group offers credit to qualified guests through T arget-branded credit cards: the T arget Credit Card and the T arget MasterCard Credit Card (T arget Credit  Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary  T arget  Debit  Card and  T arget  Circle  Card  Reloadable Account.  Collectiv ely, we refer to these products as T arget Circle Cards. Guests receiv e a 5 percent discount on v irtually all purchases when they use a T arget Circle Card at T arget. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using T arget Circle Cards (T arget Circle Card Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful  portion  of  incremental  purchases  on  our  T arget  Circle  Cards  are  also  incremental  sales  for  T arget.  For  the  years  ended  February  1,  2025, February 3, 2024, and  January 28, 2023, total  T arget  Circle  Card  Penetration  was  17.8  percent,  18.6  percent,  and  19.8  percent,  respectiv ely.  See  the Customer Loyalty Programs section within Item 1. Business on page 5 for information about the rebranding of RedCards.\n\n## Gross Margin (GM) Rate\n\nOur gross margin rate was 28.2 percent in 2024 and 27.5 percent in 2023. The increase reflected the net impact of\n\n- merchandising activ ities, including cost improv ements which more than offset higher promotional and clearance markdown rates, as well as growth in adv ertising and marketplace rev enues;\n- lower book to physical inv entory adjustments in 2024; and\n- higher supply chain &amp; digital fulfillment costs due to new supply chain facilities coming online and an increase in digital v olume.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative (SG&amp;A) Expense Rate\n\nOur SG&amp;A expense rate was 20.6 percent in 2024, compared with 20.0 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of cost increases across our business, including higher team member pay and benefits and higher general liability expenses, partially offset by the benefit of lower store remodel-related expenses.\n\nTA RGET CORPORA TION\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n28",

      "answer": "Across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014Colgate-Palmolive consistently listed Palmolive among its 'principal global and regional trademarks' within the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment. This unbroken inclusion, despite evolving market dynamics and the company\u2019s expanding brand portfolio, signals a sustained emphasis on Palmolive as a strategically prioritized brand. Although specific sales contributions are not disclosed, the repeated prominence of Palmolive in the list of key trademarks over three consecutive years suggests it remains a core asset in the company\u2019s global branding strategy, particularly in categories like liquid hand soaps and household care products. This pattern implies that Palmolive continues to hold a foundational role in the company\u2019s consumer staples positioning, especially in markets where it has strong brand equity.",

      "answer": "Across 2022, 2023, and 2024, Colgate-Palmolive Co. remained consistently included in the PMI Peer Group, which was established based on four characteristics: global presence, focus on consumer products, net revenues, and market capitalization similar to PMI. This classification was unchanged year-over-year, indicating a stable peer benchmarking framework. The repeated inclusion of Colgate-Palmolive Co. in the peer group across all three years suggests that PMI maintained a consistent strategic lens for evaluating its competitive positioning within the broader consumer products sector, even as it excluded direct tobacco industry peers from the comparison.",

By 2023, the 3.875% Notes due 2042 remained, but newer notes such as the 4.125% and 4.875% Notes due 2043 and the 4.250% Notes due 2044 were still present, suggesting continued reliance on long-term debt issuance. However, in 2024, while the 3.875% Notes due 2042 were still listed, newer notes like the 4.125% Notes due 2043 and 4.250% Notes due 2044 were no longer included, indicating a potential consolidation or shift in long-term debt strategy.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PM's exposure to product regulation risk increased as regulatory constraints increasingly limited its ability to differentiate products and communicate with adult consumers. In 2022, the company highlighted risks around government investigations and intellectual property disputes, particularly affecting its RRPs. By 2023, it emphasized how product regulation was beginning to disproportionately impact the commercialization of RRPs compared to competitors. In 2024, the risk intensified, with regulation not only restricting product differentiation but also directly impacting the commercialization of its newer Smoke-Free Products (SFPs). This 3-year trajectory reveals a growing regulatory burden that constrained PM\u2019s strategic flexibility and marketing capabilities in key growth areas.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PM](2022) \u2192 [Product Regulation]: Regulatory risk centered on investigations and intellectual property issues, with early signs of constraints on RRP commercialization.",

        "Hop 3: [PM](2024) \u2192 [Product Regulation]: Regulation now directly constrained SFP commercialization and disproportionately impacted PM relative to competitors, signaling a more hostile regulatory environment."

We  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected  by  an  unfavorable  outcome  of  pending  or  future  investigations.

Contingencies-Other  Litigation and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Operating  Results  by  Business  SegmentBusiness Environment-Governmental Investigations' for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject.\n\n## We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and disputes relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business.\n\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable assets, and their protection is important to our business. If the steps we take to protect our intellectual  property  rights  globally,  including  through  a  combination  of  trademark,  design,  patent,  trade  secrets  and  other  intellectual property rights, are inadequate, or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights, notwithstanding legal protection, our business  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Moreover,  failing  to  manage  our  existing  and/or  future  intellectual  property  may  place  us  at  a competitive  disadvantage.  Intellectual  property  rights  of  third  parties  may  limit  our  ability  to  commercialize  our  products  or  improve product quality in one or more markets. Competitors or other third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could divert management's attention, be costly, disruptive, time-consuming and unpredictable and expose us to significant litigation costs and damages, and impede our ability to manufacture, commercialize and improve our products, and thus have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our profitability. In addition, if, as a result, we are unable to manufacture or sell our RRPs or improve their quality in one or more markets, our ability to convert adult smokers to our RRPs in such markets would be adversely affected.  See  Item  8,  Note  17. Contingencies-Other Litigation to  our  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for  a  description  of certain intellectual property proceedings.\n\n## Risks Related to our Competitive Environment\n\n## We face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs. Competitors  in  our  industry  include  three  large  international  tobacco  companies,  new  market  entrants,  particularly  with  respect  to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Some competitors have different profit, volume and regulatory objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. Certain new market entrants in the noncombustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific  substantiation  based  on  appropriate  R&amp;D  protocols  and  standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our RRPs, all of which could have a mutual adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions, accessibility to our products and availability of accurate information related to our products.",

Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

      "answer": "Imperial Brands PLC remained consistently included in Philip Morris International's (PMI) peer group across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024.

The repeated inclusion of Imperial Brands PLC over this period, alongside other major global consumer product companies such as British American Tobacco, Johnson & Johnson, and Nestl\u00e9, indicates that PMI viewed Imperial Brands as a key benchmark for performance and strategic positioning throughout this time.

      "answer": "In 2022, PMI identified Jackpot as one of its key local cigarette brands in the Philippines, alongside Fortune, indicating its importance in the regional market. In 2023, PMI reiterated its commitment to Jackpot as part of its local brand portfolio in the Philippines, maintaining its strategic focus amid broader global restructuring and integration of Swedish Match. By 2024, PMI continued to highlight Jackpot as a core local brand in the Philippines, even as it expanded its smoke-free product footprint to 95 markets and emphasized its IQOS and ZYN brands. This consistent mention of Jackpot across three years shows that, despite PMI\u2019s long-term vision of a smoke-free future, traditional cigarette brands like Jackpot remain strategically relevant in key regional markets like the Philippines.",

We  are  a  leading  international  tobacco  company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long-term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector.  Our  current  product  portfolio  primarily  consists  of  cigarettes  and  reduced-risk  products,  including  heat-not-burn,  vapor  and  oral nicotine  products,  which  are  sold  in  markets  outside  the  United  States.  Since  2008,  we  have  invested  more  than  $9  billion  to  develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas  of  pre-clinical  systems  toxicology,  clinical  and  behavioral  research,  as  well  as  post-market  studies.  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of a version of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. We describe  the  MRTP  order  in  more  detail  in  the  \"Business  Environment\"  section  of  Item  7. Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life-sciences, in February 2021, we announced our ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet patient and consumer needs.\n\nIn March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  to  smoke. We  have  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development,  scientific  assessment  and  commercialization.  Our  RRPs  are  smoke-free  products  that  contain  and/or  generate  far  lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.  Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our HEETS , HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO ( defined collectively as \" HEETS\") , Marlboro  Dimensions , Marlboro HeatSticks,  Parliament  HeatSticks and TEREA, as  well  as  the  KT&amp;G-licensed  brands, Fiit and Miix (outside of South Korea). Platform 1 was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014. As of December 31, 2021, our smoke-free products are available for sale in 71 markets in key cities or nationwide.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro , the world's best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 38% of our total 2021 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Bond Street, Chesterfield, L&amp;M , Lark and Philip Morris. These seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 79% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2021. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A in Indonesia, and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\nDuring  2021,  we  laid  the  foundation  for  our  long-term  growth  ambitions  beyond  nicotine  in  wellness  and  healthcare,  including  the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S, which provide essential capabilities for future product development.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized.

Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023. Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 3.7% in 2024.\n\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China.

      "question": "How did the maturity structure of Costco's 2.750% Senior Notes evolve across filings from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's debt management strategy over time?",
      "answer": "The maturity structure of Costco's 2.750% Senior Notes remained consistent across the 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, with all references indicating a fixed maturity date of May 18, 2024. Despite the multi-year span of disclosures, the notes were not refinanced or extended during this period, suggesting that Costco maintained a static approach to this specific debt instrument. This consistency implies a deliberate capital structure decision to allow the notes to mature without modification, aligning with a broader strategy of predictable debt repayment.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Costco disclosed that free-rent periods and step-rent provisions were recognized on a straight-line basis over the original lease term and any extension options that were reasonably certain to be exercised, using the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments. By fiscal year 2023, the company maintained the same accounting policy but emphasized that leases with periodic rent increases based on price indices or sales volume were recognized as variable lease payments. In fiscal year 2024, Costco reiterated its consistent application of these policies while reaffirming that leases did not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants, indicating a stable and consistent approach to lease accounting across the three-year period.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nSome leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nThe Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit  in  the  Company's  leases  is  not  easily  determinable,  the  present  value  of  the  sum  of  the  lease  payments  is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, net above.\n\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception  of  the  lease  term,  based  upon  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  costs  to  remove  the  improvements.  These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same  depreciation method  as  the leasehold improvement  assets  and  are  included with buildings  and improvements.  Estimated  ARO  liabilities  associated  with  these  leases  are  included  in  other  liabilities  in  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization.  The  Company  reviews  goodwill  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  for  impairment  or  when  circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair  value  based  on  expected  discounted  future  cash  flows,  while  the  market  approach  uses  comparable  public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\n\nGoodwill  is  included  in  other  long-term  assets  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  following  table  summarizes goodwill by reportable segment:\n\n",

For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying v alue of the asset group is considered recov erable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and ev entual disposition of the asset group exceed the respectiv e carrying v alue. In the ev ent that the carrying  v alue  is  not  considered  recov erable,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  the  asset  group  to  be  held  and  used  equal  to  the  excess  of  the carrying  v alue  abov e  the  estimated  fair  v alue  of  the  asset  group.  For  asset  groups  classified  as  held-for-sale  (disposal  group),  the  carrying  v alue  is compared to the disposal group's fair v alue less costs to sell. T he Company estimates fair v alue by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other v aluation techniques. Impairment charges recognized in 2024 and 2023 were immaterial. In 2022, the Company recognized a write-off of $118 for information technology assets, which is reflected in SG&amp;A.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company leases land, buildings, and/or equipment at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market v alue or purchase price stated in the agreement; (c) a right of first refusal in the ev ent of a third-party offer; or (d) a right of first offer if the landlord intends to sell.\n\nSome leases include free-rent periods and step-rent prov isions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property.

      "answer": "Costco maintained a consistent principal amount of $1,250 million for the 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 across all three years (2022\u20132024). However, the classification of the current portion of long-term debt changed significantly over time: in 2022, the current portion was $73 million, by 2023 it spiked to $1,081 million, and in 2024 it dropped to $103 million.

In 2023, the company reiterated this positioning, underscoring Kirkland Signature's role in lowering costs and enhancing merchandise offerings.

      "question": "How did the penetration rate of the Target Debit Card evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about its role in driving incremental sales for Target over time?",
      "answer": "The penetration rate of the Target Debit Card (as part of RedCards/Target Circle Cards) declined from 20.5% in 2022 to 18.6% in 2023, and further to 17.8% in 2024. This consistent decline over three years suggests a diminishing role of the card in driving incremental sales, despite its continued value proposition of a 5% discount. The drop indicates a potential weakening in customer engagement with the payment loyalty program, which Target had internally linked to increased sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [TGT](2022) \u2192 [Target Debit Card]: In 2022, the RedCard Penetration was 20.5%, indicating a strong adoption rate and internal belief that it drove incremental sales.",
        "Hop 2: [TGT](2023) \u2192 [Target Debit Card]: In 2023, RedCard Penetration dropped to 18.6%, showing early signs of a downward trend despite continued marketing and integration into the RedCard\u2122 branding.",
        "Hop 3: [TGT](2024) \u2192 [Target Debit Card]: By 2024, Target Circle Card Penetration (successor to RedCard) had further declined to 17.8%, suggesting a sustained reduction in the card\u2019s influence on customer purchasing behavior."

The collectiv e interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitiv e, and consumer behav ioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.\n\nTD Bank Group offers credit to qualified guests through T arget-branded credit cards: the T arget Credit Card and the T arget MasterCard Credit Card (T arget Credit  Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary  T arget  Debit  Card and  T arget  Circle  Card  Reloadable Account.  Collectiv ely, we refer to these products as T arget Circle Cards. Guests receiv e a 5 percent discount on v irtually all purchases when they use a T arget Circle Card at T arget. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using T arget Circle Cards (T arget Circle Card Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful  portion  of  incremental  purchases  on  our  T arget  Circle  Cards  are  also  incremental  sales  for  T arget.  For  the  years  ended  February  1,  2025, February 3, 2024, and  January 28, 2023, total  T arget  Circle  Card  Penetration  was  17.8  percent,  18.6  percent,  and  19.8  percent,  respectiv ely.  See  the Customer Loyalty Programs section within Item 1. Business on page 5 for information about the rebranding of RedCards.\n\n## Gross Margin (GM) Rate\n\nOur gross margin rate was 28.2 percent in 2024 and 27.5 percent in 2023. The increase reflected the net impact of\n\n- merchandising activ ities, including cost improv ements which more than offset higher promotional and clearance markdown rates, as well as growth in adv ertising and marketplace rev enues;\n- lower book to physical inv entory adjustments in 2024; and\n- higher supply chain &amp; digital fulfillment costs due to new supply chain facilities coming online and an increase in digital v olume.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative (SG&amp;A) Expense Rate\n\nOur SG&amp;A expense rate was 20.6 percent in 2024, compared with 20.0 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of cost increases across our business, including higher team member pay and benefits and higher general liability expenses, partially offset by the benefit of lower store remodel-related expenses.\n\nTA RGET CORPORA TION\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n28",

This downward trend suggests a gradual decrease in consumer engagement with Target's proprietary financial products relative to total sales, despite continued incentives like the 5% discount.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Target consistently offered merchandise and other discounts as part of its employee compensation and benefits package, but the context and broader financial well-being strategy surrounding these discounts evolved. In 2022, merchandise discounts were listed among a suite of benefits including healthcare, 401(k) plans, and tuition reimbursement, with a starting wage of at least $15 per hour. By 2023, the starting wage range had expanded to $15\u2013$24 per hour, and merchandise discounts were mentioned alongside new additions like sick pay and tuition-free education assistance, signaling a more comprehensive approach to employee financial support. In 2024, merchandise discounts remained a consistent offering, but were now framed within a broader narrative of equitable pay and belonging, with continued emphasis on financial wellness through benefits like free virtual healthcare and expanded mental health services. This 3-year trend indicates that while merchandise discounts remained a stable benefit, Target increasingly positioned them as part of a holistic financial and well-being strategy aimed at attracting and retaining talent.",

We are among the largest private employers in the United States (U.S.), and our workforce has varying goals and expectations of their employment relationship, from team members looking to build a career to students, retirees and others who are seeking to supplement their income in an enjoyable atmosphere. We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and  retain  top  talent  no  matter  their  objectives  in  seeking  employment.  To  that  end,  we  strive  to  foster  an  engaged,  diverse, inclusive, safe, purpose-driven culture where employees, referred to as \"team members,\" have equitable opportunities for success.\n\nAs of January 29, 2022, we employed approximately 450,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal team members. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, employment levels peak in the holiday season. We also engage independent contractors, most notably in our Shipt subsidiary.\n\nOur  Board  of  Directors,  through  the  Compensation  and  Human  Capital  Management  Committee,  oversees  human  capital management matters.\n\n## Talent Development and Engagement\n\nWe offer a compelling work environment with meaningful experiences and abundant growth and career-development opportunities. This  starts  with  the  opportunity  to  do  challenging  work  and  learn  on  the  job  and  is  supplemented  by  programs  and  continuous learning  that  help  our  team  build  skills  at  all  levels,  including  programs  focused  on  specialized  skill  development,  leadership opportunities, coaching, and mentoring. Our talent and succession planning process supports the development of a diverse talent pipeline for leadership and other critical roles. We monitor our team members' perceptions of these commitments through a number of surveys and take steps to address areas needing improvement.\n\n## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWe embrace diversity and strive to give our team members equitable access to opportunities. We champion workplace diversity and an  inclusive  work  environment  with  a  focus  on  attracting,  engaging,  developing  and  advancing  diverse  talent.  We  monitor  the representation of women and racially or ethnically diverse team members at different levels throughout the company and disclose the composition of our team in our annual Workforce Diversity Report (which includes demographic information using the categories disclosed in our EEO-1 report). Developing teams where team members feel heard, respected, and included is a core Target value and is fundamental to creating an inclusive guest experience.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our team members and their families. We believe in paying team members equitably, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, and we regularly review the pay data of U.S. team members to confirm that we are doing so. Our compensation packages include a starting wage of at least $15 per hour for U.S. hourly team members (who comprise the vast majority of our team), a 401(k) plan with matching contributions up to five percent of eligible earnings, paid vacation and holidays, family leave, merchandise and other discounts, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare and dependent care flexible spending accounts, debt-free education assistance and tuition reimbursement, free  mental  health  services,  an  annual  short-term  incentive  program,  long-term  equity  awards,  and  health  insurance  benefits, including free virtual health care visits. Eligibility for, and the level of, benefits vary depending on team members' full-time or parttime status, work location, compensation level, and tenure.",

This downward trend suggests a gradual reduction in the proportion of purchases made using the credit card, which may indicate weakening engagement or shifting consumer preferences despite Target's continued emphasis on card-linked discounts and loyalty benefits. However, Target's internal analysis still indicates that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on the card contribute to incremental sales, suggesting some ongoing strategic value.",

Guests receiv e a 5 percent discount on v irtually all purchases when they use a T arget Circle Card at T arget. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using T arget Circle Cards (T arget Circle Card Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful  portion  of  incremental  purchases  on  our  T arget  Circle  Cards  are  also  incremental  sales  for  T arget.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, product regulation increasingly constrained Philip Morris International's ability to differentiate its reduced-risk products (RRPs) and later its smoke-free products (SFPs), with growing regulatory pressure evident across all three years. In 2022, the company noted that product regulation limited its ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricted adult consumer access to truthful information about RRPs. By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize that such regulation not only restricted communication but also disproportionately impacted the commercialization of RRPs relative to competitors. In 2024, the company replaced 'RRPs' with 'SFPs' and reiterated similar concerns, indicating a continued regulatory burden on product differentiation and consumer engagement, suggesting a deepening regulatory challenge that has persisted and possibly intensified over the three-year period.",

We  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected  by  an  unfavorable  outcome  of  pending  or  future  investigations.  See  Item  8,  Note  17. Contingencies-Other  Litigation and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Operating  Results  by  Business  SegmentBusiness Environment-Governmental Investigations' for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject.\n\n## We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and disputes relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business.\n\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable assets, and their protection is important to our business. If the steps we take to protect our intellectual  property  rights  globally,  including  through  a  combination  of  trademark,  design,  patent,  trade  secrets  and  other  intellectual property rights, are inadequate, or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights, notwithstanding legal protection, our business  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Moreover,  failing  to  manage  our  existing  and/or  future  intellectual  property  may  place  us  at  a competitive  disadvantage.  Intellectual  property  rights  of  third  parties  may  limit  our  ability  to  commercialize  our  products  or  improve product quality in one or more markets. Competitors or other third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could divert management's attention, be costly, disruptive, time-consuming and unpredictable and expose us to significant litigation costs and damages, and impede our ability to manufacture, commercialize and improve our products, and thus have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our profitability. In addition, if, as a result, we are unable to manufacture or sell our RRPs or improve their quality in one or more markets, our ability to convert adult smokers to our RRPs in such markets would be adversely affected.  See  Item  8,  Note  17. Contingencies-Other Litigation to  our  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for  a  description  of certain intellectual property proceedings.\n\n## Risks Related to our Competitive Environment\n\n## We face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs. Competitors  in  our  industry  include  three  large  international  tobacco  companies,  new  market  entrants,  particularly  with  respect  to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Some competitors have different profit, volume and regulatory objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. Certain new market entrants in the noncombustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific  substantiation  based  on  appropriate  R&amp;D  protocols  and  standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our RRPs, all of which could have a mutual adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions, accessibility to our products and availability of accurate information related to our products.",

This consistent inclusion of Imperial Brands PLC, alongside the repeated emphasis on these four characteristics each year, indicates that PM maintained a stable strategic benchmarking approach, aligning with major international consumer product and tobacco companies.

We  are  a  leading  international  tobacco  company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long-term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector.  Our  current  product  portfolio  primarily  consists  of  cigarettes  and  reduced-risk  products,  including  heat-not-burn,  vapor  and  oral nicotine  products,  which  are  sold  in  markets  outside  the  United  States.  Since  2008,  we  have  invested  more  than  $9  billion  to  develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas  of  pre-clinical  systems  toxicology,  clinical  and  behavioral  research,  as  well  as  post-market  studies.  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of a version of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. We describe  the  MRTP  order  in  more  detail  in  the  \"Business  Environment\"  section  of  Item  7. Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life-sciences, in February 2021, we announced our ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet patient and consumer needs.\n\nIn March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  to  smoke. We  have  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development,  scientific  assessment  and  commercialization.  Our  RRPs  are  smoke-free  products  that  contain  and/or  generate  far  lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.  Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our HEETS , HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO ( defined collectively as \" HEETS\") , Marlboro  Dimensions , Marlboro HeatSticks,  Parliament  HeatSticks and TEREA, as  well  as  the  KT&amp;G-licensed  brands, Fiit and Miix (outside of South Korea). Platform 1 was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014. As of December 31, 2021, our smoke-free products are available for sale in 71 markets in key cities or nationwide.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro , the world's best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 38% of our total 2021 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Bond Street, Chesterfield, L&amp;M , Lark and Philip Morris. These seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 79% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2021. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A in Indonesia, and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\nDuring  2021,  we  laid  the  foundation  for  our  long-term  growth  ambitions  beyond  nicotine  in  wellness  and  healthcare,  including  the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S, which provide essential capabilities for future product development.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries.

Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023. Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 3.7% in 2024.\n\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China.

      "question": "How has MDLZ's exposure to sales and media marketing restrictions evolved across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to front-of-pack labeling requirements and jurisdictional expansion of extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ noted that over 25 EU countries had implemented EPR policies and that restrictions on advertising products with specified nutrient profiles were in place, with similar policies being considered in India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. By 2023, the company reiterated the same EPR expansion but emphasized increased attention to front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles and environmental claims, while also noting that single-use plastic bans and taxes were being considered in Indonesia and the Philippines. In 2024, MDLZ observed that the EU had formally adopted the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, and EPR policies were now being implemented or contemplated in India, Vietnam, and U.S. states, indicating a shift from contemplation to enforcement. The trend shows a growing regulatory burden across more jurisdictions, with increasing specificity around marketing restrictions tied to health and environmental claims.",

We  are  also  subject  to  legislation  designed  to  reduce  emissions  from greenhouse gases, and many countries are considering introducing carbon taxes that could increase our production costs or those of our suppliers.\n\nWe continue to monitor dev elopments in laws and regulations.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe discuss our ESG goals and programs in detail in our annual Snacking Made Right ESG report available on our website. Under Snacking Made Right - Reporting and Disclosure , we also publish an ESG disclosure data sheet that outlines our alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') reporting frameworks. We also provide our CDP Climate Change , Water Security and Forests annual disclosures.\n\nWe have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions. Each year since we created Mondel\u0113z International in 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ('DJSI') - World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the 96th percentile of our industry according to the latest DJSI report issued in November 2021.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, data privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes; labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials; crossborder trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and packaging taxes. In addition, over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility ('EPR') policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. EPR policies are being implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the United States. Single-use plastic bans and other plastic taxes are being considered in Europe as well as countries including Indonesia and the Philippines.",

      "question": "How did MDLZ's allocation to buy-in annuity policies in its non-U.S. pension plans evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's pension risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "MDLZ's allocation to buy-in annuity policies in its non-U.S. pension plans increased from 11% in 2022 to 17% in 2023, and remained stable at 17% in 2024. This trend indicates a strategic shift toward annuitization to manage pension risk, particularly in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as the company moved away from more volatile asset classes like equity securities and hedge funds in favor of more stable, insurance-backed instruments.",

        "Hop 1: [MDLZ](2023) \u2192 [Buy-In Annuity Policies]: Allocation in non-U.S. plans was 16% in 2023 (down slightly from 17% in 2022 per prior year data), indicating a continued emphasis on annuitization.",
        "Hop 2: [MDLZ](2024) \u2192 [Buy-In Annuity Policies]: The company disclosed that the fair value of buy-in annuity policies (excluding the MDLZ Global Plan buy-in) is calculated using a replacement policy value basis, reflecting a more formalized and structured approach to managing these assets.",
        "Hop 3: [MDLZ](2022) \u2192 [Buy-In Annuity Policies]: Allocation in non-U.S. plans was 11% in 2022, showing the lowest level of annuitization among the three years, with a greater exposure to equity securities and hedge funds."

These bundles enhance our portfolio to address ev olv ing consumer preferences and market trends, nutritional  needs  as  well  as  reduce  our  env ironmental  impact.  We  work  to  test  and  learn  new  ideas  and implement successful ones into other areas of our business. T o driv e growth, creativ ity, greater effectiv eness, improv ed efficiency and accelerated project deliv ery, we are focusing our technical research and dev elopment resources at technical centers around the globe.\n\nMindful snacking and sustainability are a significant focus of our current research and dev elopment initiativ es. We work to introduce new v arieties of our core products, including new taste or nutrition profiles that cater to ev olv ing consumer preferences, such as the launch in the UK of Cadbury Dairy Milk &amp; MORE , a multi-dimensional tablet designed to deliv er a richer, more indulgent eating experience, zero-sugar Oreo's in China and reduced sugar candies under The  Natural  Confectionary  Company brand  in Australia.  We  continue  to  expand  our  portfolio  of  cakes  and  pastries  in  new  markets  and  with updated formats including Milka brownies a nd Oreo cakes .\n\nWe  also  hav e  a  dedicated  innov ation  and  v enture  hub,  SnackFutures,  specifically  tailored  to  lev erage  emerging  consumer  trends  and  growth opportunities in mindful snacking.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MDLZ's approach to marketing and advertising regulations has evolved from general acknowledgment of regulatory pressures to more structured governance and strategic alignment with ESG frameworks. In 2022, the company highlighted the implementation of front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles and restrictions on advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain platforms, particularly across over 25 EU countries. By 2023, MDLZ expanded its focus to include environmental claims in labeling and emphasized the uneven scrutiny caused by the lack of harmonized global regulations, which could impact operations. In 2024, the company elevated its response by embedding ESG goals\u2014including marketing and packaging regulations\u2014into its Board-level governance structure through the Governance, Membership and Sustainability Committee, aligning these goals with risk and strategic planning and integrating them into leadership incentive programs. These changes indicate a shift toward proactive compliance and strategic adaptation, likely incurring increased compliance costs and necessitating adjustments in marketing spend and product positioning to align with evolving regulatory expectations, particularly in Europe and other key markets like India, Vietnam, and the U.S.",

        "Hop 2: MDLZ(2023) \u2192 Marketing and Advertising Regulations: The company expanded its regulatory focus to include environmental claims and highlighted the operational risk from non-harmonized global enforcement, indicating a growing strategic concern.",
        "Hop 3: MDLZ(2024) \u2192 Marketing and Advertising Regulations: MDLZ embedded marketing and packaging regulations into Board-level ESG oversight and linked them to leadership incentives, showing a matured governance approach and strategic prioritization."

Our ESG goals are part of our risk and strategic planning processes and are also embedded across our organization and within our annual incentiv e compensation program for our leadership. Business leadership teams and our Board of Directors regularly rev iew progress toward these programs and priorities.\n\nWe discuss  our  ESG  goals  and  programs  in  detail  in  our  annual  Snacking  Made  Right  report  av ailable  on  our  website.

We also prov ide our annual CDP Climate Change, Water Security and Forests disclosure.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and knowhow) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain v alid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. T rademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also hav e patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cov er inv entions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products  themselv es.  Our  issued  patents  extend  for  v arying  periods  according  to  the  date  of  patent  application  filing  or  grant  and  the  legal  term  of patents in the v arious countries where patent protection is obtained. T he actual protection afforded by a patent, which can v ary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its cov erage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the av ailability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products.  Similarly,  we  sell  some  products  under  brands,  patents  and/or  proprietary  trade  secrets  we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party  v arious  licenses  to  use  certain  of  our  and  their  respectiv e  intellectual  property  rights  in  named  jurisdictions  following  the  spin-off  of  our  North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational laws and regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and adv ertising, and related areas. In addition, v arious jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to gov ernment agricultural policy and interv ention. These policies hav e substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic gov ernmental and administrativ e rev iew . In addition, increased attention to env ironmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to the dev elopment of differences in gov ernment rules across jurisdictions. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to unev en scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include, without limitation, workplace safety regulations; selectiv e food taxes; data priv acy and cybersecurity; ingredients, products, processing or other food-related",

Each year since we created Mondel\u0113z International in 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ('DJSI') - World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the 96th percentile of our industry according to the latest DJSI report issued in November 2021.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, data privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes; labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials; crossborder trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and packaging taxes. In addition, over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility ('EPR') policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. EPR policies are being implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the United States. Single-use plastic bans and other plastic taxes are being considered in Europe as well as countries including Indonesia and the Philippines.",

      "question": "How did MDLZ's exposure to evolving corporate tax policies in the United States and other countries change from 2022 through 2024, and what regulatory developments during this period most significantly influenced its global operational cost structure?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MDLZ consistently identified corporate tax policies as a key regulatory factor affecting its global operations. In 2022, the company noted the impact of corporate tax policies across multiple jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S., and highlighted the influence of environmental and social regulations on operational scrutiny. By 2023, MDLZ emphasized the increasing attention to environmental and social issues in supply chains, noting that the lack of harmonized regulation could lead to uneven enforcement and operational impact. In 2024, the company observed that many EU countries had implemented extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, and the EU adopted the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, further increasing regulatory complexity. Additionally, carbon tax considerations in multiple countries were noted as potential cost drivers. The trajectory shows a growing regulatory burden related to tax and environmental policies, particularly in Europe and Southeast Asia, which increasingly influenced MDLZ's cost structure and compliance planning.",

      "question": "How did Philip Morris's capital structure strategy evolve from 2022 through 2024 as evidenced by the active management of other debt instruments alongside the consistent presence of the 3.875% Notes due 2042?",
      "answer": "Philip Morris maintained the 3.875% Notes due 2042 as a stable component of its long-term debt across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024), while actively managing its broader debt portfolio. In 2022, the company had 4.125% Notes due 2043 and 4.875% Notes due 2043 as part of its capital structure, which were no longer listed in the 2024 filing. In 2023, the company continued to carry the 3.875% Notes due 2042 alongside newer instruments such as the 4.125% Notes due 2043 and 4.250% Notes due 2044. By 2024, the newer 2043 and 2044 tranches had been retired or refinanced, and no new long-dated notes beyond 2042 were introduced, suggesting a shift toward stabilizing the long-term capital structure. This pattern indicates a strategy of maintaining long-term funding through the consistent 3.875% Notes due 2042 while selectively refinancing or retiring other instruments to optimize capital structure over time.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, product regulation increasingly constrained Philip Morris International\u2019s (PMI) competitive positioning, particularly affecting its Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs) and later its Smoke-Free Products (SFPs). In 2022, the company emphasized how regulation restricted adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about RRPs and limited product differentiation. By 2023, the language evolved to include how regulation disproportionately impacted the commercialization of PMI\u2019s products relative to competitors and highlighted the growing influence of digital media in spreading misleading information about RRPs. In 2024, the company specifically linked product regulation to restrictions on adult consumer access to truthful information about SFPs, signaling a strategic shift in product focus while maintaining concerns about unfair competition and regulatory asymmetries. This evolution shows a consistent and intensifying regulatory pressure that has adapted alongside PMI\u2019s product transitions, increasingly limiting the company\u2019s ability to effectively market and differentiate its next-generation tobacco products.",

        "Hop 3: [PM](2022) \u2192 [Product Regulation]: In 2022, PMI highlighted that regulation limited product differentiation and access to truthful information about RRPs, setting the baseline for how regulatory pressure was already affecting its competitive positioning."

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

If the steps we take to protect our intellectual  property  rights  globally,  including  through  a  combination  of  trademark,  design,  patent,  trade  secrets  and  other  intellectual property rights, are inadequate, or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights, notwithstanding legal protection, our business  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Moreover,  failing  to  manage  our  existing  and/or  future  intellectual  property  may  place  us  at  a competitive  disadvantage.

In addition, if, as a result, we are unable to manufacture or sell our RRPs or improve their quality in one or more markets, our ability to convert adult smokers to our RRPs in such markets would be adversely affected.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs. Competitors  in  our  industry  include  three  large  international  tobacco  companies,  new  market  entrants,  particularly  with  respect  to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Some competitors have different profit, volume and regulatory objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. Certain new market entrants in the noncombustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific  substantiation  based  on  appropriate  R&amp;D  protocols  and  standards.

In 2023, the company reiterated its reliance on local brands like Jackpot, emphasizing their role in complementing international brands and sustaining market share in key geographies such as the Philippines. By 2024, despite a broader strategic pivot toward smoke-free products and wellness, Jackpot remained a named local brand in the Philippines, suggesting that PMI continued to value its role in market-specific competitiveness.

Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023. Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 3.7% in 2024.\n\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China. Past reported periods may be updated to ensure comparability and to incorporate the most current information for industry and market share reporting.",

We  are  a  leading  international  tobacco  company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long-term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector.  Our  current  product  portfolio  primarily  consists  of  cigarettes  and  reduced-risk  products,  including  heat-not-burn,  vapor  and  oral nicotine  products,  which  are  sold  in  markets  outside  the  United  States.  Since  2008,  we  have  invested  more  than  $9  billion  to  develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas  of  pre-clinical  systems  toxicology,  clinical  and  behavioral  research,  as  well  as  post-market  studies.  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of a version of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. We describe  the  MRTP  order  in  more  detail  in  the  \"Business  Environment\"  section  of  Item  7. Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life-sciences, in February 2021, we announced our ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet patient and consumer needs.\n\nIn March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  to  smoke. We  have  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development,  scientific  assessment  and  commercialization.  Our  RRPs  are  smoke-free  products  that  contain  and/or  generate  far  lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.  Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our HEETS , HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO ( defined collectively as \" HEETS\") , Marlboro  Dimensions , Marlboro HeatSticks,  Parliament  HeatSticks and TEREA, as  well  as  the  KT&amp;G-licensed  brands, Fiit and Miix (outside of South Korea). Platform 1 was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014. As of December 31, 2021, our smoke-free products are available for sale in 71 markets in key cities or nationwide.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro , the world's best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 38% of our total 2021 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Bond Street, Chesterfield, L&amp;M , Lark and Philip Morris. These seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 79% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2021. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A in Indonesia, and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\nDuring  2021,  we  laid  the  foundation  for  our  long-term  growth  ambitions  beyond  nicotine  in  wellness  and  healthcare,  including  the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S, which provide essential capabilities for future product development.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized.

      "question": "How did Altria's structural relationship and financial exposure to UST evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of intangible asset valuation, ownership structure, and integration into Altria's broader smoke-free transition strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria's indefinite-lived intangible assets included $8.8 billion in MST and snus trademarks from UST, reflecting the legacy value of the 2009 acquisition. By 2023, UST remained a wholly owned subsidiary through its subsidiary USSTC, continuing to manufacture and sell MST and snus products, indicating sustained ownership and operational integration. In 2024, UST continued as a wholly owned subsidiary, with its subsidiary USSTC still engaged in MST production, but Altria's broader portfolio strategy shifted toward oral nicotine pouches via Helix and e-vapor via NJOY, suggesting a strategic evolution where UST's traditional MST business remained a core asset but was increasingly complemented by newer, potentially less harmful tobacco alternatives. This 3-year trajectory shows Altria maintaining UST's financial value while strategically diversifying around it.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MO](2022) \u2192 [UST]: UST's trademarks valued at $8.8 billion in indefinite-lived intangible assets as of 2022, reflecting the legacy impact of the 2009 acquisition.",
        "Hop 2: [MO](2023) \u2192 [UST]: UST remained a wholly owned subsidiary, with its subsidiary USSTC continuing to manufacture MST and snus products, indicating ongoing operational and financial integration.",
        "Hop 3: [MO](2024) \u2192 [UST]: UST continued as a wholly owned subsidiary, but Altria's strategic emphasis shifted toward newer products like oral nicotine pouches (Helix) and e-vapor (NJOY), suggesting UST's MST business remained valuable but was part of a broader, evolving portfolio."

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria disclosed its 1.700% 2025 Notes as part of its capital structure alongside other debt instruments such as the 1.000% 2023 Notes, 2.200% 2027 Notes, and 3.125% 2031 Notes. By 2023, the 1.000% 2023 Notes had matured and were no longer listed, indicating Altria had met its obligation for that instrument, while the 1.700% 2025 Notes remained a key component of its debt portfolio. In 2024, the 1.700% 2025 Notes were still actively listed, suggesting Altria maintained this liability as part of its mid-term capital strategy.

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria's pension plan had 16% of fixed income holdings (or ~11% of total plan assets) allocated to below investment grade securities, while the postretirement plan had 8% of fixed income holdings (or ~3% of total plan assets) in the same category. By 2023, the pension allocation to below investment grade securities decreased to 11% of fixed income holdings (or ~9% of total plan assets), and the postretirement allocation increased slightly to 9% of fixed income holdings (or ~4% of total plan assets). In 2024, specific percentages for below investment grade allocations were not disclosed, but the overall strategy remained focused on long-duration fixed income.

Altria's pension and postretirement plans also invest in actively managed international equity securities of mid and small cap companies located in developed and emerging markets. For pension plan assets, the allocation to below investment grade securities represented approximately 16% of the fixed income holdings or approximately 11% of the total plan assets at December 31, 2021. The allocation to emerging markets represented less than 1% of total plan assets at December 31, 2021. For postretirement plan assets, the allocation to below investment grade securities represented approximately 8% of the fixed income holdings or approximately 3% of the total plan assets at December 31, 2021. There were no postretirement plan assets invested in emerging markets at December 31, 2021.\n\nAltria's risk management practices for its pension and postretirement plans include (i) ongoing monitoring of asset allocation, investment performance and investment managers' compliance with their investment guidelines, (ii) periodic rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes and (iii) annual actuarial re-measurement of plan liabilities.\n\nAltria's expected rate of return on pension and postretirement plan assets is determined by the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. The forward-looking estimates are consistent with the long-term historical averages exhibited by returns on equity and fixed income securities. As a result of the target asset allocation change described above, Altria has reduced its expected rate of return assumption for determining its pension net periodic benefit cost (income) from 6.6% in 2021 to 6.1% in 2022. For determining its postretirement net periodic benefit cost (income), Altria's 2022 expected rate of return assumption remains unchanged from prior year at 7.7%.",

      "answer": "From fiscal 2022 to 2024, Walmart consistently positioned 'Holiday Time' as a private label brand within its General Merchandise unit, specifically tied to seasonal merchandise. In 2022, the brand was listed among other private brands under General Merchandise, which included seasonal items. In 2023, Walmart emphasized the seasonal nature of its operations, noting that its highest sales volume historically occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31, reinforcing the importance of seasonal product lines like 'Holiday Time'. By 2024, despite reorganizing its merchandise units (renaming Apparel to Fashion), Walmart maintained 'Holiday Time' within General Merchandise, signaling continued strategic emphasis on seasonal product offerings as a key component of its retail calendar. This consistency suggests a sustained focus on leveraging private label brands to drive holiday-driven consumer demand.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's 'Parent's Choice' brand evolve from 2022 to 2024 in relation to changes in its strategic merchandise unit structure?",
      "answer": "Walmart consistently included 'Parent's Choice' as part of its private brand portfolio across all three years (2022\u20132024), indicating ongoing strategic emphasis on the brand within its merchandise offerings. However, the broader structural categorization of merchandise units evolved during this period. In 2022, Walmart U.S. was organized into three strategic merchandise units: Grocery, General Merchandise (which included Apparel), and Health and Wellness. By 2023, there was no explicit mention of structural reorganization, but in 2024, Apparel was reclassified under 'Fashion' as a distinct subcategory within General Merchandise, signaling a refinement in how product lines were grouped. Despite these structural shifts, 'Parent's Choice' remained listed among key private brands, suggesting it was maintained as a stable component of Walmart\u2019s private label strategy even as broader merchandising categories were realigned. This demonstrates a consistent brand identity and product positioning for 'Parent's Choice' amid evolving internal categorization strategies.",

We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 164 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations by leveraging our ability to deliver directly from stores and shipping from our 29 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's strategic positioning of the 'No Boundaries' private brand evolve across its merchandise units from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year branding consistency reveal about Walmart's private label strategy in general merchandise?",
      "answer": "Walmart consistently positioned 'No Boundaries' as a core private brand within its general merchandise offerings across all three years. In 2022, 'No Boundaries' was listed among key private brands under the General Merchandise strategic unit, which included Apparel and Home categories. In 2023, the brand remained a highlighted private brand, even as Walmart emphasized omni-channel expansion and supply chain investments. By 2024, 'No Boundaries' continued to be prominently listed among private brands, despite a reorganization of merchandise units that shifted 'Apparel' to a new 'Fashion' category. This 3-year continuity in branding suggests Walmart's deliberate effort to maintain and leverage strong private-label identities to differentiate offerings and support margin expansion in competitive categories.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's private brand strategy around Sam's Choice evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in light of the introduction of new private brands like 'bettergoods' in 2024 and the strategic reorganization of merchandise units across the three-year period?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Walmart maintained Sam's Choice as a core private brand within its merchandise portfolio, but introduced new private brands like 'bettergoods' in 2024, indicating a potential expansion or repositioning of its private label strategy. In 2022, Sam's Choice was listed among other private brands under the broader strategic merchandise units, which included Grocery, General Merchandise, and Health and Wellness. By 2023, the company continued to highlight Sam's Choice as part of its private brand lineup, but also emphasized omni-channel strategies and supply chain investments aimed at enhancing private brand availability and efficiency. In 2024, Walmart introduced 'bettergoods' into its private brand lineup, signaling a potential shift toward more value-oriented or sustainability-focused offerings, while also reorganizing its merchandise units\u2014renaming 'Apparel' to 'Fashion' and maintaining Sam's Choice within the same category structure. This evolution suggests a deliberate effort to refine and expand the private brand ecosystem, with Sam's Choice maintaining its foundational role while new brands like 'bettergoods' target specific consumer segments or preferences.",

      "question": "How did Costco's accounting treatment and disclosure around free-rent periods in lease agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of recognition methodology and its impact on right-of-use asset valuation?",
      "answer": "Costco consistently applied a straight-line recognition methodology for free-rent periods and step-rent provisions across all three years (2022\u20132024), recognizing these on a straight-line basis over the original lease term and any extension options the company is reasonably certain to exercise. However, in 2022, the company explicitly disclosed its use of discounted future minimum lease payments to initially record right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations, using its incremental borrowing rate derived from quoted interest rates. This detailed explanation of the discounting process and ARO (asset retirement obligation) treatment was not repeated in the 2023 and 2024 filings, suggesting a shift toward more standardized ASC 842 compliance language without elaborating on the valuation mechanics. While the core accounting policy remained stable, the depth and specificity of disclosure around ROU asset valuation decreased over time, indicating a possible maturation of lease accounting practices post-adoption period.",

For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying v alue of the asset group is considered recov erable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and ev entual disposition of the asset group exceed the respectiv e carrying v alue. In the ev ent that the carrying  v alue  is  not  considered  recov erable,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  the  asset  group  to  be  held  and  used  equal  to  the  excess  of  the carrying  v alue  abov e  the  estimated  fair  v alue  of  the  asset  group.  For  asset  groups  classified  as  held-for-sale  (disposal  group),  the  carrying  v alue  is compared to the disposal group's fair v alue less costs to sell. T he Company estimates fair v alue by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other v aluation techniques. Impairment charges recognized in 2024 and 2023 were immaterial. In 2022, the Company recognized a write-off of $118 for information technology assets, which is reflected in SG&amp;A.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company leases land, buildings, and/or equipment at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market v alue or purchase price stated in the agreement; (c) a right of first refusal in the ev ent of a third-party offer; or (d) a right of first offer if the landlord intends to sell.\n\nSome leases include free-rent periods and step-rent prov isions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases prov ide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales v olume, which are recognized as v ariable lease payments.

Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nThe Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit  in  the  Company's  leases  is  not  easily  determinable,  the  present  value  of  the  sum  of  the  lease  payments  is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, net above.\n\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception  of  the  lease  term,  based  upon  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  costs  to  remove  the  improvements.  These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same  depreciation method  as  the leasehold improvement  assets  and  are  included with buildings  and improvements.  Estimated  ARO  liabilities  associated  with  these  leases  are  included  in  other  liabilities  in  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization.  The  Company  reviews  goodwill  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  for  impairment  or  when  circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair  value  based  on  expected  discounted  future  cash  flows,  while  the  market  approach  uses  comparable  public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\n\nGoodwill  is  included  in  other  long-term  assets  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  following  table  summarizes goodwill by reportable segment:\n\n",

      "answer": "Costco's 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 remained constant at $1,250 million in 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating that the company did not alter its principal exposure to this specific debt instrument over the three-year period. However, the broader long-term debt structure changed, with total long-term debt decreasing from $6,590 million in 2022 to $6,484 million in 2023, and further declining to $5,919 million in 2024.

In 2024, Costco maintained this strategic emphasis while also pointing to international expansion as a growth lever, noting that multiple competing clubs, including BJ\u2019s, were present in major metropolitan areas and certain international markets.

      "answer": "Costco consistently disclosed the Executive Health Plan (Exhibit 10.1*) in its 10-K filings across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, with the plan always referencing the same 'Period Ended' date of September 2, 2012, and the same 'Filing Date' of October 19, 2012. This indicates no material updates or amendments to the plan were filed during this three-year period, suggesting that Costco maintained a stable long-term executive benefit strategy without structural changes to this specific plan.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Always was categorized under 'Baby, Feminine & Family Care' with a focus on both 'Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care)' and baby care products like Pampers. By 2023, the brand remained in the same segment but the product categorization shifted to 'Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Menstrual Care)', indicating a more specific focus on feminine health and hygiene. In 2024, Always remained in the same segment but the product categorization was further refined to 'Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Menstrual Care)', with no mention of broader family care subcategories, reinforcing a strategic narrowing toward core feminine care needs. This evolution shows a consistent but increasingly specialized positioning of the Always brand within P&G's portfolio.",

      "answer": "Dawn remained a consistently highlighted brand within P&G's Fabric & Home Care segment across all three years (2022\u20132024), indicating its sustained strategic importance. In 2022, the segment accounted for 35% of net sales and 31% of earnings, with Dawn listed among key brands. By 2023, the segment maintained its dominance at 36% of net sales and 34% of earnings, again featuring Dawn prominently. In 2024, the Fabric & Home Care segment continued to represent 36% of net sales and 34% of earnings, with Dawn still positioned as a major brand. This consistency suggests that Dawn remained a core contributor to the segment's performance, with no indication of reduced emphasis or strategic repositioning over the three-year period.",

In 2024, the description added 'other similar items' to the list, which wasn't explicitly mentioned in 2022 or 2023. This suggests a slight broadening of the product segment definition in 2024 to potentially include new categories.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive consistently included Sorriso in its trademark portfolio across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014as part of its Oral, Personal and Home Care segment. The consistent mention of Sorriso in each year's filing indicates that the brand remained a strategically relevant regional trademark in key markets. However, in 2024, the company added more structured go-to-market channels such as 'eCommerce retailers' and 'skin health professionals' in the distribution description, suggesting a broader integration of Sorriso within omnichannel retail strategies. This evolution reflects a continuity in brand presence with an emerging emphasis on digital and specialized distribution, aligning with broader trends in consumer engagement.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Colgate-Palmolive reported an operating profit of $203 million from the Africa/Eurasia region, indicating a relatively modest contribution compared to other regions. In 2023, as part of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, the company allocated 10% of its expected restructuring charges\u2014approximately $20 to $24 million\u2014to Africa/Eurasia, signaling a strategic effort to streamline operations in the region. By 2024, depreciation and amortization expenses for Africa/Eurasia had declined to $8 million, down from $9 million in both 2022 and 2023, suggesting reduced capital investment or aging asset bases. This 3-year trajectory reflects a consistent but low-level financial presence in the region, with limited growth investment and a focus on cost optimization rather than expansion.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Walmart consistently included Marketside as part of its private brand portfolio, highlighting its ongoing commitment to the brand within the grocery category. In 2022, Marketside was listed among key private brands like Great Value and George, indicating its foundational role in Walmart's grocery offerings. In 2023, Marketside remained a named private brand, suggesting continuity in Walmart's strategy to maintain a diversified private label presence. By 2024, Marketside continued to be featured, even as Walmart introduced new private brands like 'bettergoods,' signaling a strategic expansion and modernization of its private label lineup while maintaining legacy brands like Marketside.

      "question": "How has Walmart's positioning of the 'Holiday Time' brand in its General Merchandise category evolved across fiscal years 2022\u20132024, and what does this pattern suggest about its strategic role during seasonal retail periods?",
      "answer": "Walmart consistently positioned the 'Holiday Time' brand within its General Merchandise category across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating its enduring strategic importance in seasonal retail offerings. In 2022, 'Holiday Time' was listed under General Merchandise, which included seasonal merchandise as a key subcategory. In 2023, Walmart again included 'Holiday Time' among its private brands under General Merchandise and emphasized the seasonal nature of its U.S. business, noting that its highest sales volume historically occurs in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. In 2024, 'Holiday Time' remained under General Merchandise, which continued to encompass seasonal merchandise as a core component. This consistent inclusion over three years suggests that 'Holiday Time' plays a stable and strategic role in Walmart\u2019s holiday and seasonal retail strategy, supporting its efforts to meet consumer demand during peak shopping periods.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's private brand 'No Boundaries' evolve across its merchandise strategy from 2022 to 2024, particularly in the context of changes to Walmart U.S.'s strategic merchandise units and fulfillment capabilities during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, 'No Boundaries' was listed under the Apparel category within the General Merchandise strategic unit. By 2023, the brand remained a part of the private brand lineup, but the Apparel category was more broadly integrated into Walmart's omni-channel offerings, reflecting a shift toward digital integration and customer-centric convenience. In 2024, while 'No Boundaries' remained part of the private brand portfolio, Walmart U.S. restructured its strategic merchandise units, renaming the Apparel segment to 'Fashion,' which encompassed both adult and children's wear. Additionally, fulfillment capabilities expanded from 162 distribution centers in 2023 to 164 in 2024, with 29 dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers in 2024, suggesting a growing emphasis on digital sales and direct-to-customer logistics that would support private brands like 'No Boundaries.' This evolution indicates a strategic shift from traditional retail positioning toward a digitally enabled, fashion-focused private brand strategy.",

        "Hop 1: [WMT](2022) \u2192 [No Boundaries]: Listed under Apparel in General Merchandise unit, indicating a traditional retail positioning.",

        "Hop 3: [WMT](2024) \u2192 [No Boundaries]: Apparel renamed to 'Fashion' in strategic units, and fulfillment infrastructure expanded, supporting e-commerce growth for private brands."

      "question": "How did Walmart's private brand 'Sam's Choice' evolve in prominence within its U.S. merchandise portfolio from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024, and what does this 3-year progression indicate about Walmart's private label strategy?",
      "answer": "Walmart consistently listed 'Sam's Choice' as one of its key private brands in its U.S. merchandise portfolio across fiscal 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating sustained strategic emphasis on the brand. In 2022, 'Sam's Choice' was included among a list of 21 private brands, alongside 'Great Value' and 'Equate', suggesting it was one of several core private labels. In 2023, the brand was again listed among 21 private brands, maintaining its position in the portfolio. By 2024, Walmart had streamlined its private brand list to 20, removing 'Bonobos Fielder' and 'bettergoods' while retaining 'Sam's Choice', signaling continued prioritization despite brand portfolio adjustments. This 3-year consistency indicates that 'Sam's Choice' remains a stable and strategic component of Walmart\u2019s private label offerings, reflecting its ongoing relevance in the company\u2019s branding and merchandising strategy.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria highlighted UST as a key subsidiary, owning its trademarks valued at $8.8 billion, and emphasized amortization expenses tied to its acquisition. By 2023, Altria reaffirmed UST's role as a wholly owned subsidiary through its consolidated subsidiaries structure, maintaining its engagement in moist smokeless tobacco (MST) and snus products. In 2024, Altria further solidified UST's integration by describing it as a core operating company under its broader 'Moving Beyond Smoking' initiative, aligning UST's MST products with Altria's strategic pivot toward reduced-risk tobacco offerings. This evolution shows a consistent emphasis on UST as a strategic asset, with increasing alignment toward Altria's vision of transitioning adult smokers to less harmful products.",

      "question": "How did the listing status and composition of Altria's debt instruments on the New York Stock Exchange evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly with respect to the 1.700% Notes due 2025 in relation to other note maturities?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Altria maintained the 1.700% Notes due 2025 as a consistently listed instrument on the New York Stock Exchange. However, the composition of its other listed debt instruments changed: in 2022, the 1.000% Notes due 2023 were listed alongside the 1.700% Notes due 2025, but by 2023 and 2024, the 2023 notes had been removed, indicating their maturity and retirement. This shows a natural progression in Altria's debt structure as shorter-term notes matured and were not replaced in the listing, while the 2025 notes remained a key part of the company's publicly traded debt profile.",

        "Hop 2: [MO](2023) \u2192 [1.700% 2025 Notes]: The 1.700% Notes due 2025 remained listed on the NYSE, but the 1.000% Notes due 2023 were no longer listed, suggesting they matured and were retired.",
        "Hop 3: [MO](2024) \u2192 [1.700% 2025 Notes]: The 1.700% Notes due 2025 continued to be listed on the NYSE, with no re-introduction of 2023 maturity notes, confirming the transition in Altria's debt structure."

          "chunk_text": "\nAltria's pension and postretirement plan asset performance is monitored on an ongoing basis to adjust the mix as necessary to achieve the target allocation.\n\nSubstantially all pension and all postretirement assets can be used to make monthly benefit payments.\n\nAltria's investment objective for its pension and postretirement plan assets is accomplished by investing in long-duration fixed income securities that primarily include U.S. corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and U.S. Treasury securities that mirror Altria's pension obligation benchmark, as well as U.S. and international equity index strategies that are intended to mirror broad market indices, including, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and Morgan Stanley Capital International ('MSCI') Europe, Australasia, and the Far East ('EAFE') Index. Altria's pension and postretirement plans also invest in actively managed international equity securities of mid and small cap companies located in developed and emerging markets. For pension plan assets, the allocation to below investment grade securities represented approximately 16% of the fixed income holdings or approximately 11% of the total plan assets at December 31, 2021. The allocation to emerging markets represented less than 1% of total plan assets at December 31, 2021. For postretirement plan assets, the allocation to below investment grade securities represented approximately 8% of the fixed income holdings or approximately 3% of the total plan assets at December 31, 2021. There were no postretirement plan assets invested in emerging markets at December 31, 2021.\n\nAltria's risk management practices for its pension and postretirement plans include (i) ongoing monitoring of asset allocation, investment performance and investment managers' compliance with their investment guidelines, (ii) periodic rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes and (iii) annual actuarial re-measurement of plan liabilities.\n\nAltria's expected rate of return on pension and postretirement plan assets is determined by the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. The forward-looking estimates are consistent with the long-term historical averages exhibited by returns on equity and fixed income securities. As a result of the target asset allocation change described above, Altria has reduced its expected rate of return assumption for determining its pension net periodic benefit cost (income) from 6.6% in 2021 to 6.1% in 2022. For determining its postretirement net periodic benefit cost (income), Altria's 2022 expected rate of return assumption remains unchanged from prior year at 7.7%.",

      "answer": "The listing status of Altria's 3.125% 2031 Notes remained consistent across the three years, maintaining its presence on the New York Stock Exchange (or its abbreviated form, NewYorkStockExchange, in 2024). In 2022, the 3.125% Notes due 2031 were listed under the symbol MO31 on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2023, the same notes retained their listing under MO31 on the same exchange. In 2024, the 3.125% Notes due 2031 continued to be listed on the NewYorkStockExchange, maintaining the MO31 ticker symbol. This consistent listing pattern suggests that Altria maintained a stable capital structure and continued to rely on this debt instrument as a long-term financing vehicle throughout the period, without seeking alternative exchanges or delisting strategies.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Altria's strategic positioning and financial commitment to UST remained foundational but evolved in the context of broader corporate transformation. In 2022, UST's MST and snus trademarks were valued at $8.8 billion, representing a major component of Altria's indefinite-lived intangible assets, underscoring UST's historical significance. In 2023, UST LLC remained a wholly owned subsidiary through which USSTC continued manufacturing and selling MST and snus products, maintaining its role within Altria's portfolio. By 2024, UST continued to anchor Altria's oral tobacco segment, but its relative prominence diminished as Altria integrated NJOY and expanded its oral nicotine pouches via Helix, aligning more directly with the 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision. Thus, while UST remained a core asset, Altria's innovation and acquisition strategy increasingly emphasized newer, less harmful nicotine delivery systems.",

        "Hop 3: [MO](2022) \u2192 [UST]: UST's MST and snus trademarks were valued at $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, making it a key component of Altria's intangible asset base."

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria had a 1.000% Note due 2023 in addition to the 1.700% Note due 2025 and longer-dated instruments. By 2023, the 1.000% Note due 2023 had matured or was no longer listed, while the 1.700% Note due 2025 remained as the shortest-dated instrument. In 2024, the 1.700% Note due 2025 was still listed, indicating that Altria did not issue a new near-term note to replace it as it approached maturity. This suggests a strategy of maintaining a consistent capital structure with a focus on intermediate and long-term debt rather than rolling over short-term obligations.",

      "question": "How did Altria's allocation to U.S. Treasury and foreign government securities evolve across 2022-2024, and what does this trend indicate about its pension asset strategy?",
      "answer": "Altria's allocation to U.S. Treasury and foreign government securities within its pension and postretirement plan assets decreased from 19% in 2022 to 16% in 2023, before dropping further to 8% in 2024. This steady decline indicates a strategic shift away from government-backed fixed income instruments toward other asset categories, likely reflecting a recalibration of risk exposure and return expectations. The reduction in allocation aligns with a broader trend of lowering exposure to below-investment-grade securities\u2014from 11% of fixed income holdings in 2023 to 9% in 2024 for pension assets\u2014and suggests a more conservative or diversified investment posture over time. Additionally, the expected rate of return on pension assets was reduced from 6.6% in 2022 to 6.1% in 2023 and remained at 6.1% in 2024, indicating a more cautious long-term outlook as the asset mix evolved.",

Altria's pension and postretirement plans also invest in actively managed international equity securities of mid and small cap companies located in developed and emerging markets. For pension plan assets, the allocation to below investment grade securities represented approximately 16% of the fixed income holdings or approximately 11% of the total plan assets at December 31, 2021. The allocation to emerging markets represented less than 1% of total plan assets at December 31, 2021. For postretirement plan assets, the allocation to below investment grade securities represented approximately 8% of the fixed income holdings or approximately 3% of the total plan assets at December 31, 2021. There were no postretirement plan assets invested in emerging markets at December 31, 2021.\n\nAltria's risk management practices for its pension and postretirement plans include (i) ongoing monitoring of asset allocation, investment performance and investment managers' compliance with their investment guidelines, (ii) periodic rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes and (iii) annual actuarial re-measurement of plan liabilities.\n\nAltria's expected rate of return on pension and postretirement plan assets is determined by the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. The forward-looking estimates are consistent with the long-term historical averages exhibited by returns on equity and fixed income securities. As a result of the target asset allocation change described above, Altria has reduced its expected rate of return assumption for determining its pension net periodic benefit cost (income) from 6.6% in 2021 to 6.1% in 2022. For determining its postretirement net periodic benefit cost (income), Altria's 2022 expected rate of return assumption remains unchanged from prior year at 7.7%.",

      "answer": "The 3.125% Notes due in 2031 were consistently listed in Altria\u2019s capital structure across all three years (2022, 2023, and 2024), indicating its ongoing role in the company's long-term debt portfolio. In 2022, the 3.125% 2031 Notes were listed alongside the 1.000% Notes due 2023 (MO23A), which were not present in 2023 or 2024 filings, suggesting those short-term notes matured or were retired. The consistent presence of the 3.125% 2031 Notes, while other instruments like the 1.000% 2023 Notes exited the structure, implies that Altria maintained a strategic long-term liability profile anchored by this mid-yield instrument. This pattern reveals a capital strategy that rolls off shorter-term debt while retaining longer-duration obligations like the 3.125% Notes due in 2031.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Always was listed under 'Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care)' within the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment, appearing alongside brands like Always Discreet, Tampax, Bounty, Charmin, and Puffs. By 2023, the product categorization shifted slightly to 'Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Menstrual Care)', and Always was more specifically associated with menstrual care, reflecting a more targeted positioning. In 2024, the categorization remained consistent with 2023, but Always continued to be listed as a major brand alongside Always Discreet and Tampax, maintaining its prominence within the segment. This evolution suggests a strategic sharpening of Always\u2019 positioning around menstrual care while retaining its core role in the Feminine Care category.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's positioning of the Marketside brand evolve from 2022 to 2024 within its omnichannel grocery strategy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Walmart's positioning of the Marketside brand remained consistent as a private-label offering within the grocery category, but became increasingly tied to the company\u2019s omnichannel strategy. In 2022, Marketside was listed among other private brands like 'George' and 'Great Value' without specific strategic emphasis. In 2023, the brand was again listed among private brands, but Walmart emphasized its omnichannel initiatives such as pickup, delivery, and Walmart+, signaling a broader integration of private-label offerings into digital experiences. By 2024, Marketside was still listed among private brands, but Walmart explicitly linked its grocery offerings to its fulfillment ecosystem, including 29 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and ship-from-store capabilities, suggesting a deeper integration of the brand into the omnichannel shopping experience. This evolution shows that while the brand itself remained a consistent part of the portfolio, its role increasingly aligned with Walmart\u2019s digital transformation and seamless shopping initiatives.",

      "question": "How has Walmart's categorization and strategic positioning of the 'Holiday Time' private brand evolved across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's approach to seasonal merchandise within its broader private label portfolio?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart categorized 'Holiday Time' within its private brands under the broader merchandise portfolio, alongside other private brands like 'George' and 'Great Value,' without specific strategic emphasis on seasonal offerings. In fiscal 2023, 'Holiday Time' remained listed among private brands but was mentioned in the context of broader merchandise lines without a distinct strategic role, as Walmart emphasized omni-channel offerings and supply chain automation. By fiscal 2024, 'Holiday Time' continued to be listed among private brands, but Walmart explicitly restructured its merchandise units to include 'seasonal merchandise' as a defined category under General Merchandise, signaling a more strategic placement of holiday-themed products within a dedicated seasonal framework. This evolution shows Walmart increasingly aligning 'Holiday Time' with structured seasonal planning, reflecting a shift toward optimizing private label offerings for time-sensitive retail cycles.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's private brand 'No Boundaries' fit within the evolving strategic merchandise units from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's shifting focus in apparel and fashion categories?",
      "answer": "In 2022, 'No Boundaries' was listed under the 'Apparel' category within Walmart U.S.'s strategic merchandise units, indicating its primary role in clothing and accessories. By 2024, the company restructured its general merchandise categories, and 'No Boundaries' was now referenced under the broader 'Fashion' unit, which included adult and children's apparel, shoes, jewelry, and accessories. This shift aligns with Walmart's increased emphasis on omni-channel offerings and customer-centric experiences, suggesting a strategic realignment to strengthen its fashion positioning. The continuity of 'No Boundaries' in all three years (2022\u20132024) highlights its consistent importance as a private brand, while its categorization evolved in line with Walmart's broader merchandising strategy.",

      "question": "How has Walmart's categorization and strategic positioning of its Sam's Choice brand evolved across merchandise units from fiscal 2022 to 2024, and what does this shift suggest about its private label strategy?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Sam's Choice was listed among other private brands without explicit linkage to specific merchandise units, indicating a more general branding approach. By fiscal 2023, the brand was still present but embedded within a broader context of omni-channel offerings and supply chain investments, suggesting a growing integration into Walmart's operational strategy. In fiscal 2024, Sam's Choice was explicitly categorized under strategic merchandise units including Grocery, General Merchandise, and Health and Wellness, showing a deliberate alignment with core retail categories. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward positioning Sam's Choice as a versatile and category-spanning private brand, aimed at enhancing customer trust and driving margin expansion through targeted private label offerings.",

      "answer": "The Coca-Cola Company consistently referenced the 0.125% Notes due 2029 in its filings across all three years (2022\u20132024), indicating ongoing acknowledgment of this liability. However, the context in which it was referenced changed. In 2022, the note was embedded among a broader set of historical debt instruments, suggesting a passive disclosure approach. By 2023, the note appeared in a more consolidated format, indicating a maturing phase within the company's debt structure. In 2024, while the 0.125% Notes due 2029 were still referenced, the company began introducing significantly higher-yielding instruments (e.g., 5.000% Notes due 2034 and 5.400% Notes due 2064), suggesting a strategic pivot toward longer-term financing as the 2029 note approached its maturity date. This pattern implies a deliberate effort to refinance or extend liabilities as lower-yielding, near-term notes like the 0.125% Notes due 2029 neared expiration.",

      "question": "How does the persistent reference to the 1.000% Notes due 2028 in Coca-Cola's filings from 2022 through 2024, combined with the introduction of higher-yield notes in 2024 such as the 5.000% Notes due 2034 and 5.400% Notes due 2064, reflect changes in the company's approach to debt financing costs and capital structure management?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola consistently referenced the 1.000% Notes due 2028 in its 10-K filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating the ongoing importance of this low-interest debt instrument in its capital structure. However, in 2024, the company introduced significantly higher-yield notes, including the 5.000% Notes due 2034 and the 5.400% Notes due 2064. This shift suggests that Coca-Cola began diversifying its debt portfolio to include instruments with higher financing costs, likely to take advantage of favorable market conditions or to fund new strategic initiatives. The contrast between the stable, low-cost 1.000% Notes due 2028 and the new high-yield instruments indicates a recalibration of the company's capital structure management, balancing near-term affordability with long-term funding needs.",

        "Hop 2: KO(2023) \u2192 1.000% Notes due 2028: The 1.000% Notes due 2028 were again referenced in Exhibit 4.26 in the 2023 filing, indicating that this instrument remained a stable part of Coca-Cola's capital structure.",
        "Hop 3: KO(2024) \u2192 1.000% Notes due 2028: The 1.000% Notes due 2028 were once more referenced in Exhibit 4.26 in the 2024 filing, but were now listed alongside new higher-yield notes such as the 5.000% Notes due 2034 (Exhibit 4.39) and the 5.400% Notes due 2064 (Exhibit 4.41), signaling a shift toward incorporating more expensive debt into the capital structure."

      "question": "How did The Coca-Cola Company's issuance of long-term debt instruments, specifically the 3.000% Notes due 2051, evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about the company's long-term financing strategy?",
      "answer": "The Coca-Cola Company consistently referenced the 3.000% Notes due 2051 in its filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating ongoing reliance on this long-term debt instrument as part of its capital structure. In 2022, the note was introduced as part of Exhibit 4.36 in the 10-K filing, referencing its incorporation from a May 5, 2021 Form 8-K filing. In 2023, the note was again referenced in Exhibit 4.36, maintaining the same structure and incorporation details. By 2024, the 3.000% Notes due 2051 remained a referenced instrument in Exhibit 4.36, continuing to be incorporated from the same May 5, 2021 Form 8-K filing. Despite the company introducing newer notes with different interest rates and maturity dates in 2024 (e.g., 5.000% Notes due 2034, 5.400% Notes due 2064), the consistent mention of the 3.000% Notes due 2051 across all three years suggests a strategic emphasis on maintaining long-duration, fixed-rate debt to support its capital structure and manage interest rate risk.",

      "question": "How did The Coca-Cola Company's issuance of long-term debt instruments, particularly the 1.000% Notes due 2041, evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this pattern indicate about the company's long-term capital strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, KO referenced the 1.000% Notes due 2041 as part of its long-term debt structure, indicating a strategy of securing long-duration capital at stable rates. In 2023, the company continued to reference the same 1.000% Notes due 2041, showing consistency in its long-term debt disclosures. By 2024, while the 1.000% Notes due 2041 were still referenced, KO also introduced a new set of long-term notes with significantly higher interest rates, such as the 5.400% Notes due 2064 and the 5.200% Notes due 2055. This evolution suggests a shift in the company\u2019s capital strategy in response to rising interest rates, where it began locking in longer-term debt at higher yields to potentially hedge against future rate increases.",

        "Hop 1: KO(2022) \u2192 1.000% Notes due 2041: Introduced as part of a suite of long-term debt instruments, indicating early strategic use of low-rate, long-duration financing.",
        "Hop 2: KO(2023) \u2192 1.000% Notes due 2041: Continued referencing the same instrument, showing continuity in long-term capital structure and no immediate refinancing or repricing.",
        "Hop 3: KO(2024) \u2192 1.000% Notes due 2041: Still referenced, but now alongside newly issued high-yield long-term notes, indicating a shift in capital strategy amid rising interest rates."

      "question": "How did The Coca-Cola Company's reliance on 'estimates of sales proceeds' as a valuation methodology for nonpublic investments evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's changing approach to fair value assessment in emerging markets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola disclosed the use of 'estimates of sales proceeds' as part of its valuation methodology for nonpublic investments, specifically in the context of impairment assessments where quoted market prices were unavailable. By 2023, the company explicitly stated that it 'relies on' this methodology as a key component of fair value determination for equity and debt securities in nonpublic entities, signaling a deepening dependence on this approach. In 2024, Coca-Cola continued to 'use' estimates of sales proceeds alongside discounted cash flows and appraisals, but with an increased emphasis on the challenges of predicting future cash flows\u2014particularly in emerging and developing markets\u2014suggesting a more cautious application of the methodology over time. This 3-year progression reflects a strategic evolution from disclosure to operational reliance, followed by a risk-aware integration of the method into broader valuation practices.",

          "chunk_text": "Statements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review' below for additional information related to our present business environment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. ('CCBJHI') exceeded its fair value by $87 million, or 18 percent. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge related to the investment.\n\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\n\n## Investments in Equity and Debt Securities\n\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 4: INVESTMENTS\n\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value, with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair values of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company's fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\n\n## Equity Securities\n\nThe carrying values of our equity securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How has Cascade's positioning within P&G's home care portfolio evolved from 2022 to 2024, based on its segment reporting across the three most recent 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Cascade has maintained consistent positioning within P&G's Home Care sub-category under the Fabric & Home Care segment across all three reporting periods. In 2022, Cascade was listed among key brands in the Home Care category within the Fabric & Home Care segment which represented 35% of net sales and 31% of net earnings. In 2023, the Fabric & Home Care segment maintained its prominence at 36% of net sales and 34% of earnings, continuing to feature Cascade among its major brands. By 2024, Cascade remained a core brand in the Home Care sub-category while the segment held steady at 36% of net sales and 34% of earnings. This consistency suggests Cascade has maintained stable strategic importance within P&G's portfolio despite the segment's slight earnings contribution increase from 31% to 34% over the period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Tampax was grouped under a broader 'Feminine Care' category that included both 'Adult Incontinence' and 'Feminine Care' subcategories within the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment, which accounted for 25% of net sales. By 2023, the category was more specifically defined as 'Menstrual Care' under the same segment, which represented 24% of net sales. In 2024, the structure remained consistent with 'Menstrual Care' as a distinct subcategory under 'Feminine Care', continuing to fall within the 24% segment.

      "answer": "In 2022, the 2.750% Senior Note due 2051 was first introduced in a list of notes within a broader Board of Directors resolution (Exhibit 4.60), indicating initial authorization and planning. By 2023, the documentation had progressed to include a dedicated 'Form of 2.750% Senior Note due 2051' (Exhibit 4.51), suggesting that the instrument had moved from authorization to formal structuring and disclosure. In 2024, the note continued to be referenced with the same exhibit number (4.48), showing consistency in documentation and no material revision to the note's form. This progression reflects a deliberate, phased approach to long-term debt issuance, with early planning in 2022, formalization in 2023, and maintenance of structure in 2024, indicating stability in PepsiCo\u2019s long-term capital strategy.",

      "answer": "The 5.50% Senior Note due 2035 was consistently referenced across all three years, indicating ongoing documentation and potential refinancing or rollover activity. In 2022, it was listed as 'Form of 5.50% Senior Note due 2035, Series A' (Exhibit 4.31) referencing an 8-K filing from November 8, 2018. In 2023, the same note was referenced again (Exhibit 4.25) with the same filing history, showing continued acknowledgment of this debt instrument. In 2024, the note reappeared (Exhibit 4.23), again tied to the same 2018 filing. This repeated inclusion suggests that PepsiCo maintained this long-term debt obligation on its books without retiring or modifying it during the three-year period, signaling a stable, long-duration capital structure approach.",

      "question": "What does PepsiCo's consistent inclusion of the 3.000% Senior Note due 2027 across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings reveal about its medium-term debt financing strategy?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's consistent inclusion of the 3.000% Senior Note due 2027 across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings indicates a deliberate and stable approach to its medium-term debt financing. The note was first introduced in the 2022 filing (Exhibit 4.22), reaffirmed in the 2023 filing (Exhibit 4.19), and maintained in the 2024 filing (Exhibit 4.17). This consistency suggests that PepsiCo has preserved this instrument as a key component of its capital structure, signaling a strategic preference for stable, fixed-rate financing over variable instruments during a period of economic uncertainty and fluctuating interest rates.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's use of the 3.450% Senior Note due 2046 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this pattern suggest about its long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "The 3.450% Senior Note due 2046 was referenced in all three annual filings\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014indicating consistent inclusion in PepsiCo's long-term debt disclosures. In 2022, the note was listed among other senior notes as part of the company's broader debt structure, with its terms incorporated by reference to a 2016 filing. In 2023, the note appeared again in the exhibit list, maintaining its original description and again pointing to the October 6, 2016, Form 8-K filing for its terms. In 2024, the note remained in the exhibit list, continuing to reference the same 2016 filing for its form and terms. The consistent presence of this note across all three years suggests that PepsiCo has maintained this long-term debt instrument as a stable component of its capital structure without altering its terms or retiring the note. This reflects a strategy of relying on fixed long-term obligations to support financial stability and capital flexibility.",

      "answer": "The Palmolive brand has remained a consistently listed principal global trademark in Colgate's disclosures from 2022 through 2024, indicating its sustained strategic importance within the company's core product portfolio. In 2022, Palmolive was positioned among key global brands like Colgate and Ajax, underscoring its role in home and personal care categories. In 2023, it maintained its place despite the addition of Darlie to the list, signaling continued emphasis on its market presence. By 2024, Palmolive remained among the top-tier trademarks without any positional dilution, reinforcing its enduring relevance in Colgate's global branding strategy. This 3-year consistency suggests that Palmolive continues to play a foundational role in supporting the company\u2019s market position in key categories like liquid hand soap, dishwashing detergents, and household cleaners.",

      "question": "How did Colgate-Palmolive's (CL) allocation to U.S. Treasury and agency securities within its pension plan fixed income portfolio evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's approach to interest rate risk management during this period?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's allocation to U.S. Treasury and agency securities within its pension plan fixed income portfolio decreased from 50% as of December 31, 2020 (disclosed in the 2022 filing) to 40% as of December 31, 2021, then further declined to 30% as of December 31, 2022 (reported in the 2023 filing), and remained steady at 30% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 (reported in the 2024 filing). This gradual reduction over two years followed by stabilization suggests a strategic shift away from government-backed securities toward other government bonds and corporate bonds, potentially reflecting a response to rising interest rates during this period. The company maintained a Level 2 classification for these securities, indicating continued over-the-counter trading with limited daily pricing or liquidity, which aligns with an approach that balances interest rate risk with liquidity considerations.",

        "Hop 2: [Colgate-Palmolive](2023) \u2192 [Net Asset Value Funds]: Allocation dropped further to 30% as of December 31, 2022, showing continued movement toward higher-yielding or more diversified fixed income instruments.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MDLZ faced an expanding scope of sales and media marketing restrictions, particularly in the European Union and emerging markets. In 2022, over 25 EU countries had implemented Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies, and single-use plastic bans or taxes were being considered in Indonesia and the Philippines. By 2023, this trend continued with EPR policies being contemplated in India and Vietnam, and in 2024, the European Union formally adopted the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, further intensifying regulatory pressure. These developments indicate a growing regulatory burden, especially in Europe and parts of Southeast Asia, requiring MDLZ to adapt its marketing and packaging strategies across key markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe discuss our ESG goals and programs in detail in our annual Snacking Made Right ESG report available on our website. Under Snacking Made Right - Reporting and Disclosure , we also publish an ESG disclosure data sheet that outlines our alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') reporting frameworks. We also provide our CDP Climate Change , Water Security and Forests annual disclosures.\n\nWe have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions. Each year since we created Mondel\u0113z International in 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ('DJSI') - World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the 96th percentile of our industry according to the latest DJSI report issued in November 2021.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, data privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes; labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials; crossborder trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and packaging taxes. In addition, over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility ('EPR') policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. EPR policies are being implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the United States. Single-use plastic bans and other plastic taxes are being considered in Europe as well as countries including Indonesia and the Philippines.",

      "question": "How has MDLZ's disclosure around regulatory scrutiny of marketing and advertising evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to restrictions on advertising products with specified nutrient profiles and the geographic expansion of such regulations?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MDLZ's disclosures indicate a growing emphasis on the geographic expansion and intensification of marketing and advertising regulations related to nutrient profiles. In 2022, the company noted that such restrictions were being applied in certain jurisdictions, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. By 2023, MDLZ expanded its disclosure to include specific mention of 'sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day,' and highlighted the spread of these regulations across Europe, India, Vietnam, and U.S. states. In 2024, the company reiterated the global nature of these challenges and added that it is adapting its ESG and marketing strategies under Board oversight, particularly through the Governance, Membership and Sustainability Committee. This progression shows an increasing regulatory burden and a strategic shift toward structured governance and transparency in response.",

Under Snacking Made Right - Reporting and Disclosure , we also publish an ESG disclosure data sheet that outlines our alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') reporting frameworks. We also provide our CDP Climate Change , Water Security and Forests annual disclosures.\n\nWe have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions. Each year since we created Mondel\u0113z International in 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ('DJSI') - World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the 96th percentile of our industry according to the latest DJSI report issued in November 2021.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, data privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes; labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials; crossborder trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and packaging taxes. In addition, over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility ('EPR') policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. EPR policies are being implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the United States. Single-use plastic bans and other plastic taxes are being considered in Europe as well as countries including Indonesia and the Philippines.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ noted that over 25 EU countries had implemented EPR policies, making manufacturers responsible for recycling costs, and that such policies were being considered in India, Vietnam, and certain U.S. states. By 2023, the company repeated the 25-country figure but added that single-use plastic bans and plastic taxes were under consideration in Southeast Asia, suggesting growing concern over regional expansion of these policies. In 2024, MDLZ noted that the European Union had formally adopted the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, indicating a shift from contemplation to binding legislation in core markets. This 3-year progression shows MDLZ's increasing recognition of EPR as a concrete compliance burden, particularly in Europe, with implications for packaging costs and operational planning.",

Each year since we created Mondel\u0113z International in 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ('DJSI') - World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the 96th percentile of our industry according to the latest DJSI report issued in November 2021.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, data privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes; labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials; crossborder trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and packaging taxes. In addition, over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility ('EPR') policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. EPR policies are being implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the United States. Single-use plastic bans and other plastic taxes are being considered in Europe as well as countries including Indonesia and the Philippines.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's long-term debt strategy evolve from 2022 through 2024 as evidenced by changes in the mix of senior notes referenced, particularly in relation to the consistent inclusion of the 4.000% Senior Note due 2047?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's long-term debt strategy showed increasing diversification in senior note structures while maintaining the 4.000% Senior Note due 2047 as a consistent reference point. In 2022, the company referenced senior notes with varied maturities and interest rates including the 4.000% Senior Note due 2047 (filed May 2, 2017) alongside shorter-term floating rate notes and 2.250% Senior Notes due 2022. By 2023, PepsiCo continued referencing the 4.000% Senior Note due 2047 while introducing higher-yield instruments like the 7.00% Senior Note due 2029 (Series A) and the 7.29% Senior Note due 2026, suggesting a strategy to access different segments of the debt market. In 2024, the company maintained the 4.000% Senior Note due 2047 reference while introducing newer instruments like the 0.750% Senior Note due 2027, indicating a continued emphasis on long-term financing with a mix of fixed and variable rate instruments.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's 2.750% Senior Note due 2051 was first introduced in 2022 as part of a broader set of debt instruments outlined in the 10-K filing, signaling its inclusion in the company's long-term financing strategy. In 2023, the note was formally issued and documented as part of PepsiCo\u2019s debt portfolio, with its form filed on October 21, 2021, and incorporated by reference. By 2024, the note remained a consistent component of the company's long-term debt structure, reaffirmed alongside newer issuances like the 5.250% Senior Note due 2054. This 3-year pattern shows a deliberate effort to maintain long-duration debt instruments to support stable capital structure and manage interest rate exposure.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's issuance and documentation of the 5.50% Senior Note due 2035 evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern indicate about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "Across the three years, PepsiCo consistently referenced the 5.50% Senior Note due 2035 in its disclosures, showing that it remained a part of the company's long-term debt portfolio. In 2022, the note was referenced in Exhibit 4.35 tied to Registration Statement No. 333-228466 filed on November 19, 2018. In 2023, the same note was again referenced in Exhibit 4.29 under the same registration statement, indicating no change in structure or terms. In 2024, the note continued to appear in filings, again under Exhibit 4.27 tied to the same 2018 registration. This consistent documentation across years suggests that PepsiCo maintained this long-term debt instrument without modification, signaling a stable capital structure and long-term financing strategy.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's treatment of its 3.000% Senior Note due 2027 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this consistent reference pattern reveal about the company's debt management strategy in the context of its consumer staples business model?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo consistently referenced its 3.000% Senior Note due 2027 across all three years\u2014Exhibit 4.22 in 2022, Exhibit 4.19 in 2023, and Exhibit 4.17 in 2024\u2014without altering its terms. This unchanging treatment reflects a deliberate debt management strategy aligned with the stable cash flow profile typical of consumer staples companies. PepsiCo\u2019s approach to maintaining fixed-rate obligations like this note supports financial predictability, which is particularly advantageous in its sector where consistent demand for products allows for reliable revenue streams. This strategy enables the company to lock in financing costs while continuing to fund long-term initiatives such as capital expenditures, marketing, and shareholder returns, all of which are emphasized in its capital allocation priorities across the filings.",

      "answer": "The consistent disclosure of the 3.450% Senior Note due 2046 across all three years\u2014in Exhibit 4.17 in 2022, Exhibit 4.16 in 2023, and Exhibit 4.15 in 2024\u2014indicates that this instrument remained a stable and integral component of PepsiCo\u2019s long-term debt financing strategy throughout the period. The repeated inclusion of this specific note, without any indication of modification or removal, suggests it was strategically maintained to support the company\u2019s capital structure, likely providing long-dated, fixed-rate funding. This consistency implies that PepsiCo viewed the note as a reliable source of capital with favorable terms that aligned with its broader financial planning over the three-year horizon.",

      "answer": "Costco consistently disclosed the 2.750% Senior Notes due May 18, 2024, in all three annual filings (2022, 2023, and 2024), with no changes to the stated maturity date or interest rate across the years. The structure and presentation of the notes remained unchanged in the exhibit listings, indicating that the company maintained the same disclosure format and did not alter the fundamental terms of this debt instrument. This consistency suggests that the 2.750% Senior Notes remained a stable component of Costco's capital structure throughout the three-year period, with no early redemption, restructuring, or rollover activity disclosed.",

      "answer": "Costco consistently applied a straight-line basis for recognizing free-rent periods and step-rent provisions over the lease term, including extension options that the company is reasonably certain to exercise, across all three years. In 2022, the company emphasized its use of the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments, derived from quoted interest rates. In 2023, the disclosure expanded to clarify how variable lease payments tied to price indices or sales volume were treated separately but still aligned with the same accounting policy. By 2024, the company maintained the same accounting treatment but placed greater emphasis on impairment evaluation of long-lived assets, indicating a heightened focus on lease-related asset valuations in the context of facility relocations or closures. While the core accounting policy remained stable, the context in which it was presented evolved to reflect growing operational complexity in lease management.",

Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nThe Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit  in  the  Company's  leases  is  not  easily  determinable,  the  present  value  of  the  sum  of  the  lease  payments  is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, net above.\n\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception  of  the  lease  term,  based  upon  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  costs  to  remove  the  improvements.  These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same  depreciation method  as  the leasehold improvement  assets  and  are  included with buildings  and improvements.  Estimated  ARO  liabilities  associated  with  these  leases  are  included  in  other  liabilities  in  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization.  The  Company  reviews  goodwill  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  for  impairment  or  when  circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair  value  based  on  expected  discounted  future  cash  flows,  while  the  market  approach  uses  comparable  public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\n\nGoodwill  is  included  in  other  long-term  assets  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  following  table  summarizes goodwill by reportable segment:\n\n",

However, the classification of long-term debt evolved significantly. In 2022, long-term debt, excluding current portion, was $6,484 million, which decreased to $5,794 million by 2024. This decline was driven by the reclassification of the 2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 from long-term to current portion as the maturity date approached. The consistent $1,250 million value of the 1.375% Senior Notes shows Costco maintained its exposure to this instrument, while overall long-term debt composition shifted due to other maturities and reclassifications.",

      "question": "How did Costco's competitive positioning language against BJ's Wholesale Club evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly regarding the strategic emphasis on private-label brands like Kirkland Signature as a differentiator in warehouse club markets?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Costco consistently positioned itself in direct competition with BJ's Wholesale Club, emphasizing private-label brands like Kirkland Signature as a key differentiator. In 2022, Kirkland Signature was described as 'high quality, offered at prices generally lower than national brands,' with a focus on lowering costs and earning higher margins. In 2023, the language remained largely consistent, with an added emphasis on sustainability initiatives tied to brand loyalty, though not explicitly linked to Kirkland Signature. By 2024, the description of Kirkland Signature remained core to the competitive strategy, but the surrounding language introduced a stronger tone around 'differentiating our merchandise offerings' in the context of increasingly competitive metropolitan markets. While the core strategy remained stable, the evolution in tone suggests a growing emphasis on differentiation through private-label branding in response to competitive pressures from BJ's.",

However, there were subtle differences in how the exhibit table was presented and maintained across the years, reflecting potential internal documentation or formatting updates rather than changes to the plan itself. In 2023, the exhibit list included a more detailed set of filings and periods, suggesting enhanced transparency in exhibit referencing.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MDLZ faced an expanding scope and increasing stringency of sales and media marketing restrictions. In 2022, over 25 EU countries had implemented EPR policies, and bans or taxes on single-use plastics were being considered in Europe and Southeast Asia. By 2023, these restrictions were reiterated with the inclusion of data privacy as a regulatory area affecting marketing, and EPR policies were being implemented or contemplated in India, Vietnam, and U.S. states. In 2024, the EU formally adopted the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, and EPR policies continued to spread globally, with Southeast Asia actively considering plastic bans or taxes. The trajectory shows a clear expansion in both the geographic reach and the regulatory intensity of these constraints.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe discuss our ESG goals and programs in detail in our annual Snacking Made Right ESG report available on our website. Under Snacking Made Right - Reporting and Disclosure , we also publish an ESG disclosure data sheet that outlines our alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') reporting frameworks. We also provide our CDP Climate Change , Water Security and Forests annual disclosures.\n\nWe have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions. Each year since we created Mondel\u0113z International in 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ('DJSI') - World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the 96th percentile of our industry according to the latest DJSI report issued in November 2021.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, data privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes; labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials; crossborder trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and packaging taxes. In addition, over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility ('EPR') policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. EPR policies are being implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the United States. Single-use plastic bans and other plastic taxes are being considered in Europe as well as countries including Indonesia and the Philippines.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MDLZ's disclosures around marketing and advertising regulations have become more detailed and specific, particularly regarding data privacy, front-of-pack labeling, and EPR policies. In 2022, the company broadly referenced marketing and advertising regulations as part of a general regulatory framework, noting EPR policies in over 25 EU countries and their potential global expansion. By 2023, MDLZ explicitly included data privacy and front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient or environmental profiles as regulatory areas impacting marketing and advertising. In 2024, the company further reinforced its acknowledgment of these regulations, embedding them more deeply within its ESG governance structure and Board-level oversight, particularly under the Governance, Membership and Sustainability Committee. This progression suggests a growing strategic focus on regulatory compliance, especially around consumer data, product labeling transparency, and packaging waste responsibility, aligning with broader ESG goals and stakeholder expectations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe discuss our ESG goals and programs in detail in our annual Snacking Made Right ESG report available on our website. Under Snacking Made Right - Reporting and Disclosure , we also publish an ESG disclosure data sheet that outlines our alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') reporting frameworks. We also provide our CDP Climate Change , Water Security and Forests annual disclosures.\n\nWe have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions. Each year since we created Mondel\u0113z International in 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ('DJSI') - World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the 96th percentile of our industry according to the latest DJSI report issued in November 2021.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.\n\nWe own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nFrom time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business in 2012.\n\n## Regulation\n\nOur food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, data privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries. The lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations that affect our business include workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes; labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials; crossborder trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and packaging taxes. In addition, over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer responsibility ('EPR') policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. EPR policies are being implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the United States. Single-use plastic bans and other plastic taxes are being considered in Europe as well as countries including Indonesia and the Philippines.",

In 2024, the note was again disclosed in Exhibit 4.23 and 4.31, with no change in the referenced Exhibit 4.4 filings.

      "question": "How did The Coca-Cola Company's issuance of notes with a 1.000% interest rate due in 2028 evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this pattern suggest about the company's debt strategy for that specific instrument?",
      "answer": "The Coca-Cola Company consistently referenced the 1.000% Notes due 2028 in all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014indicating ongoing acknowledgment and potential maintenance of this debt instrument. However, in 2024, the company introduced significantly higher-yielding notes (e.g., 5.000% Notes due 2034 and 5.300% Notes due 2054), suggesting a broader strategic shift toward issuing higher-interest debt, while maintaining visibility on the 1.000% Notes due 2028. This implies that while the 1.000% Notes due 2028 remained part of the company's long-term debt structure, KO pursued more aggressive borrowing terms in 2024, possibly to fund new initiatives or refinance existing obligations.",

        "Hop 2: KO(2023) \u2192 1.000% Notes due 2028: In 2023, KO again referenced the 1.000% Notes due 2028 (Exhibit 4.26), showing continuity in the company's disclosure and likely ongoing liability management related to this instrument.",
        "Hop 3: KO(2024) \u2192 1.000% Notes due 2028: In 2024, KO once more included the 1.000% Notes due 2028 in its filings (Exhibit 4.26), maintaining consistency in disclosures. However, 2024 also introduced new, higher-interest notes (e.g., 5.000% Notes due 2034), signaling a shift in financing strategy."

      "question": "How did Coca-Cola's issuance of long-term debt instruments, particularly the 3.000% Notes due 2051, evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's capital structure strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola referenced the 3.000% Notes due 2051 in its 10-K filing (Exhibit 4.6 to the May 5, 2021 Form 8-K), indicating the instrument was part of a broader set of debt instruments with varying maturities and interest rates. In 2023, the company again included the 3.000% Notes due 2051 in its 10-K filing, maintaining the same exhibit reference, which shows continuity in its long-term debt portfolio. By 2024, Coca-Cola introduced new instruments with higher coupon rates, such as the 5.000% Notes due 2034 and the 5.300% Notes due 2054, while still retaining the 3.000% Notes due 2051 in its disclosures. This progression indicates that Coca-Cola maintained the 3.000% Notes due 2051 as a stable component of its capital structure while diversifying its debt portfolio with higher-yielding instruments, likely to balance long-term obligations with current market interest rate conditions.",

      "question": "How did Coca-Cola's long-term debt instrument strategy evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to the 1.000% Notes due 2041 and the introduction of higher-yielding notes in 2024?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola consistently referenced the 1.000% Notes due 2041 across all three years, first in 2022 (Exhibit 4.33), again in 2023 (Exhibit 4.33), and once more in 2024 (Exhibit 4.33). However, by 2024, the company introduced significantly higher-yielding debt instruments, including 5.000% Notes due 2034, 5.300% Notes due 2054, and 5.400% Notes due 2064. This marks a clear shift in financing strategy, as earlier years featured lower-yielding instruments like the 0.400% Notes due 2030 in 2022 and the 0.950% Notes due 2036 in 2023. The introduction of high-yield, long-duration notes in 2024 suggests a recalibration of the company's debt portfolio to align with changing market conditions.",

      "question": "How did The Coca-Cola Company's use of estimates of sales proceeds in valuing nonpublicly traded investments evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year progression reveal about management's approach to fair value assessment in emerging markets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola disclosed the use of estimates of sales proceeds as part of its valuation methodology for nonpublicly traded investments, specifically citing an $87 million temporary impairment for Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. In 2023, the company reaffirmed its reliance on estimates of sales proceeds as a core valuation method for nonpublic investments, emphasizing sensitivity to emerging market cash flow predictability. By 2024, Coca-Cola continued to apply estimates of sales proceeds but placed greater emphasis on their role alongside discounted cash flows and appraisals, signaling a more structured and consistent application of valuation methodologies. This evolution shows a maturing and formalization of fair value assessment practices, particularly for investments in markets where cash flow forecasting is challenging.",

          "chunk_text": "Statements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review' below for additional information related to our present business environment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. ('CCBJHI') exceeded its fair value by $87 million, or 18 percent. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge related to the investment.\n\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\n\n## Investments in Equity and Debt Securities\n\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge",

We use quoted market prices to determine the fair values of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company's fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income.

      "answer": "The Coca-Cola Company consistently referenced the 1.000% Notes due 2028 in its filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating ongoing reliance on this instrument as part of its broader debt financing strategy. In 2022 and 2023, the Notes due 2028 were listed among other debt instruments, showing continuity in referencing the September 18, 2020 filing as the source document. In 2024, while the 1.000% Notes due 2028 remained referenced, KO introduced a new set of higher-yielding notes (e.g., 5.000% Notes due 2034 and 5.300% Notes due 2054), suggesting a strategic shift toward issuing higher-yield debt instruments for longer-term financing needs. This evolution indicates a dual approach: maintaining existing lower-yield instruments for near-term obligations while leveraging rising interest environments for long-term capital.",

      "question": "How did The Coca-Cola Company's reliance on estimates of sales proceeds for valuing nonpublic equity investments evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about management's confidence in predicting recovery in markets like Japan where the carrying value exceeded fair value by $87 million in 2022?",
      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, The Coca-Cola Company consistently used estimates of sales proceeds as part of its valuation methodology for nonpublic equity investments, but the context and implications of these estimates evolved. In 2022, the company disclosed that the carrying value of its investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. exceeded its fair value by $87 million, or 18%, yet management deemed the decline temporary, indicating confidence in eventual recovery. In 2023 and 2024, the disclosures reiterated the use of estimates of sales proceeds as a valuation methodology but placed increasing emphasis on the assumptions a market participant would use in evaluating future cash flows, particularly in emerging and developing markets. This evolution suggests that while the company maintained its valuation methodology, it became more attuned to external market perspectives and macroeconomic risks, especially in regions where fair value predictions are more volatile.",

        "Hop 2: [KO](2024) \u2192 [Estimates of Sales Proceeds]: In 2024, KO maintained the same valuation methodology but increased focus on the importance of market participant assumptions, especially in emerging markets, suggesting a more cautious approach to predicting fair value.",
        "Hop 3: [KO](2022) \u2192 [Estimates of Sales Proceeds]: In 2022, KO disclosed a significant $87 million (18%) overvaluation of its investment in Japan, yet management judged the decline as temporary, showing strong confidence in recovery and the predictive power of its estimates of sales proceeds."

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 4: INVESTMENTS\n\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value, with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair values of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company's fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\n\n## Equity Securities\n\nThe carrying values of our equity securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Statements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review' below for additional information related to our present business environment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. ('CCBJHI') exceeded its fair value by $87 million, or 18 percent. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge related to the investment.\n\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\n\n## Investments in Equity and Debt Securities\n\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge",

      "question": "What does the consistent disclosure of PepsiCo's 4.000% Senior Note due 2047 across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings suggest about the company's long-term debt strategy, and how does this compare to its treatment of shorter-dated instruments like the 2.150% Senior Note due 2024 and the 0.750% Senior Note due 2027?",
      "answer": "The consistent disclosure of the 4.000% Senior Note due 2047 across all three filings (2022, 2023, and 2024) indicates that PepsiCo maintains a long-term liability management strategy focused on stable, extended-duration financing. This contrasts with the company's treatment of shorter-dated notes, such as the 2.150% Senior Note due 2024 (referenced in 2023) and the 0.750% Senior Note due 2027 (introduced in 2024), which appear in only one or two filings and likely reflect more time-sensitive capital needs or refinancing activities. The 2022 filing also included a 2.500% Senior Note due 2022, which had matured by 2023, further highlighting the dynamic nature of short-term debt versus the persistent presence of long-term obligations like the 2047 note. This pattern suggests PepsiCo is leveraging long-term debt to secure capital at fixed rates, reducing refinancing risk and supporting financial stability over decades.",

      "question": "What does PepsiCo's treatment of its 2.750% Senior Note due 2051 across 2022\u20132024 filings reveal about its long-term debt strategy in a rising interest rate environment?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's treatment of the 2.750% Senior Note due 2051 across 2022\u20132024 filings shows a consistent approach to long-term debt management, despite rising interest rates. In 2022, the note was listed among various other senior notes in the exhibit index, indicating it was part of a broader capital structure (PEP_10k_2022.pdf:page_135:chunk_1). In 2023, the note was explicitly called out in the exhibit index with a reference to the 2021 Form 8-K filing, suggesting it remained an active part of PepsiCo\u2019s long-term financing plans (PEP_10k_2023.pdf:page_128:chunk_2). In 2024, the note was again referenced in the same format and position as in 2023, showing no changes to its treatment even as newer, higher-yielding notes (e.g., 5.250% Senior Note due 2054) were introduced (PEP_10k_2024.pdf:page_129:chunk_2). This consistency suggests that PepsiCo maintained a stable long-term capital strategy, preserving access to long-dated, fixed-rate debt even as short-term borrowing costs rose.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's use of the 5.50% Senior Note due 2035 evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this consistent inclusion reveal about its long-term debt financing strategy relative to other instruments?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo consistently referenced the 5.50% Senior Note due 2035 across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K filings, demonstrating a strategic emphasis on this instrument as part of its long-term capital structure. In 2022 (Exhibit 4.35), 2023 (Exhibit 4.29), and 2024 (Exhibit 4.27), the note was linked to the same Registration Statement on Form S-4 (No. 333-228466) filed on November 19, 2018, indicating it was a core, unchanging component of its debt portfolio. The persistence of this note, alongside the introduction of newer, lower-yield instruments like the 0.750% Senior Note due 2027 (2024) and the 1.125% Senior Note due 2031 (2024), suggests a dual approach: maintaining stable, higher-yielding long-term obligations while also leveraging favorable interest environments for newer, cheaper debt. This indicates a balanced capital management strategy focused on both reliability and flexibility.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's inclusion and characterization of the 3.000% Senior Note due 2027 evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 annual filings, and what does this reveal about the company's long-term debt strategy?",
      "answer": "The 3.000% Senior Note due 2027 was consistently included in PepsiCo's annual filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating its ongoing significance in the company's capital structure. In 2022 (Exhibit 4.22), the note was listed among other senior notes, including the 2.150% Senior Note due 2024 and the 2.250% Senior Note due 2022, suggesting it was part of a broader set of medium-term financing instruments. In 2023 (Exhibit 4.19), the note was again included, this time alongside longer-dated instruments such as the 4.450% Senior Note due 2046 and the 3.450% Senior Note due 2046, indicating its role in a diversified debt maturity profile. In 2024 (Exhibit 4.17), the note continued to be referenced, now in the context of a filing that also included newer short-term notes like the 0.750% Senior Note due 2027 and the 1.125% Senior Note due 2031, suggesting a strategy of layering debt maturities to manage refinancing risk. While the interest rate and maturity date remained constant, the evolving context in which the 3.000% Senior Note due 2027 was presented indicates a consistent yet adaptive debt strategy that maintains certain fixed-rate liabilities while introducing newer, often lower-rate instruments to reflect market conditions.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's disclosures regarding its 3.450% Senior Note due 2046 evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about the company's long-term debt structure and refinancing strategy?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo consistently referenced the 3.450% Senior Note due 2046 in its filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating its ongoing presence in the company's long-term debt portfolio. In 2022, the note was listed as part of the company's broader debt instruments incorporated by reference to an October 6, 2016, filing. In 2023 and 2024, the note continued to appear in the same context, suggesting no material changes in its structure or status over the three-year period. This consistency implies that PepsiCo maintained this long-term obligation without amendment or refinancing during the observed timeframe, reflecting a stable approach to long-term capital structure.",
